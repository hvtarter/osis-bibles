        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the descendants of David according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>Making request, if by any means now at last I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that often I purposed to come unto you, (but was prevented thus far,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and deity; so that they are without excuse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was fitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not proper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you are that judge: for in what you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them who commit such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And do you think, O man, that judge them who do such things, and do the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart treasure up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who has the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You therefore who teach another, can you not teach yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law do you dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision verily profits, if you keep the law: but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore if the uncircumcision keeps the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And not rather, (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? are we better than they? No, in no way: for we have before proved both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace have they not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatsoever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Seeing it is one God, who shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham were justified by works, he has something in which to boast; but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his descendants, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the descendants; not to those only who are of the law, but to those also who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls those things which are not as though they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your descendants be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body as now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>So also is the free gift not like the offense. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>So is the gift not like it was by one that sinned: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak after the manner of men because of the weakness of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then if, while her husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband dies, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she is married to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are delivered from the law, being dead to that in which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, you shall not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of covetousness. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also bring to life your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, so that we may be also glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, that is, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helps our weakness: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man who does those things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness which is of faith speaks thus, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not arrogant, but fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also not spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and calling of God are unchangeable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>Or he that exhorts, on exhortation: he that gives, let him do it in simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Be tender loving one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; constant in prayer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless them who persecute you: bless, and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore you must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscienceâ€™s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Receive him that is weak in the faith, but not for passing judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him who eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yea, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But why do you judge your brother? or why do you despise your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if your brother is grieved with your food, you no longer walk in love. Destroy not him with your food, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>For food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good neither to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>And he that doubts is condemned if he eats, because he eats not of faith: for whatever is not of faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We then that are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing unto your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud him, all you people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some way, as reminding you, because of the grace that is given to me of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore that of which I may boast through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no more place of work in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way there by you, if first I am somewhat refreshed with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>It has pleased them greatly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in material things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
