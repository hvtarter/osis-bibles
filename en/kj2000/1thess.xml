        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that you were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves show of us what manner of welcome we had unto you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brethren, know our visit unto you, that it was not in vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be a burden unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and just and unblamable was our behavior among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As you know how we exhorted and encouraged and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to encourage you concerning your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for you yourselves know that we are appointed unto this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>Therefore, brethren, we were encouraged over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now God himself even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>To the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not in the lust of passion, even as the Gentiles who know not God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man transgress and wrong his brother in any matter: because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given unto us his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love you need not that I write unto you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And indeed you do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that you increase more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And that you study to be quiet, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That you may walk honestly toward them that are outside, and that you may have lack of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede them who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunk are drunk in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are idle, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Test all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
