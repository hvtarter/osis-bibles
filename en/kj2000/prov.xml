        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their riddles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shall be an ornament of grace unto your head, and chains about your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, consent not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all kinds of precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not in the way with them; refrain your foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain; which takes away the life of its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries aloud outside; she raises her voice in the open square:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But you have ignored all my counsel, and would have none of my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your terror comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They would have none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whosoever hearkens unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be secure from the fear of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words, and lay up my commandments with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So that you incline your ear unto wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yea, if you cry after knowledge, and lift up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then shall you understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a shield to them that walk uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>He keeps the paths of justice, and preserves the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shall you understand righteousness, and justice, and equity; yea, every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto your soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion shall preserve you, understanding shall keep you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaks perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Whose ways are crooked, and who are perverse in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver you from the immoral woman, even from the seductress who flatters with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Who forsakes the companion of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house leads unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the blameless shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them upon the table of your heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not unto your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in your own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It shall be health to your body, and strength to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gain from it is better than the gain from silver, and the profit thereof than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is everyone that retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>So shall they be life unto your soul, and grace to your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the ruin from the wicked, when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being snared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Say not unto your neighbor, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely he scorns the scornful: but he gives grace unto the lowly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was almost in utter ruin in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>He winks with his eyes, he signals with his feet, he motions with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil continually; he sows discord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.20'>My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:</verse>
