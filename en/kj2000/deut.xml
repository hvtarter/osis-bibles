        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelt long enough in this mount:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places near there, in the plain, in the hills, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their descendants after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more than you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone bear your weight, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>You shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said unto you, you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said unto you; fear not, neither be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And you came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of each tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>And you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God who goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And the LORD heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>But Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, who you said should be a prey, and your children, who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then you answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when you had girded on every man his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke unto you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So you abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that you abode there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke unto me: and we went around mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>You have gone around this mountain long enough: turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command the people, saying, You are to pass through the territory of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed unto yourselves therefore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as one footstep; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You shall buy food from them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we passed by away from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongeber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The Emim dwelt there in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>Who also were considered giants, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites also dwelt in Seir formerly; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, said the LORD, and get over the brookZered. And we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the time in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were perished from among the camp as the LORD swore unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were perished and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>That the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>You are to pass over through Ar, the boundary of Moab, this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when you come near the border of the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also was regarded as a land of giants: giants dwelt there formerly; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avvim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear reports of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we defeated him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbade us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do unto him as you did unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>The plain also, with the Jordan as the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are fit for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>Until the LORD has given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan: and then shall you return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms through which you pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>You shall not fear them: for the LORD your God, he shall fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that pleasant mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, That is sufficient; speak no more unto me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Get up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But you that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>Lest the land from which you brought us out should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</verse>
