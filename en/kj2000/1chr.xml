        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.1'>Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.2'>And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.3'>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the fittings; and bronze in abundance without weight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.4'>Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.5'>And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.6'>Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.7'>And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.8'>But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build a house unto my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.9'>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.10'>He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.11'>Now, my son, the LORD be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.12'>Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.13'>Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.14'>Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of bronze and iron beyond weighing; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.15'>Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.16'>Of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no limit. Arise therefore, and begin working, and the LORD be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.17'>David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.18'>Is not the LORD your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.19'>Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.23'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.1'>So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.2'>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.3'>Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.4'>Of which, twenty and four thousand were to look after the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.5'>Moreover four thousand were gatekeepers; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, for praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.6'>And David divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.7'>Of the Gershonites were, Ladan, and Shimei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.8'>The sons of Ladan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.9'>The sons of Shimei; Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Ladan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.10'>And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.11'>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, as one fatherâ€™s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.12'>The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.13'>The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to give the blessing in his name forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.14'>Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.15'>The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.16'>Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.17'>And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.18'>Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.19'>Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.20'>Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Issiah the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.21'>The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.22'>And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.23'>The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.24'>These were the sons of Levi by their fathersâ€™ houses; even the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, as they were counted individually by the number of their names, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.25'>For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.26'>And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.27'>For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.28'>Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.29'>Both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for meal offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is mixed with all kinds of measures and sizes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.30'>And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.31'>And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to that required of them, continually before the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.23.32'>And that they should attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, and the needs of the holy place, and the needs of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.24'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.1'>Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.2'>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priestâ€™s office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.3'>And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.4'>And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, and eight heads of their fathersâ€™ houses among the sons of Ithamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.5'>Thus were they divided by lot, one group as another; for the officials of the sanctuary, and officials of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.6'>And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the leaders, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the priests and Levites: one fatherâ€™s house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.19'>This was the schedule of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their procedure established under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.20'>And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.25'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.25.1'>Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with lyres, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.3'>But God said unto me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.4'>However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.5'>And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.9'>And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.10'>Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.11'>Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans of the vestibule, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place for the mercy seat,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.20'>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.21'>And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.1'>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the bronze for things of bronze, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistening stones, and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have of my own things, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of craftsmen. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses and the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the kingâ€™s work, offered willingly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.8'>And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>Then the people rejoiced, for they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Both riches and honor come from you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? for all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>I know also, my God, that you test the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, who are present here, to offer willingly unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their heart unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the next day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the prince, and Zadok to be priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>And all the leaders, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now the acts of David the king, from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>With all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, and to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
