        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us to glory and virtue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>By which are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>And for this reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>And to knowledge self control; and to self control patience; and to patience godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For so an entrance shall be provided unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>Yea, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my departure to have these things always in remembrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we have not followed cunningly devised myths, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; to which you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of oneâ€™s own interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who shall secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many shall follow their shameful ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And through covetousness shall they with false words exploit you: whose judgment of old now lingers not, and their destruction slumbers not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>And spared not the ancient world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them by a catastrophe, making them an example unto those that later should live ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy behavior of the wicked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise authority. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of the glorious ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, reveling themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>Who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb donkey speaking with man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that have just escaped from them who live in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog has turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>By which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But the heavens and the earth, which now are, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conduct and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>Looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable twist, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things beforehand, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.</verse>
