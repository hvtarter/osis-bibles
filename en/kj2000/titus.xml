        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of rebellion or unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not violent, not given to dishonest gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to refute the opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>Whose mouths must be stopped, who ruin whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>Not giving heed to Jewish myths, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But you speak the things which become sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>That the aged men be sensible, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>That they may teach the young women to be sensible, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Young men likewise exhort to be sensible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing incorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is an opponent may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not talking back;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>Not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live sensibly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Whom he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This is a faithful saying, and these things I desire that you affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A man that is divisive after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Knowing that he that is such is perverted, and sins, being condemned of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be lacking unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our own also learn to maintain good works for urgent needs, that they not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me greet you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
