        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>Mercy unto you, and peace and love, be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was necessary for me to write unto you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>And the angels who kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after unnatural lust, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of the glorious ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil as he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are spots in your love feasts, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about by winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, holding men in admiration for the sake of advantage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>And on some have compassion, making a difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>Now unto him who is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>To the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.</verse>
