        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>Neither give heed to myths and endless genealogies, which cause questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor the things they affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>For fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for an example to them who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit unto you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which were made concerning you, that you by them might war a good warfare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made it shipwreck:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>Who gave himself a ransom for all, this to be a testimony at the proper time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>To this I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with decency and propriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>But (as becomes women professing godliness) with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have authority over the man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>Yet she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with propriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This is a true saying, If a man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>Not given to wine, not violent, not greedy of money; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(For if a man knows not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have a good report of them who are outside; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of dishonest gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And let these also first be tested; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Even so must their wives be serious, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they that have used the office of a deacon well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things write I unto you, hoping to come unto you shortly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without doubt great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, which you have attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But refuse profane and old wives' tales, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise profits for a little while: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man despise your youth; but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your progress may appear to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety at home, and so repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And these things give in a charge, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let not a widow be put on the list under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>Well reported of for good works; if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they will marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>Having judgment, because they have cast off their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And at the same time they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but gossips also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some are already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any man or woman that believes has widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against an elder receive not an accusation, unless before two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Drink no longer water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men's sins are evident beforehand, going before them to judgment; and some men they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise also the good works of some are evident beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are believers and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting over questions and disputes of words, out of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>Perverse wranglings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>And having food and clothing let us be with these things content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I give you charge in the sight of God, who brings all things to life, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>That you keep this commandment without spot, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>Who in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge them that are rich in this present age, that they be not haughty, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to share;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain utterances, and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
