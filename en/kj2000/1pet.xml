        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In which you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold trials:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>But as he who has called you is holy, so be holy in all manner of conduct;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>Because it is written, You will be holy; for I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your exile here in fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>Since you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain manner of life received by tradition from your fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto sincere love of the brethren, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>To whom coming, as unto a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>You also, as living stones, are built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>Unto you therefore who believe he is precious: but unto them who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>And, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them who stumble at the word, being disobedient: to which also they were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Who in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as aliens and exiles, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Having your conduct honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is commendable, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is commendable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For even to this were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conduct of the wives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>While they behold your chaste behavior coupled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, be all of one mind, having compassion one with another, love as brethren, be tender hearted, be courteous:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary blessing; knowing that you are unto this called, that you should inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and, Be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good behavior in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>By whom also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>Who formerly were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, by which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>The like figure unto which even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Since therefore Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time past of our life will suffice us to have done the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in licentiousness, lusts, excess of wine, reveling, carousing, and abominable idolatries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In which they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of dissipation, speaking evil of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand: be therefore sober minded, and watch unto prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent love among yourselves: for love shall cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Practice hospitality one to another without grudging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As every man has received a gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But rejoice, since you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begins with us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for dishonest gain, but of a ready mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, restore, establish, strengthen, settle you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silas, a faithful brother unto you, as I regard, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
