        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>So that we ourselves boast of you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Therefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, that the day of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come the falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you know what restrains that he might be revealed in his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now restrains will do so, until he be taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then shall that Wicked One be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>And with all deception of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>That they all might be condemned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>To which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and has given us everlasting encouragement and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>Encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we have not that right, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle: so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
