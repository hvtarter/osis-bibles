        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you that which is required,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Who in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your consent would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him forever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that on my account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: nevertheless I do not say to you how you owe me even your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There greet you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
