        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto you a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry: for the land has committed great harlotry, departing from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, you are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, you are the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say you unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her harlotry out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip her naked, and make her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and make her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a wall, so that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I return, and take away my grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and will take back my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will punish her for the days of Baalim, when she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will abolish the bow and the sword and the battle from the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth you unto me forever; yea, I will betroth you unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth you unto me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, says the LORD, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>And the earth shall answer with grain, and wine, and oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her for myself in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them who were not my people, you are my people; and they shall say, you are my God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her lover, and an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said unto her, you shall abide with me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of the LORD, you children of Israel: for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land: Because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break all restraint, and bloodshed touches bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fish of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your people are as they that strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me: because you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them for their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase: because they have ceased to obey the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Harlotry and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel of their idols of wood, and their staff advises unto them: for the spirit of harlotry has caused them to err, and they have played the harlot against their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because its shadow is good: therefore your daughters shall commit harlotry, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for the men themselves are gone apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: therefore the people that do not understand shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not unto Gilgal, neither go up to Bethaven, nor swear, As the LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel slides back like a stubborn heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in an open pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink is sour: they have committed harlotry continually: her rulers love shame more than glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear you this, O priests; and hearken, you house of Israel; and give you ear, O house of the king; for judgment is for you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And the revolters are deeply involved in slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, you commit harlotry, and Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>They will not change their deeds to turn unto their God: for the spirit of harlotry is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten pagan children: now a new moon shall devour them with their heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, beware, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the landmark: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after a human commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore will I be unto Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear them and go away; I will take them away, and none shall rescue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Let us know, let us press on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto you? O Judah, what shall I do unto you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore have I hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is defiled with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as bands of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the harlotry of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, O Judah, he has appointed a harvest for you, when I return the captives of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief comes in, and bands of robbers plunder outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own deeds have surrounded them; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceases to stir the fire after he has kneaded the dough, until it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings have fallen: there is none among them that calls unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knows not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without sense: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they wailed upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and wine, and they rebel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise evil against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not to the most High: they are like a treacherous bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the insolence of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle over the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Your calf, O Samaria, has cast you off; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be before they attain to innocence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel is even this: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: the stalk has no bud: it shall yield no meal: if so be it does yield, the aliens shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which is no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey alone by itself: Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little because of the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin offerings, the altars shall be unto him for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and punish their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his palaces.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for you have played the harlot against your God, you have loved for hire upon every threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them like the bread of mourners; all that eat of it shall be defiled: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the precious things of their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of punishment have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, because of the multitude of your iniquity, and the great hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will punish their sins.</verse>
