        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>I am dark, but lovely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the sun has darkened me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed, where you make your flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turns aside by the flocks of your companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth in the footsteps of the flock, and feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.1'>I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.2'>As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.3'>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag: behold, he stands behind our wall, he looks forth through the windows, showing himself through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.12'>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>The fig tree puts forth its green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is lovely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Catch us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds his flock among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.3'>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.1'>By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.2'>I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw you him whom my soul loves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>It was but a little after I passed by them, when I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till it pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.6'>Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves' eyes behind your veil: your hair is like a flock of goats, going down from mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; every one of which bears twins, and none is barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, and your mouth is lovely: your temples are like a piece of pomegranate behind your veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand shields, all shields of mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.5'>Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away, I will go up to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one look of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How fair is your love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is your love than wine! and the fragrance of your perfume than all spices!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Your lips, O my spouse, drop like the honeycomb: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; henna, with spikenard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.15'>A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.16'>Awake, O north wind; and come, you south; blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat its pleasant fruits.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I have come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my robe; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how could I soil them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.4'>My beloved put in his hand by the latch of the door, and my heart was thrilled for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen that went about the city found me, they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him, that I am sick with love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>What is your beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? what is your beloved more than another beloved, that you so charge us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.10'>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.11'>His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are wavy, and black as a raven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.12'>His eyes are like doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks are like a bed of spices, like sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dripping sweet smelling myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His arms are as rounded gold set with beryl: his body is as carved ivory overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are pillars of marble, set upon bases of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.16'>His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.6'>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.1'>Where has your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? where has your beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.2'>My beloved has gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.3'>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feeds his flock among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.4'>You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.5'>Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats going down from Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.6'>Your teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.7'>As a piece of a pomegranate are your temples behind your veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.8'>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove, my perfect one, is the only one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the favorite one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the blossoms of the valley, and to see whether the vine had budded, and the pomegranates were in bloom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Before I was aware, my desire had made me as the chariots of my noble people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon you. Why will you look upon the Shulamite? As upon a dance before two armies?.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! the curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful craftsman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Your navel is like a round goblet, which lacks not blended drink: your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the pools of Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Your head crowns you like Carmel, and the hair of your head is like purple; the king is held captive by your tresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.6'>How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for your delights!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>This your stature is like to a palm tree, and your breasts to its clusters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its branches: may also your breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your breath like apples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, flowing gently over lips and teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine has budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened, and the pomegranates are in bloom: there will I give you my loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes give a fragrance, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>O that you were as my brother, that nursed at the breasts of my mother! if I should find you outside, I would kiss you; yea, I would not be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead you, and bring you into my mother's house, who had instructed me: I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.3'>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.4'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, until it pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.5'>Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree: there your mother brought you forth: there she brought you forth that bore you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm: for love is as strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: its flames are flames of fire, a most vehement flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, it would utterly be rejected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she is a wall, we will build upon her towers of silver: and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.10'>I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.11'>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; everyone for its fruit was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.12'>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that tend its fruit two hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.13'>You that dwell in the gardens, the companions listen for your voice: let me hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.14'>Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of spices.</verse>
