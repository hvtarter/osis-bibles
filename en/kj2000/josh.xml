        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but you shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the LORD has given your brethren rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them: then you shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan toward the sun rising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us, we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto you: only the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whosoever he be that does rebel against your commandment, and will not hearken unto your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into a harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you, who are entered into your house: for they are come to search out all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I know not from where they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you shall overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued after them by the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true sign:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>And that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a rope through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless concerning this your oath which you have made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all your father's household, home unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if you utter this our business, then we will be free of your oath which you have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they set out from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall set out from your place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you are come to the edge of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people set out from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as they that bore the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water, (for Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far at the city Adam, that is beside Zarethan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right opposite Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed completely over Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the people were completely passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke unto Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command them, saying, Take from here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then you shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hastened and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people were completely passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the LORD spoke unto Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you might fear the LORD your God forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the reason why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they did eat of the old grain of the land the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched grain on the very same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased the next day after they had eaten of the old grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, are you for us, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, Nay; but as captain of the army of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What says my lord unto his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of the LORD'S army said unto Joshua, Loose your shoes from off your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And you shall march around the city, all you men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said unto the people, Pass on, and march around the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, you shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the ark of the LORD circled the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they marched around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>And you, by all means keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burned the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua charged them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof with his firstborn, and with his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; and make not all the people to toil up there; for they are but few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai struck of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and struck them on the descent: therefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side of Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get you up; why do you lie thus upon your face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and deceived also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, unless you destroy the accursed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctifyyourselves for tomorrow: for thus says the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel: you can not stand before your enemies, until you take away the accursed thing from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I have done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall you take for a prey unto yourselves: lay you an ambush for the city behind it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be you all ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>Then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall you do. See, I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and camped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and those lying in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the others came out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>And Joshua burned Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise on it a great heap of stones, that remains unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were living among them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Therefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may attack Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Joshua said unto the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If you forsake the LORD, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after that he has done you good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said unto the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest you deny your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.30'>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that belonged to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</verse>
