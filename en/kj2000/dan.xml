        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Dan'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's descendants, and of the princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Young men in whom was no blemish, but handsome, and skilful in all wisdom, and gifted in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so training them three years, that at the end of that time they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into favor and kindness with the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the young men who are of your age? then shall you make me endanger my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Test your servants, I beseech you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the countenance of the young men that eat of the portion of the king's food: and as you see fit, deal with your servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he consented to them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who did eat the portion of the king's food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, by which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic, O king, live forever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known unto me the dream, with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if you show the dream, and its interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if you will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can tell the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is none other that can reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank you, and praise you, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has made known unto me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known unto us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, are you able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers, cannot show unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, are these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its form was frightening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>Its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>You saw till a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And as you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it the strength of the iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And as you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the descendants of men: but they shall not hold one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Just as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and incense unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and its width six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the administrators, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the satraps, the administrators, and governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>That at what time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whosoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And whosoever falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if you are ready that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the satraps, administrators, and governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats affected, nor had the smell of fire come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, who speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap: because there is no other God that can deliver in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the most high God has worked for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and its sight to the end of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher, a holy one came down from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him: and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowliest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or its interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be for them that hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and its sight to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>Whose leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>It is you, O king, that have grown and become strong: for your greatness has grown, and reached unto heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And since the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And since they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure unto you, after you shall have known that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you, and break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken; The kingdom has departed from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair had grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives forever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can restrain his hand, or say unto him, What do you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned unto me; and my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, might drink from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.3'>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, drank from them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>Because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and solving of riddles, and explaining of problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.13'>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Are you that Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; because he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.6'>Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the satraps, the counselors, and the advisors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>Therefore king Darius signed the written decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; have you not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>Then the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.16'>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.17'>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieved voice unto Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: because before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.23'>Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.24'>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came at the bottom of the den.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.25'>Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.26'>I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.27'>He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till the thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and its wheels as burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>And of the ten horns that were on its head, and of the other which came up, and before which three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was greater than its fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the court shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with rage against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>Therefore the male goat grew very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it grew great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And a host was given him to oppose the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it did this, and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint who spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said unto me, For two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'>And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: that for the time of the end shall be the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.20'>The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.21'>And the male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.22'>As for that horn being broken, and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of that nation, but not with its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to their fullness, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy awesomely, and shall prosper, and thrive, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>And through his cunning also he shall cause deceit to prosper under his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and without warning shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken, by no human hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: therefore shut up the vision; for it shall be many days hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.9'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the descendants of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'>In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood from the books the number of the years, of which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'>And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'>Neither have we hearkened unto your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.7'>O Lord, righteousness belongs unto you, but unto us shame of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.8'>O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.9'>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.10'>Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.11'>Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'>And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.13'>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.14'>Therefore has the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.15'>And now, O Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and has gotten yourself renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.16'>O Lord, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all that are about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.17'>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.18'>O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.19'>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.20'>And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.21'>Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.22'>And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.24'>Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah, the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'>And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.10'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'>I ate no pleasant food, neither came meat nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished bronze, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great trembling fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my vigor was turned in me into ruin, and I retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And, behold, a hand touched me, which made me tremble upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto you, and stand upright: for unto you am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; for I had remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.14'>Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for the vision is for many days yet to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.15'>And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'>And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, because of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.18'>Then there came again and touched me one having the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.19'>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto you, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.20'>Then said he, Know you why I come unto you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I have gone forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.21'>But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that upholds me in these things, but Michael your prince.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.1'>Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.2'>And now will I show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than them all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.3'>And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.4'>And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.5'>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.6'>And at the end of some years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of her authority; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.7'>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.8'>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.9'>So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.10'>But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.11'>And the king of the south shall be moved with rage, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.12'>And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.13'>For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much equipment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.14'>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the violent men of your people shall exalt themselves to fulfill the vision; but they shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.15'>So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a siege mound, and take the most fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not withstand, neither his choice troops, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.16'>But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.17'>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to destroy it: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.18'>After this shall he turn his face unto the coastlands, and shall take many: but a ruler for his own behalf shall bring the reproach brought by him to cease; with his reproach removed he shall cause it to turn back on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.19'>Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.20'>Then shall arise in his place a raiser of taxes in the glorious kingdom: but within a few days he shall be destroyed, but neither in anger, nor in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.21'>And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of royalty: but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by flatteries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.25'>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall devise plans against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.26'>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his rich food shall destroy him, and his army shall be swept away: and many shall fall down slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.27'>And both these kings' hearts shall be to do evil, and they shall speak lies at the same table; but it shall not prosper: for the end shall yet be at the time appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.28'>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; but his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall work his will, and return to his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.29'>At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be like the former, or like the latter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.30'>For the ships of Kittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and rage against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and show favor toward them that forsake the holy covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.31'>And forces shall appear on his part, and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.32'>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flattery: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and take action.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.33'>And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by plunder, many days.</verse>
