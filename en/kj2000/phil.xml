        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>Being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>Even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; since as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the affections of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I wish you to understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have served rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And many of the brethren in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The one preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? only that, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only let your manner of life be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not a thing to be grasped to be equal with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmuring and disputing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him therefore I hope to send presently, as soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because you had heard that he had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick near unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I sent him therefore the more eagerly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in honor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>Because for the work of Christ he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not troublesome, but for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has reasons he might trust in the flesh, I more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but rubbish, that I may win Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if indeed I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us therefore, as many as would be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, to what we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them who so walk, since you have us for an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship is in heaven; from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who shall change our humble body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I urge Euodias, and urge Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I entreat you also, true yokefellow, help those women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other of my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; in which you were also concerned, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well, that you did share in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
