        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great distress and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>But if you turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though some of you were cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the kingâ€™s cupbearer.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had never been sad before in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>Therefore the king said unto me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And said unto the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said unto me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, that I may rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may let me pass over till I come into Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the kingâ€™s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which pertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the temple that I shall enter into. And the king so granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the kingâ€™s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even to the jackalâ€™s well, and to the refuse gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down; and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the kingâ€™s pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then said I unto them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we are no more a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the kingâ€™s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed at us, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And next unto him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.4'>And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.5'>And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.6'>Moreover the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.7'>And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, who were under the authority of the governor on this side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.8'>Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the perfumers, and they restored Jerusalem unto the broad wall.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.12'>And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.13'>The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the refuse gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>But the refuse gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the kingâ€™s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half district of Beth-zur, unto the place opposite the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was man made, and unto the house of the mighty men.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry, and felt great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they finish in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox goes up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a spoil in a land of captivity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you: for they have provoked you to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, and that the breaks began to be closed, then they were very angry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is failing, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt near them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places where you shall return unto us they will be upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people according to their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone unto his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the armor; and the rulers supported all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, so burdened themselves, everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>For the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In whatever place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet, come you there unto us: our God shall fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor during the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were those that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore let us get grain for them, that we may eat, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy grain, because of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also those that said, We have borrowed money for the kingâ€™s tax, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, you exact interest, every one from his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold unto the nations; and will you even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, It is not good what you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, are lending them money and grain: I pray you, let us stop this charging interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the food allowance of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors that had been before me laid burdens upon the people, and had taken of them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there unto the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that are about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days abundant stores of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the food allowance of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no break left in it; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>Yet they sent unto me four times in this way; and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>In it was written, It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you invent them out of your own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yea, in the night will they come to slay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>My God, think you upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was done by our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God more than many.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>Now the city was large and great: but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.28'>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore you left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.29'>And testified against them, that you might bring them again unto your law: yet they acted presumptuously, and hearkened not unto your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man does, he shall live in them;) and turned the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I made treasurers over the storehouse, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their duty was to distribute unto their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; and also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them about the day in which they sold provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>There dwelt men of Tyre also there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge you before the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the language of Judah, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and pronounced them cursed, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and assigned the duties of the priests and the Levites, each one to his service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>And provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</verse>
