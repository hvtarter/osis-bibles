        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>And all the brethren who are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God our Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now seek the favor of men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And advanced in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But other of the apostles saw I none, except James the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>And because of false brethren brought in unawares, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>To whom we yielded in subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But of these who seemed to be somebody, (whatsoever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somebody in conference added nothing to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain men came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews joined likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not nullify the grace of God: for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been openly set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know you therefore that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his descendant were the promises made. He says not, And to descendants, as of many; but as of one, And to your descendant, who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the descendant should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture has consigned all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But after faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christ's, then are you Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But then, when you knew not God, you did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, after you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You observe days, and months, and times, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as you are: you have not injured me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know how through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my trial which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you witness, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are zealous of you, but not for good; yea, they would exclude you, that you might be zealous of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealous always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I stand in doubt of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, which brings forth to bondage, which is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will not be otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I would they were even cut off who trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For, brethren, you have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, impurity, licentiousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strife, jealousy, wrath, selfishness, divisions, heresies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you beforehand, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Meekness, self-control: against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him that is taught in the word share with him that teaches in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>You see with what large letters I have written unto you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
