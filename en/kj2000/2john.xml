        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked for, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever goes beyond, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
