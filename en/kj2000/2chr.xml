        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought the LORD there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said unto God, You have shown great mercy unto David my father, and have made me to reign in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O LORD God, let your promise unto David my father be established: for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that are so great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of your enemies, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>Wisdom and knowledge are granted unto you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plentiful as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and Kue: the kingâ€™s merchants received them from Kue at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they acquired and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by the merchants.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon selected threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to quarry in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, even so deal with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I build will be great: for great is our God above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, except only to burn sacrifices before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that has skill to engrave with the skillful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderfully great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And, behold, I will give to your servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, and twenty thousand cors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved his people, he has made you king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, Huramabi,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to execute every design which shall be given to him, with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, according to the census by which David his father had numbered them; and there were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to quarry in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to make the people work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these are the things in which Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits according to the old cubit was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the vestibule that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it inside with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater room he lined with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he adorned the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He lined also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and carved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy place, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And in the most holy place he made two cherubim of wood, and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>Also he made in front of the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he raised up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>Moreover he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape, and five cubits its height; and a line of thirty cubits did measure its circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did circle it round about: ten to a cubit, circling the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them, and all their hind parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; and it received and held three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>The two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>And four hundred pomegranates on the two networks; two rows of pomegranates on each net, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He made also stands, and lavers made he upon the stands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their articles, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Thus Solomon made all these articles in great abundance: for the weight of the bronze could not be measured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the articles that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the showbread was set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>Moreover the lampstands with their lamps, that they should burn in the prescribed manner before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, the purest gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entrance of the house, the inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the furnishings, put he in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, to the inner sanctuary of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And the poles of the ark extended out, so that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside. And there it is unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, without regard to their divisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and lyres and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures forever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then said Solomon, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>But I have built a house of habitation for you, and a place for your dwelling forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the LORD said to David my father, Since it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well in that it was in your heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>The LORD therefore has performed his word that he has spoken: for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And in it have I put the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven, nor in the earth; who keeps covenant, and shows mercy unto your servants, that walk before you with all their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>You who have kept with your servant David my father that which you have promised him; and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; if only your children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you have walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you have spoken unto your servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>That your eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to hearken unto the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>Hearken therefore unto the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>If a man sins against his neighbor, and is made to take an oath, and the oath is made before your altar in this house;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.23'>And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he procured many wives for them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.1'>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.3'>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Libyans, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.4'>And he took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.5'>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus says the LORD, You have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.6'>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.7'>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>In place of them king Rehoboam made shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the entrance of the kingâ€™s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and bore them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his motherâ€™s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.16'>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made yourselves priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their service:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>And, behold, God himself is with us as our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight not against the LORD God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>But Jeroboam sent an ambush to come around behind them: so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.15'>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>For he took away the altars of the foreign gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the idol poles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars: and the kingdom was quiet under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army of men that bore large shields and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his army; and they carried away very much plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.14'>And they defeated all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was very much plunder in them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.6'>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.7'>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they dedicate to Baalim.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.12'>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.4'>But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.5'>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to their fathersâ€™ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.6'>He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.15'>And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.16'>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.17'>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.19'>His prayer also, and how God received his entreaty, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up idol poles and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.20'>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.21'>Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.23'>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.24'>And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.25'>But the people of the land killed all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.1'>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.2'>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the idol poles, and the carved images, and the molten images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the idol poles, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and scattered it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.5'>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.6'>And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.7'>And when he had broken down the altars and the idol poles, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.8'>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.10'>And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and restore the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.11'>Even to the craftsmen and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for beams, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.12'>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight; and other of the Levites, all that were skillful with instruments of music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.13'>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that did the work in any kind of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.14'>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.16'>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.17'>And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.18'>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.19'>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.20'>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter:) and they spoke to her to that effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she answered them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall you say unto him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which you have heard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>Because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbled yourself before me, and did tear your clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard you also, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon its inhabitants. So they brought the king word again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the country that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>And he set the priests in their duties, and encouraged them for the service of the house of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall no longer be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>And prepare yourselves according to your fathersâ€™ houses, according to your divisions, according to the writings of David king of Israel, and according to the writings of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathersâ€™ houses of your brethren the lay people, and according to the division of the families of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>And Josiah gave to the people, from the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the kingâ€™s possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the kingâ€™s commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites skinned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them quickly among all the lay people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy in the offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s seer; and the gatekeepers waited at every gate; they did not need to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war: for God commanded me to make haste: cease from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroys you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away; for I am badly wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.2'>Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>And the king of Egypt dethroned him at Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.6'>Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.7'>Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the articles of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.8'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.9'>Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.10'>And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the costly articles from the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>Moreover all the leaders of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much according to all the abominations of the nations; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>And the LORD God of their fathers sent word to them by his messengers, sending them time and again; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that was stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its costly possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.20'>And those that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.21'>To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has the LORD God of heaven given me; and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
