        <description> The King James 2000 is not a new version. It is a King James Version brought
  forward 400 years. Several categories of words are brought up to 21st century
  language. Pronouns such as thy, thine, thou, ye, etc. are put into current
  language usage form. Verbal endings such as -eth, -est, -st, etc. are given
  equivalent forms of today’s language. Words so archaic as to be unknown, such
  as wist, wot, froward, etc. are rendered as their current synonyms. Some
  words considered entirely proper in 1611, but which may be considered
  »coarse« today, are changed to equivalent intentions (such as bowels to
  heart). The common Biblical beast of burden is rendered donkey.</description>

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatsoever you do for the brethren, and for strangers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have borne witness of your love before the church: whom if you send forward on their journey in a godly manner, you shall do well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, speaking against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear witness; and you know that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
