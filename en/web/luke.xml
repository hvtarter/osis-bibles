  <div osisID='Luke' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Because many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now it happened, while he executed the priest`s office before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priest`s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, "Don`t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother`s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, `to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,` and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn`t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he delayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin`s name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>Having come in to her, the angel said, "Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>The angel said to her, "Don`t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give to him the throne of his father, David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end of his kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, seeing I am a virgin?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one which is born from you will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For no word from God will be void of power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word."     The angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary`s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he who is mighty has done to me great things; Holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear       him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down princes from their thrones. Has exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember       mercy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(As he spoke to our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."     They all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, For he has visited and worked redemption for his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>Has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his       servant David</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>(As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been       from of old),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To show mercy towards our fathers, To remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our       enemies, should serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our       life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, For you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of       their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew, and grew strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>The angel said to them, "Don`t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory to God in the highest, On earth peace, good will toward men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let`s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the feeding trough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord`s Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Now let you your servant depart, Lord, According to your word, in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light for revelation to the Gentiles, The glory of your people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn`t depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>The child grew, and grew strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy, Jesus, stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn`t know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day`s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>When they didn`t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>It happened, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn`t you know that I must be in my Father`s house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>They didn`t understand the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>He went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance to remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, And the rough ways smooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>All flesh will see God`s salvation.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don`t begin to say among yourselves, `We have Abraham for our father;` for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn`t bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>He said to them, "Extort no more than that which is appointed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we do?"     He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother`s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the sky was opened,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon`s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus` knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were  James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don`t be afraid. From now on you will catch men alive."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>He stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean."     Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>He charged him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Seeing their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier to say, `Your sins are forgiven you;` or to say, `Arise and walk?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>He left everything, and rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi made him a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>They said to him, "Why do John`s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then will they fast in those days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, `The old is better.`"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>It also happened on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>He looked around at them all, and said to him, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>It happened in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears, and doesn`t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>A certain centurion`s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, don`t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore I didn`t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, `Go!` and he goes; and to another, `Come!` and he comes; and to my servant, `Do this,` and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, "I tell you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples went with him, along with a great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "Don`t cry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. He gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Fear took hold on all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us," and, "God has visited his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>The disciples of John told him about all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, `Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>Blessed is he who is not offended by me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When John`s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings` courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written, `Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they justified God, being baptized with John`s baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>The Lord said, "To what then will I liken the men of this generation? What are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, `We piped to you, and you didn`t dance. We mourned, and you didn`t weep.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, `He has a demon.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>Wisdom is justified by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee`s house, and sat at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee`s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."     He said, "Teacher, say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>"A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>When they couldn`t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most."     He said to him, "You have judged correctly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You didn`t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod`s steward, Susanna; and many others; who ministered to them from their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell by the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that `seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, and fall away in time of temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn`t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>It was told him by some saying, "Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let`s go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>They came to him, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city met him, who had demons for a long time. He wore no clothes, and didn`t live in a house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don`t torment me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"     He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>They begged him who he would not command them to go into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>It happened, as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus` feet, and begged him to come into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus said, "Who touched me?"     When all denied, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, `Who touched me?`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>He said to her, "Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue`s house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don`t trouble the Teacher."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don`t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When he came to the house, he didn`t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the girl, and her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>All were weeping, and mourning her, but he said, "Don`t weep. She isn`t dead, but sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, "Little girl, arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had been done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey -- neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.     He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get provisions, for we are here in a desert place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, "You give them something to eat."     They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For they were about five thousand men.     He said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>It happened, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, "`John the Baptizer,` but others say, `Elijah,` and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"     Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of himself, of the Father, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>Behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let`s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they didn`t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn`t follow with us."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>They didn`t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them, "You don`t know what kind of spirit you are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of Man didn`t come to destroy men`s lives, but to save them."     They went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>He said to another, "Follow me."     But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>He went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>"If you are the Christ, tell us."     But he said to them, "If I tell you, you won`t believe,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>When he found out that he was in Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>Pilate adjudged that what they asked for should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don`t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, `Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then will they begin to tell the mountains, `Fall on us!` and to the hills, `Cover us.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don`t know what they are doing."     Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don`t you even fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>He said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood far away, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no man had ever yet lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>They entered in, and didn`t find the Lord Jesus` body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.     They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He isn`t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>They remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn`t believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only one travelling in Jerusalem who doesn`t know the things which have happened there in these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>He said to them, "What things?"     They said to him, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they didn`t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn`t see him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Didn`t the Christ have to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over."     He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>It happened, when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>They said one to another, "Wasn`t our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the scriptures to us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>They rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>As they said these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do questionings arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn`t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While they still didn`t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>He took it, and ate in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>He led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
