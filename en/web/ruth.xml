      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>Elimelech, Naomi`s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother`s house: Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh is gone forth against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>They lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god: return you after your sister-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>Ruth said, "Don`t entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>She said to them, "Don`t call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>Naomi had a kinsman of her husband`s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. She said to her, Go, my daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you. They answered him, Yahweh bless you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don`t you hear, my daughter? Don`t go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven`t I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>Boaz answered her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn`t know before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>At meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don`t reproach her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don`t rebuke her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man`s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>Now isn`t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don`t make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>She said to her, All that you say I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>He said, Who are you? She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>He said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn`t follow young men, whether poor or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>Now, my daughter, don`t be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman`s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>She lay at his feet until the morning. She rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? She told her all that the man had done to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said, "Don`t go empty to your mother-in-law."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. They sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech`s:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>The near kinsman said, I can`t redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: take my right of redemption on you; for I can`t redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech`s, and all that was Chilion`s and Mahlon`s, of the hand of Naomi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.</verse>
