      <chapter osisID='Prov.1'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction;    To discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive instruction in wise dealing,    In righteousness, justice, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give prudence to the simple,    Knowledge and discretion to the young man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;    That the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and parables,    The words and riddles of the wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;    But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, listen to your father`s instruction,    And don`t forsake your mother`s teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they will be a garland to grace your head,    And chains around your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, don`t consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, "Come with us,    Let`s lay in wait for blood;    Let`s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let`s swallow them up alive like Sheol,    And whole, like those who go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We`ll find all valuable wealth.    We`ll fill our houses with spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>You shall cast your lot among us.    We`ll all have one purse."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, don`t walk in the way with them.    Keep your foot from their path,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil.    They hurry to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>These lay wait for their own blood.    They lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain.    It takes away the life of its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom calls aloud in the street.    She utters her voice in the public squares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She calls at the head of noisy places.    At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,    And fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn at my reproof.    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.    I will make known my words to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you have refused;    I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But you have ignored all my counsel,    And wanted none of my reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your disaster.    I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When calamity overtakes you like a storm,    When your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;    When distress and anguish come on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge,    And didn`t choose the fear of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They wanted none of my counsel.    They despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,    And be filled with their own schemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.    The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,    And will be at ease, without fear of harm."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words,    And store up my commandments within you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So as to turn your ear to wisdom,    And apply your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yes, if you call out for discernment,    And lift up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If you seek her as silver,    And search for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,    And find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For Yahweh gives wisdom.    Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.    He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>That he may guard the paths of justice,    And preserve the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you will understand righteousness and justice,    Equity and every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom will enter into your heart.    Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion will watch over you.    Understanding will keep you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver you from the way of evil,    From the men who speak perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who forsake the paths of uprightness,    To walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil,    And delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Who are crooked in their ways,    And wayward in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver you from the strange woman,    Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Who forsakes the friend of her youth,    And forgets the covenant of her God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house leads down to death,    Her paths to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None who go to her return again,    Neither do they attain to the paths of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That you may walk in the way of good men,    And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright will dwell in the land.    The perfect will remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked will be cut off from the land.    The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, don`t forget my teaching;    But let your heart keep my commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days, and years of life,    And peace, will they add to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Don`t let kindness and truth forsake you.    Bind them around your neck.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God       and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,    And don`t lean on your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him,    And he will direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Don`t be wise in your own eyes.    Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be health to your body,    And nourishment to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor Yahweh with your substance,    With the first fruits of all your increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So your barns will be filled with plenty,    And your vats will overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, don`t despise Yahweh`s discipline,    Neither be weary of his reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;    Even as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,    The man who gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,    The profit of it better than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies.    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand.    In her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness.    All her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.    Happy is everyone who retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.    By understanding, he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,    And the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>So they will be life to your soul,    And grace for your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then you shall walk in your way securely.    Your foot won`t stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you will not be afraid.    Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Don`t be afraid of sudden fear,    Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For Yahweh will be your confidence,    And will keep your foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Don`t withhold good from those to whom it is due,    When it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Don`t say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again,    Tomorrow I will give,"    When you have it by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Don`t devise evil against your neighbor,    Seeing he dwells securely by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Don`t strive with a man without cause,    If he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Don`t envy the man of violence.    Choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,    But his friendship is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked,    But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely he mocks the mockers,    But he gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise will inherit glory,    But shame will be the promotion of fools.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Listen, sons, to a father`s instruction.    Pay attention and know understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you sound learning.    Don`t forsake my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was a son to my father,    Tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>He taught me, and said to me:    "Let your heart retain my words.    Keep my commandments, and live.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they don`t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness,    And drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,    That shines more and more until the perfect day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, pay attention to my wisdom.    Turn your ear to my understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>That you may maintain discretion,    That your lips may preserve knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.    Her mouth is smoother than oil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,    And as sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death.    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>She gives no thought to the way of life.    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn`t know it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.3'>Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,    Seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself.    Press your plea with your neighbor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.10'>A little sleep, a little slumber,    A little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.11'>So your poverty will come as a robber,    And your scarcity as an armed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A worthless person, a man of iniquity,    Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,    Who motions with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>In whose heart is perverseness,    Who devises evil continually,    Who always sows discord.</verse>
