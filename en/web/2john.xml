        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth`s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don`t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Watch yourselves, that we don`t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever transgresses and doesn`t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn`t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you, and doesn`t bring this teaching, don`t receive him into your house, and don`t welcome him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I don`t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
