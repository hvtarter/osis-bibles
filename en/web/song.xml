        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Don`t stare at me because I am dark,    Because the sun has scorched me. My mother`s sons were angry with me.    They made me keeper of the vineyards.    I haven`t kept my own vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, you whom my soul loves,    Where you graze your flock,    Where you rest them at noon;    For why should I be as one who is veiled    Beside the flocks of your companions?  Lover</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>I had scarcely passed from them,    When I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go,    Until I had brought him into my mother`s house,    Into the chamber of her who conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,    That you not stir up, nor awaken love,    Until it so desires.</verse>
