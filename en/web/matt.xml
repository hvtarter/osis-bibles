      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse became the father of David the king. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor became the father of Sadoc. Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; because when his mother, Mary, had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, you son of David, don`t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name JESUS, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a       son. They shall call his name Immanuel;"      which is, being interpreted, "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and didn`t know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod, the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>"Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>`You Bethlehem, land of Judah, Are in no way least among the princes of Judah: For out of you shall come forth a governor, Who shall shepherd my people, Israel`".</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>Being warned in a dream that they shouldn`t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem, and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; She wouldn`t be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child`s life are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John himself had clothing made of camel`s hair, and a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Don`t think to yourselves, `We have Abraham for our father,` for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn`t bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered, "It is written, `Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,  `He will give his angels charge concerning you.`     and, `On their hands they will bear you up, So that you don`t dash your foot against a stone.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, `You shall not test the Lord, your God.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>He said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, `You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness saw a great light, To those who sat in the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>He said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers for men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They immediately left their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with Zebedee, their father, mending their nets. He called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>The report about him went forth into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto a mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of       Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>"Blessed are the humble, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for       they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of       God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness`       sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and       say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>"Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, what will it be salted with? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill can`t be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a bushel basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Don`t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn`t come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For most assuredly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to them of old time, `You shall not murder;` and `Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, `Raca,` shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, `You fool,` shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Most assuredly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall not commit adultery;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"It was also said, `Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I tell you that whoever who puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever shall marry her when she is put away commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, `You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I tell you, don`t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can`t make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your speech be, `Yes, yes; No, no.` Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it was said, `An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you, don`t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>If any man would go to law with you and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asks you, and don`t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don`t sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most assuredly, I tell you, they have received their reward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip`s wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>saying, "Teacher, Moses said, `If a man dies, having no children, his brother will marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven`t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>`I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?` God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said to him, "`You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>A second likewise is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?"     They said to him, "Of David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you always have the poor with you; but you don`t always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in that she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Most assuredly I tell you, wherever this gospel will be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, "What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, `The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>As they were eating, he said, "Most assuredly I tell you, that one of you will betray me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn`t me, is it, Lord?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn`t me, is it, Rabbi?"     He said to him, "So you have said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "Drink all of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father`s kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be offended by me tonight, for it is written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be offended by you, I will never be offended."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, that tonight, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I want, but what you want."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, couldn`t you watch with me for one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that you don`t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup can`t pass away from me, unless I drink it, your will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Take him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I can`t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn`t arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."     Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This man said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The high priest stood up, and answered him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?"     They answered, "He is worthy of death!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before them all, saying, "I don`t know what you are talking about."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Again he denied with an oath, "I don`t know the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then began he to curse and to swear, "I don`t know the man!"     Immediately the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."     But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>They took counsel, and bought with them the potter`s field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom some of the children of Israel did price,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter`s field, as the Lord commanded me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     Jesus said to him, "So you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, "Don`t you hear how many things they testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governor used to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"     They said, "Barabbas!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "What then will I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?"     They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>But the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So when Pilate saw that nothing was gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the governor`s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>and they sat and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>They set up over his head his accusation written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>"He saved others, but he can`t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God. Let him deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, `I am the Son of God.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man calls Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to save him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus` disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the next day, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: `After three days I will rise again.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, `He is risen from the dead;` and the last deception will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went, and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel answered the women, "Don`t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Go quickly and tell his disciples, `He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.` Behold, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"     They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Don`t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>If this comes to the governor`s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</verse>
