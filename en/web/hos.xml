      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution; for the land does commit great prostitution, [departing] from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>Yahweh said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>It shall happen at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>She conceived again, and bore a daughter. [Yahweh] said to him, Call her name Look-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Look-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>[Yahweh] said, Call his name Look-ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be your [God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which can`t be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, it shall be said to them, [You are] the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>The children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say you to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>Yes, on her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of prostitution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>for their mother has played the prostitute; she who conceived them has done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>She shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I take back my grain in the time of it, and my new wine in the season of it, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>Now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she has said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the animals of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>I will visit on her the days of the Baals, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>It shall be at that day, says Yahweh, that you shall call me Ishi, and shall call me no more Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>In that day will I make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>I will betroth you to me forever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>It shall happen in that day, I will answer, says Yahweh, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; and I will tell those who were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, [You are] my God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Yahweh said to me, Go again, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>and I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be any man`s wife: so will I also be toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear to Yahweh and to his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel; for Yahweh has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>There is nothing but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood touches blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore shall the land mourn, and everyone who dwells therein shall languish, with the animals of the field and the birds of the sky; yes, the fish of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for your people are as those who strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>You shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you in the night; and I will destroy your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>It shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>They shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the prostitute, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them; for the spirit of prostitution has caused them to err, and they have played the prostitute, [departing] from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow of it is good: therefore your daughters play the prostitute, and your brides commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that does not understand shall be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, yet don`t let Judah offend; and don`t you come to Gilgal, neither go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Yahweh lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Yahweh feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink is become sour; they play the prostitute continually; her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, you priests, and listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king; for to you pertains the judgment; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>The rebels have gone deep in making slaughter; but I discipline them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don`t know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>The pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they shall not find him: he has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against Yahweh; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind you, Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after [man`s] command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore am I to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Let us know, let us follow on to know Yahweh: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>Ephraim, what shall I do to you? Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are [as] the light that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>As troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yes, they have committed lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there prostitution is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I bring back the captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the troop of robbers ravages outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>They don`t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceases to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them who calls to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn`t know [it]: yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he doesn`t know [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>The pride of Israel does testify to his face: yet they have not returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they shall go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the birds of the sky; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them! for they have wandered from me; destruction to them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>They have not cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not to [him who is] on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>[Set] the trumpet to your mouth. As an eagle [he comes] against the house of Yahweh, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They shall cry to me, My God, we Israel know you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I didn`t know it: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>He has cast off your calf, Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be before they attain to innocence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yes, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he has no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel in which none delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they are gone up to Assyria, [like] a wild donkey alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yes, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Yahweh doesn`t accept them: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall devour the castles of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Don`t rejoice, Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for you have played the prostitute, [departing] from your God; you have loved hire on every grain-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in Yahweh`s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Yahweh, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all who eat of it shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, behold, they have gone away from destruction; [yet] Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation have come, the days of recompense have come. Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man who has the spirit is mad, for the abundance of your iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler`s snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</verse>
