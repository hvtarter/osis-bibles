        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed is the man who doesn`t walk in the counsel of the wicked,    Nor stand in the way of sinners,    Nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight is in the law of Yahweh;    On his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>He shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,    That brings forth its fruit in its season,    Whose leaf also does not wither.    Whatever he does shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>The wicked are not so,    But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why do the nations rage,    And the peoples plot a vain thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth take a stand,    And the rulers take counsel together,    Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>"Let us break their bonds apart,    And cast away their cords from us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He who sits in the heavens will laugh.    The Lord will have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he will speak to them in his anger,    And terrify them in his wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>"Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the decree.    Yahweh said to me, "You are my son.    Today I have become your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,    The uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You shall break them with a rod of iron.    You shall dash them in pieces like a potter`s vessel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now therefore be wise, you kings.    Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve Yahweh with fear,    And rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,    For his wrath will soon be kindled.    Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.      Psalm 3  A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom, his son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Many there are who say of my soul,    There is no help for him in God. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,    My glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>I cry to Yahweh with my voice,    And he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I laid myself down and slept.    I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people    Who have set themselves against me on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.    You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongs to Yahweh.    Your blessing be on your people. Selah.       Psalm 4  For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.    Give me relief from my distress.    Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?    Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>Yahweh, in the morning shall you hear my voice.    In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch       expectantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.    Evil can`t live with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.    You hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>You will destroy those who speak lies.    Yahweh abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, in the abundance of your lovingkindness I will       come into your house:    I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies.    Make your way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.    Their inward part is destruction.    Their throat is an open tomb.    They flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Hold them guilty, God.    Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,    For they have rebelled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,    Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,    If there is iniquity in my hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me    (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,    And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, Yahweh, in your anger.    Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</verse>
