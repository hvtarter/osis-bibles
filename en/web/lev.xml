        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>If it be a animal, whereof men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>If he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a field devoted; the possession of it shall be the priest`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>If he sanctify to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation to the year of jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>All your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Yahweh`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>If it be of an unclean animal, then he shall ransom it according to your estimation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it isn`t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh`s: it is holy to Yahweh.</verse>
