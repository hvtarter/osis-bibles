      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for love`s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beg you for my child, whom I have fathered in my bonds, Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I wanted to keep with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, specially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
