      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe`s household, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now I mean this, that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," and, "I follow Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don`t know whether I baptized any other.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel -- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn`t be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn`t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn`t know God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh should boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>When I came to you, brothers, I didn`t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith wouldn`t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds to our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn`t have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, "Things which eye didn`t see, and ear didn`t hear, Which didn`t enter into the heart of man, Whatever things God prepared for those who love him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God`s Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>Now the natural man doesn`t receive the things of the God`s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can`t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ`s mind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>Brothers, I couldn`t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren`t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren`t you fleshly, and don`t you walk in the ways of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren`t you fleshly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God`s fellow workers. You are God`s farming, God`s building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each man`s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man`s work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man`s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man`s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Don`t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God`s Spirit lives in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God`s temple is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ`s, and Christ is God`s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>So let a man think of us as Christ`s servants, and stewards of God`s mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man`s judgment. Yes, I don`t judge my own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn`t receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ`s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>We toil, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I don`t write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you want? Will I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father`s wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>You are puffed up, and didn`t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I most assuredly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Don`t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But as it is, I wrote to you not to keep company, if any man who is named a brother is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don`t even eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don`t you judge those who are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those who are outside, God judges. "Put away the wicked man from among yourselves."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Don`t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Don`t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to move you to shame. What, can`t there be one wise man among you who will be able to decide between his brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or don`t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don`t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be brought under the power of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods," but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Don`t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Will I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or don`t you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, "The two," says he, "will become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee sexual immorality. "Every sin that a man does is outside the body," but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or don`t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God`s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me. It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But, because of sexual sins, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render to the wife her due, and likewise also the wife to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife doesn`t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn`t have power over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Don`t defraud one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn`t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they don`t have self-control, let them marry. For it`s better to marry than to burn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>But to the married I command -- not I, but the Lord -- that the wife not leave her husband</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord`s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ`s bondservant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world -- how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>This I say for your own profit; not that I may throw a snare on you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn`t sin. Let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn`t give her in marriage will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound by law for so long time as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God`s Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol`s temple, won`t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>If they were all one member, where would the body be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now they are many members, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>The eye can`t tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>God has set some in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But desire earnestly the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don`t have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don`t have love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>If I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don`t have love, it profits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient and is kind; love doesn`t envy. Love doesn`t brag, is not proud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>doesn`t behave itself inappropriately, doesn`t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>doesn`t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>But now remain faith, hope, and love: these three. The greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn`t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet gave an uncertain voice, who would prepare himself for war?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I don`t know the meaning of the voice, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Else if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn`t know what you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you most assuredly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, don`t be children in mind, yet in malice be babies, but in mind be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won`t they say that you are crazy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>let your women keep silence in the assemblies, for it is not permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the Law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or did it come to you alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don`t forbid speaking with other languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I declare to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you -- unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not found vain, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn`t raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead aren`t raised, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ`s, at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren`t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I die daily, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If I fought with animals at Ephesus like men, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Don`t be deceived! "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Wake up righteously, and don`t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>That which you sow, you don`t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However that which is spiritual isn`t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let`s also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can`t inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is       swallowed up in victory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>"Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord`s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
