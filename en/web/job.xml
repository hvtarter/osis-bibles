  <div osisID='Job' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts." Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it happened on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"     Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Haven`t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don`t put forth your hand."     So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, "The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>He said, "Naked I came out of my mother`s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again it happened on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"     Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said to him, "Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"     In all this Job didn`t sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job`s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn`t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>Job answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>"Let the day perish in which I was born,    The night which said, `There is a man-child conceived.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness;    Don`t let God from above seek for it,    Neither let the light shine on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.    Let a cloud dwell on it.    Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.    Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.    Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Behold, let that night be barren.    Let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it who curse the day,    Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark.    Let it look for light, but have none,    Neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it didn`t shut up the doors of my mother`s womb,    Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>"Why didn`t I die from the womb?    Why didn`t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me?    Or why the breast, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain down and been quiet.    I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counselors of the earth,    Who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes who had gold,    Who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,    As infants who never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling;    There the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together.    They don`t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there.    The servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>"Why is light given to him who is in misery,    Life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, but it doesn`t come;    Dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice exceedingly,    Are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,    Whom God has hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat,    My groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I fear comes on me,    That which I am afraid of comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;    But trouble comes."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>"If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?    But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, you have instructed many,    You have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have supported him who was falling,    You have made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it is come to you, and you faint;    It touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Isn`t your piety your confidence,    The integrity of your ways your hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>"Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?    Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,    And sow trouble,    Reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish,    By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,    The teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey,    The whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>"Now a thing was secretly brought to me,    My ear received a whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night,    When deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came on me, and trembling,    Which made all my bones shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face;    The hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I couldn`t discern the appearance of it;    A form was before my eyes.    Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>`Shall mortal man be more just than God?    Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.    He charges his angels with error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,    Whose foundation is in the dust,    Who are crushed before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Between morning and evening they are destroyed.    They perish forever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Isn`t their tent-cord plucked up within them?    They die, and that without wisdom.`</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>"Call now; is there any who will answer you?    To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For resentment kills the foolish man,    And jealousy kills the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root,    But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety,    They are crushed in the gate.    Neither is there any to deliver them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eats up,    Takes it even out of the thorns;    The snare gapes for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction doesn`t come forth from the dust,    Neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But man is born to trouble,    As the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>"But as for me, I would seek God,    To God would I commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who does great things that can`t be fathomed,    Marvelous things without number;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who gives rain on the earth,    And sends waters on the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>So that he sets up on high those who are low,    Those who mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty,    So that their hands can`t perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own craftiness;    The counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the day-time,    And grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves from the sword of their mouth,    Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor has hope,    And injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects:    Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he wounds, and binds up;    He injures, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver you in six troubles;    Yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem you from death;    In war, from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,    Neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and dearth you shall laugh,    Neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you shall be in league with the stones of the field.    The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>You shall know that your tent is in peace.    You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You shall know also that your seed shall be great,    Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You shall come to your grave in a full age,    Like a shock of grain comes in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Look this, we have searched it, so it is;    Hear it, and know it for your good."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>"Oh that my anguish were weighed,    And all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,    Therefore have my words been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,    My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuses to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>"Oh that I might have my request;    That God would grant the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to crush me;    That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Be it still my consolation,    Yes, let me exult in pain that doesn`t spare,    That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait?    What is my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones?    Or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Isn`t it that I have no help in me,    That wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>"To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his       friend;    Even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,    As the channel of brooks that pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are black by reason of the ice,    in which the snow hides itself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>In the dry season, they vanish.    When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The caravans that travel beside them turn aside;    They go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked,    The companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because they had hoped;    They came there, and were confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now you are nothing.    You see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, `Give to me?`    Or, `Offer a present for me from your substance?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, `Deliver me from the adversary`s hand?`    Or, `Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>"Teach me, and I will hold my peace;    Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are words of uprightness!    But your reproof, what does it reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do you intend to reprove words,    Seeing that the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,    And make merchandise of your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be pleased to look at me,    For surely I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Please return. Let there be no injustice;    Yes, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue?    Can`t my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>"Isn`t a man forced to labor on earth?    Aren`t his days like the days of a hired hand?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>"I know that you can do all things,    And that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>You asked, `Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?`    Therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,    Things too wonderful for me, which I didn`t know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>You said, `Listen, now, and I will speak;    I will question you, and you will answer me.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,    But now my eye sees you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I abhor myself,    And repent in dust and ashes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons` sons, to four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.                 BOOK I       Psalm 1</verse>
