      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which he promised before through his prophets in the holy scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>through whom we received grace and apostleship, to obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name`s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>Among whom you are also called to be Jesus Christ`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>requesting, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other`s faith, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I don`t desire to have you unaware, brothers, that often I planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith to faith. As it is written, "But the righteous shall live by faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>because that which is known by God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, knowing God, they didn`t glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are without excuse, man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Do you know this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who "will render to every man according to his works:"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but to those who are self-seeking, and don`t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, on the Jew first, and also on the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory and honor and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For it isn`t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>(for when Gentiles who don`t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You therefore who teach another, don`t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn`t steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say a man shouldn`t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision indeed profits, if you be a doer of the law, but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won`t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>Won`t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way! Because first of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith make of no effect the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Certainly not! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "That you might be justified in your words, And might prevail when you come into judgment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Certainly not! For then how will God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written, "There is no one righteous. No, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>"Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit."  "The poison of vipers is under their lips;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>"Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery are in their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>The way of peace, they haven`t known."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>"There is no fear of God before their eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done before, in the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for the showing of his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn`t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>if it is so that God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? Certainly not! No, we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him who works, the reward is not accounted as of grace, but as of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him who doesn`t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, Whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not charge with sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father, Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations." This is before him whom he believed, God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, "So will your seed be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>Without being weakened in faith, he didn`t consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah`s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>Yet, looking to the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Therefore also it was "reckoned to him for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and hope doesn`t disappoint us, because God`s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For one will hardly die for a righteous man. For perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God`s wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren`t like Adam`s disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift isn`t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as through the one man`s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one will many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What will we say then? Will we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Certainly not! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or don`t you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who has died has been freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For the death that he died, he died to sin once; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Thus also consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore don`t let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Will we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Don`t you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were servants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Being made free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or don`t you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What will we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! However, I wouldn`t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn`t have known coveting, unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>The commandment, which was to life, this I found to be to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did then that which is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For I don`t know what I am doing. For I don`t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if what I don`t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don`t find it doing that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good which I desire, I don`t do; but the evil which I don`t desire, that I practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if what I don`t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in God`s law after the inward man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don`t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law couldn`t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are after the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God`s law, neither indeed can it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>Those who are in the flesh can`t please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn`t have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you didn`t receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba! Father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the creation waits with eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which we don`t see, we wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don`t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can`t be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit`s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Whom he foreordained, them he also called. Whom he called, them he also justified. Whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then will we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who didn`t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who could bring a charge against God`s elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>Even as it is written, "For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers` sake, my relatives according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>Neither, because they are Abraham`s seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What will we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brothers, my heart`s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For being ignorant of God`s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn`t subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don`t say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?` (that is, to bring Christ down);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or, `Who will descend into the abyss?` (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they didn`t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, didn`t they hear? Yes, most assuredly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, Their words to the ends of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I ask, didn`t Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>Isaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who didn`t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn`t ask for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I ask then, Did God reject his people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God didn`t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don`t you know what the scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn`t obtain, but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, A stumbling block, and a retribution to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? Certainly not! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if the rejection of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what would the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root of the richness of the olive tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>don`t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who bear the root, but the root you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don`t be conceited, but fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>for if God didn`t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>They also, if they don`t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I don`t desire, brothers, to have you ignorant of this mystery, so that you won`t be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles have come in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, And he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>This is my covenant to them, When I will take away their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>Concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers` sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>"For who has known the mind of the Lord?    Or who has been his counselor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>"Or who has first given to him,    And it will be repaid to him again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>Therefore I beg you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>Don`t be fashioned according to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don`t have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>rejoicing in hope; enduring in oppression; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don`t curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don`t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don`t be wise in your own conceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Don`t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God`s wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him.    If he is thirsty, give him a drink.    For in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Don`t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who be are ordained by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn`t bear the sword in vain; for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience` sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God`s service, attending continually on this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Give therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not give false testimony," "You shall not covet," and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love doesn`t harm his neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>This, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awake out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let`s therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let`s put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>But receive him who is weak in faith, not for judging thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Don`t let him who eats despise him who doesn`t eat. Don`t let him who doesn`t eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you who judge the servant of another? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteems one day above another. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn`t eat, to the Lord he doesn`t eat, and gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord`s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, "`As I live,` says the Lord, `to me every knee will bow.    Every tongue will confess to God.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Therefore Let`s not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother`s way, or an occasion of falling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don`t destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Then don`t let your good be slandered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may build one another up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Don`t overthrow God`s work for food`s sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good not to eat meat, drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn`t judge himself in that which he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn`t of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.24'>Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence through eternal times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.25'>but now is revealed, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known to all the nations to obedience of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.26'>to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For Christ also didn`t please himself. But, as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore receive one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Christ has been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, And sing to your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>Again he says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>Again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Let all the peoples praise him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>Again, Isaiah says, "There will be the root of Jesse, He who arises to rule over the Gentiles; On him will the Gentiles hope."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I write the more boldly to you in some measure, as putting you again in memory, because of the grace that was given to me by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God`s Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>yes, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another man`s foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But, as it is written, "They will see, to whom no news of him came. They who haven`t heard will understand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.16.1'>I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.16.2'>that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.16.16'>Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.16.17'>Now I beg you, brothers, mark those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.16.18'>For those who are such don`t serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.</verse>
