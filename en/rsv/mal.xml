      <chapter osisID='Mal.1'>
        <title>And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, `They are my people'; and they will say, `The LORD is my God.'"</title>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.1'>The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by Mal'achi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.2'>"I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How hast thou loved us?" "Is not Esau Jacob's brother?" says the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.3'>but I have hated Esau; I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.4'>If Edom says, "We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins," the LORD of hosts says, "They may build, but I will tear down, till they are called the wicked country, the people with whom the LORD is angry for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.5'>Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, "Great is the LORD, beyond the border of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.6'>"A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. You say, `How have we despised thy name?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.7'>By offering polluted food upon my altar. And you say, `How have we polluted it?' By thinking that the LORD's table may be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.8'>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that no evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that no evil? Present that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.9'>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.10'>Oh, that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire upon my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.11'>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.12'>But you profane it when you say that the LORD's table is polluted, and the food for it may be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.13'>`What a weariness this is,' you say, and you sniff at me, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.14'>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished; for I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name is feared among the nations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.1'>"And now, O priests, this command is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.2'>If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.3'>Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.4'>So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may hold, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.5'>My covenant with him was a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him, that he might fear; and he feared me, he stood in awe of my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.6'>True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.7'>For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.8'>But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.9'>and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.10'>Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.11'>Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.12'>May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob, for the man who does this, any to witness or answer, or to bring an offering to the LORD of hosts!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.13'>And this again you do. You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.14'>You ask, "Why does he not?" Because the LORD was witness to the covenant between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.15'>Has not the one God made and sustained for us the spirit of life? And what does he desire? Godly offspring. So take heed to yourselves, and let none be faithless to the wife of his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.16'>"For I hate divorce, says the LORD the God of Israel, and covering one's garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.17'>You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Every one who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them." Or by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.1'>"Behold, I send my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.2'>But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?  "For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.3'>he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, till they present right offerings to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.4'>Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.5'>"Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.6'>"For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.7'>From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, `How shall we return?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.8'>Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, `How are we robbing thee?' In your tithes and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.9'>You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me; the whole nation of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.10'>Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house; and thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.11'>I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil; and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.12'>Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.13'>"Your words have been stout against me, says the LORD. Yet you say, `How have we spoken against thee?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.14'>You have said, `It is vain to serve God. What is the good of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.15'>Henceforth we deem the arrogant blessed; evildoers not only prosper but when they put God to the test they escape.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.16'>Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another; the LORD heeded and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and thought on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.17'>"They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.18'>Then once more you shall distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.1'>"For behold, the day comes, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.2'>But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go forth leaping like calves from the stall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.3'>And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.4'>"Remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.5'>"Behold, I will send you Eli'jah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.6'>And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse."</verse>
