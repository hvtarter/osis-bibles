        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his anointed, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>"I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my son, today I have begotten you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve the LORD with fear, with trembling</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>kiss his feet, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of my enemies; make thy way straight before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is destruction, their throat is an open sepulchre, they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.14.2'>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.18.1'>To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.2'>I love thee, O LORD, my strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.3'>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.4'>I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.5'>The cords of death encompassed me, the torrents of perdition assailed me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.6'>the cords of Sheol entangled me, the snares of death confronted me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.7'>In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.8'>Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.9'>Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.10'>He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.11'>He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.12'>He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.13'>Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.14'>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.15'>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.16'>Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.17'>He reached from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.18'>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.19'>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.20'>He brought me forth into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.21'>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.22'>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.23'>For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.24'>I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.25'>Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.26'>With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal; with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.18.28'>For thou dost deliver a humble people; but the haughty eyes thou dost bring down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.29'>Yea, thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.30'>Yea, by thee I can crush a troop; and by my God I can leap over a wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.31'>This God--his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.32'>For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.33'>the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.34'>He made my feet like hinds' feet, and set me secure on the heights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.35'>He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.36'>Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me, and thy help made me great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.37'>Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.38'>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back till they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.39'>I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.40'>For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; thou didst make my assailants sink under me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.41'>Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.42'>They cried for help, but there was none to save, they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.43'>I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.44'>Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples; thou didst make me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.45'>As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.46'>Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their fastnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.47'>The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.48'>the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.49'>who delivered me from my enemies; yea, thou didst exalt me above my adversaries; thou didst deliver me from men of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.18.50'>For this I will extol thee, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to thy name. [ (Psalms 18:51) Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants for ever. ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.7'>Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.36.6'>Thy steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, thy faithfulness to the clouds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.36.7'>Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God, thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast thou savest, O LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.38.13'>Those who seek my life lay their snares, those who seek my hurt speak of ruin, and meditate treachery all the day long.</verse>
