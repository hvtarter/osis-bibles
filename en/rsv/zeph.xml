        <title>But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him.</title>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.1'>The word of the LORD which came to Zephani'ah the son of Cushi, son of Gedali'ah, son of Amari'ah, son of Hezeki'ah, in the days of Josi'ah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.2'>"I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth," says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.3'>"I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. I will overthrow the wicked; I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth," says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>"I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Ba'al and the name of the idolatrous priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens; those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by Milcom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>those who have turned back from following the LORD, who do not seek the LORD or inquire of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is at hand; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>And on the day of the LORD'S sacrifice--"I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all who array themselves in foreign attire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>On that day I will punish every one who leaps over the threshold, and those who fill their master's house with violence and fraud."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>"On that day," says the LORD, "a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, a loud crash from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar! For all the traders are no more; all who weigh out silver are cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are thickening upon their lees, those who say in their hearts, `The LORD will not do good, nor will he do ill.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>Their goods shall be plundered, and their houses laid waste. Though they build houses, they shall not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they shall not drink wine from them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>The great day of the LORD is near, near and hastening fast; the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter, the mighty man cries aloud there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>A day of wrath is that day, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the lofty battlements.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>I will bring distress on men, so that they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD; their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.18'>Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. In the fire of his jealous wrath, all the earth shall be consumed; for a full, yea, sudden end he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Come together and hold assembly, O shameless nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>before you are driven away like the drifting chaff, before there comes upon you the fierce anger of the LORD, before there comes upon you the day of the wrath of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, who do his commands; seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the wrath of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For Gaza shall be deserted, and Ash'kelon shall become a desolation; Ashdod's people shall be driven out at noon, and Ekron shall be uprooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast, you nation of the Cher'ethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you till no inhabitant is left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.6'>And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures, meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah, on which they shall pasture, and in the houses of Ash'kelon they shall lie down at evening. For the LORD their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>"I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>Therefore, as I live," says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Moab shall become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomor'rah, a land possessed by nettles and salt pits, and a waste for ever. The remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the survivors of my nation shall possess them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>This shall be their lot in return for their pride, because they scoffed and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>The LORD will be terrible against them; yea, he will famish all the gods of the earth, and to him shall bow down, each in its place, all the lands of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>You also, O Ethiopians, shall be slain by my sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and he will make Nin'eveh a desolation, a dry waste like the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.14'>Herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the field; the vulture and the hedgehog shall lodge in her capitals; the owl shall hoot in the window, the raven croak on the threshold; for her cedar work will be laid bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>This is the exultant city that dwelt secure, that said to herself, "I am and there is none else." What a desolation she has become, a lair for wild beasts! Every one who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Woe to her that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressing city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She listens to no voice, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the LORD, she does not draw near to her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her officials within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves that leave nothing till the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets are wanton, faithless men; her priests profane what is sacred, they do violence to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>The LORD within her is righteous, he does no wrong; every morning he shows forth his justice, each dawn he does not fail; but the unjust knows no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>"I have cut off nations; their battlements are in ruins; I have laid waste their streets so that none walks in them; their cities have been made desolate, without a man, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>I said, `Surely she will fear me, she will accept correction; she will not lose sight of all that I have enjoined upon her.' But all the more they were eager to make all their deeds corrupt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.8'>"Therefore wait for me," says the LORD, "for the day when I arise as a witness. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all the heat of my anger; for in the fire of my jealous wrath all the earth shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>"Yea, at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.10'>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed ones, shall bring my offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.11'>"On that day you shall not be put to shame because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me; for then I will remove from your midst your proudly exultant ones, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.12'>For I will leave in the midst of you a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.13'>those who are left in Israel; they shall do no wrong and utter no lies, nor shall there be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue. For they shall pasture and lie down, and none shall make them afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.14'>Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.15'>The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has cast out your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear evil no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.16'>On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear, O Zion; let not your hands grow weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.17'>The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.18'>as on a day of festival. "I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.19'>Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.20'>At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you together; yea, I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes," says the LORD.</verse>
