  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent The-oph'ilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you may know the truth concerning the things of which you have been informed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechari'ah, of the division of Abi'jah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zechari'ah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechari'ah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>for he will be great before the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Eli'jah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zechari'ah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zechari'ah, and they wondered at his delay in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And he came to her and said, "Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel, "How shall this be, since I have no husband?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing will be impossible."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and she entered the house of Zechari'ah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and she exclaimed with a loud cry, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with his arm, he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>he has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low degree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his posterity for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechari'ah after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>but his mother said, "Not so; he shall be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, "None of your kindred is called by this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, "What then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zechari'ah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God, when the day shall dawn upon us from on high</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first enrollment, when Quirin'i-us was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, "Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be a sign for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord")</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, "a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for mine eyes have seen thy salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phan'u-el, of the tribe of Asher; she was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposing him to be in the company they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiber'i-us Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Iturae'a and Trachoni'tis, and Lysa'ni-as tetrarch of Abile'ne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high-priesthood of Annas and Ca'iaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechari'ah in the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>and he went into all the region about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bear fruits that befit repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the multitudes asked him, "What then shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answered them, "He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, "Collect no more than is appointed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Rob no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered them all, "I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>So, with many other exhortations, he preached good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Hero'di-as, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form, as a dove, and a voice came from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>And they rose up and put him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But passing through the midst of them he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>And he went down to Caper'na-um, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>"Ah! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all amazed and said to one another, "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And reports of him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they besought him for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she rose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also came out of many, crying, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was day he departed and went into a lonely place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>While the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennes'aret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they enclosed a great shoal of fish; and as their nets were breaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were James and John, sons of Zeb'edee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and besought him, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he charged him to tell no one; but "go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But so much the more the report went abroad concerning him; and great multitudes gathered to hear and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>On one of those days, as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when he saw their faith he said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, "Why do you question in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, `Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the man who was paralyzed--"I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And he left everything, and rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And Jesus said to them, "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He told them a parable also: "No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says, `The old is good.'"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>On a sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>And Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And he said to them, "The Son of man is lord of the sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another sabbath, when he entered the synagogue and taught, a man was there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Come and stand here." And he rose and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And he looked around on them all, and said to him, "Stretch out your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>In these days he went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>After he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered Caper'na-um.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>Now a centurion had a slave who was dear to him, who was sick and at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>When he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy to have you do this for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and he built us our synagogue."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; and to another, `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard this he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him, "I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon afterward he went to a city called Na'in, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a large crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and "God has visited his people!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report concerning him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>The disciples of John told him of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, `Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he who takes no offense at me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When the messengers of John had gone, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written, `Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>(When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the market place and calling to one another, `We piped to you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not weep.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine; and you say, `He has a demon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and you say, `Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>Yet wisdom is justified by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house, and took his place at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he answered, "What is it, Teacher?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>"A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, "The one, I suppose, to whom he forgave more." And he said to him, "You have judged rightly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, "Who is this, who even forgives sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Mag'dalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joan'na, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>"A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the path, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And some fell into good soil and grew, and yielded a hundredfold." As he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>he said, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>And as for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And he was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he said to them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake." So they set out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even wind and water, and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>Then they arrived at the country of the Ger'asenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And as he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons; for a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Ger'asenes asked him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear; so he got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you." And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And there came a man named Ja'irus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet he besought him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.  As he went, the people pressed round him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, "Who was it that touched me?" When all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, "Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking, a man from the ruler's house came and said, "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus on hearing this answered him, "Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, "Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But taking her by the hand he called, saying, "Child, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>by some that Eli'jah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, "John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>On their return the apostles told him what they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a city called Beth-sa'ida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>When the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, "Send the crowd away, to go into the villages and country round about, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a lonely place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all these people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve baskets of broken pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him; and he asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>And they answered, "John the Baptist; but others say, Eli'jah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>And he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Eli'jah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they wakened they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli'jah"--not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried, "Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him till he foams, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>While he was coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And all were astonished at the majesty of God.  But while they were all marveling at everything he did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>"Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.20'>Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>And he told them a parable, to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>He said, "In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, `Vindicate me against my adversary.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, `Though I neither fear God nor regard man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow bothers me, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God vindicate his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you, he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, `God, I thank thee that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, `God, be merciful to me a sinner!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them; and when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>And a ruler asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: `Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, "All these I have observed from my youth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>And when Jesus heard it, he said to him, "One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard this he became sad, for he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>Jesus looking at him said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But he said, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>And taking the twelve, he said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of man by the prophets will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>they will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hid from them, and they did not grasp what was said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he cried, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>And Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him; and when he came near, he asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>"What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, let me receive my sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>He entered Jericho and was passing through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>And there was a man named Zacchae'us; he was a chief tax collector, and rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchae'us, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>And when they saw it they all murmured, "He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>He said therefore, "A nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom and then return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them, `Trade with these till I come.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>The first came before him, saying, `Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, `Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, `Lord, your pound has made five pounds.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>And he said to him, `And you are to be over five cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another came, saying, `Lord, here is your pound, which I kept laid away in a napkin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He said to him, `I will condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And he said to those who stood by, `Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>(And they said to him, `Lord, he has ten pounds!')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>`I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>When he drew near to Beth'phage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, "Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, "The Lord has need of it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One day, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and said to him, "Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answered them, "I also will ask you a question; now tell me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they discussed it with one another, saying, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, `From men,' all the people will stone us; for they are convinced that John was a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they did not know whence it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country for a long while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, `What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, `This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they said, "God forbid!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he looked at them and said, "What then is this that is written: `The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one it will crush him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he had told this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched him, and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might take hold of what he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>"Show me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?" They said, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>He said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>There came to him some Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>and they asked him a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and died without children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Afterward the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you have spoken well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But he said to them, "How can they say that the Christ is David's son?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and engaged to give him money.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>"Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, "This man also was with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a little later some one else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, "Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>they also blindfolded him and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>"If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>and if I ask you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>And they all said, "Are you the Son of God, then?" And he said to them, "You say that I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>And they said, "What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no crime in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him and release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us Barab'bas"--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>but they shouted out, "Crucify, crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, `Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us'; and to the hills, `Cover us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." And they cast lots to divide his garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!" And having said this he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathe'a. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.  On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>but when they went in they did not find the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now it was Mary Mag'dalene and Jo-an'na and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emma'us, about seven miles from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>And he said to them, "What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>Then one of them, named Cle'opas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And he said to them, "O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>but they constrained him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>who said, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do questionings rise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>and he took it and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</verse>
