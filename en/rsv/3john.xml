        <title>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</title>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder to the beloved Ga'ius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in health; I know that it is well with your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I greatly rejoiced when some of the brethren arrived and testified to the truth of your life, as indeed you do follow the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>No greater joy can I have than this, to hear that my children follow the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, it is a loyal thing you do when you render any service to the brethren, especially to strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey as befits God's service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For they have set out for his sake and have accepted nothing from the heathen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>So we ought to support such men, that we may be fellow workers in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I have written something to the church; but Diot'rephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, prating against me with evil words. And not content with that, he refuses himself to welcome the brethren, and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Deme'trius has testimony from every one, and from the truth itself; I testify to him too, and you know my testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face. [ (III John 1:15) Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, every one of them. ]</verse>
