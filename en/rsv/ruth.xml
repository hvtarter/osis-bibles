      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <title>And the men of Israel turned back against the Benjaminites, and smote them with the edge of the sword, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns which they found they set on fire.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>The name of the man was Elim'elech and the name of his wife Na'omi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chil'ion; they were Eph'rathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>But Elim'elech, the husband of Na'omi, died, and she was left with her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>and both Mahlon and Chil'ion died, so that the woman was bereft of her two sons and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>Then she started with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had visited his people and given them food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>So she set out from the place where she was, with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>But Na'omi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>The LORD grant that you may find a home, each of you in the house of her husband!" Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>And they said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>But Na'omi said, "Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And she said, "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>But Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if even death parts me from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And when Na'omi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said, "Is this Na'omi?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>She said to them, "Do not call me Na'omi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Na'omi, when the LORD has afflicted me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Na'omi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>Now Na'omi had a kinsman of her husband's, a man of wealth, of the family of Elim'elech, whose name was Bo'az.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Na'omi, "Let me go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>So she set forth and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Bo'az, who was of the family of Elim'elech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And behold, Bo'az came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers, "The LORD be with you!" And they answered, "The LORD bless you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>Then Bo'az said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose maiden is this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "It is the Moabite maiden, who came back with Na'omi from the country of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>She said, `Pray, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.' So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, without resting even for a moment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>Then Bo'az said to Ruth, "Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my maidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>Let your eyes be upon the field which they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to molest you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, when I am a foreigner?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>But Bo'az answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>The LORD recompense you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Then she said, "You are most gracious to me, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not one of your maidservants."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And at mealtime Bo'az said to her, "Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the wine." So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her parched grain; and she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>When she rose to glean, Bo'az instructed his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field until evening; then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>And she took it up and went into the city; she showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned, and she also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, "The man's name with whom I worked today is Bo'az."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>And Na'omi said to her daughter-in-law, "Blessed be he by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!" Na'omi also said to her, "The man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>And Ruth the Moabitess said, "Besides, he said to me, `You shall keep close by my servants, till they have finished all my harvest.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And Na'omi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, "It is well, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, lest in another field you be molested."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>So she kept close to the maidens of Bo'az, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>Then Na'omi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek a home for you, that it may be well with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>Now is not Bo'az our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>And she replied, "All that you say I will do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And when Bo'az had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your maidservant; spread your skirt over your maidservant, for you are next of kin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter; you have made this last kindness greater than the first, in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>And now, my daughter, do not fear, I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of worth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>And now it is true that I am a near kinsman, yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will do the part of the next of kin for you, well; let him do it; but if he is not willing to do the part of the next of kin for you, then, as the LORD lives, I will do the part of the next of kin for you. Lie down until the morning."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another; and he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And he said, "Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it out." So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and laid it upon her; then she went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did you fare, my daughter?" Then she told her all that the man had done for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>saying, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, `You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>She replied, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>And Bo'az went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the next of kin, of whom Bo'az had spoken, came by. So Bo'az said, "Turn aside, friend; sit down here"; and he turned aside and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down here"; so they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>Then he said to the next of kin, "Na'omi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our kinsman Elim'elech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>So I thought I would tell you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you." And he said, "I will redeem it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>Then Bo'az said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Na'omi, you are also buying Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the dead, in order to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>Then the next of kin said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>So when the next of kin said to Bo'az, "Buy it for yourself," he drew off his sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>Then Bo'az said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Na'omi all that belonged to Elim'elech and all that belonged to Chil'ion and to Mahlon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his native place; you are witnesses this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>Then all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you prosper in Eph'rathah and be renowned in Bethlehem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the children that the LORD will give you by this young woman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>So Bo'az took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>Then the women said to Na'omi, "Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without next of kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>Then Na'omi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Na'omi." They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>Hezron of Ram, Ram of Ammin'adab,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>Ammin'adab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>Salmon of Bo'az, Bo'az of Obed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David.</verse>
