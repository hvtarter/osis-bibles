        <title>to execute on them the judgment written! This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!</title>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>That men may know wisdom and instruction, understand words of insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>receive instruction in wise dealing, righteousness, justice, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>that prudence may be given to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>the wise man also may hear and increase in learning, and the man of understanding acquire skill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and reject not your mother's teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>for they are a fair garland for your head, and pendants for your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us wantonly ambush the innocent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole, like those who go down to the Pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>throw in your lot among us, we will all have one purse"--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>my son, do not walk in the way with them, hold back your foot from their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>but these men lie in wait for their own blood, they set an ambush for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>Such are the ways of all who get gain by violence; it takes away the life of its possessors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries aloud in the street; in the markets she raises her voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>on the top of the walls she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Give heed to my reproof; behold, I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>and you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacence of fools destroys them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>but he who listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of evil."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>yes, if you cry out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>guarding the paths of justice and preserving the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>discretion will watch over you; understanding will guard you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>You will be saved from the loose woman, from the adventuress with her smooth words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the shades;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>none who go to her come back nor do they regain the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>So you will walk in the way of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright will inhabit the land, and men of integrity will remain in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>for length of days and years of life and abundant welfare will they give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them about your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first fruits of all your produce;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>for the gain from it is better than gain from silver and its profit better than gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>by his knowledge the deeps broke forth, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, keep sound wisdom and discretion; let them not escape from your sight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>If you sit down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Do not be afraid of sudden panic, or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Do not plan evil against your neighbor who dwells trustingly beside you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>for the perverse man is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the abode of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he shows favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.4'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>for I give you good precepts: do not forsake my teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>he taught me, and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.5'>do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. Get wisdom; get insight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.6'>Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.7'>The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.8'>Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.9'>She will place on your head a fair garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.12'>When you walk, your step will not be hampered; and if you run, you will not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.13'>Keep hold of instruction, do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.14'>Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made some one stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.22'>For they are life to him who finds them, and healing to all his flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.23'>Keep your heart with all vigilance; for from it flow the springs of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.24'>Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.25'>Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.26'>Take heed to the path of your feet, then all your ways will be sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.27'>Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, be attentive to my wisdom, incline your ear to my understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of a loose woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>she does not take heed to the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of an alien;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was at the point of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.17'>Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.18'>Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.19'>a lovely hind, a graceful doe. Let her affection fill you at all times with delight, be infatuated always with her love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.20'>Why should you be infatuated, my son, with a loose woman and embrace the bosom of an adventuress?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he watches all his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is caught in the toils of his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.23'>He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is lost.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.6'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.1'>My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.2'>if you are snared in the utterance of your lips, caught in the words of your mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.3'>then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go, hasten, and importune your neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.4'>Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.5'>save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.9'>How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.10'>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.11'>and poverty will come upon you like a vagabond, and want like an armed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>winks with his eyes, scrapes with his feet, points with his finger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>There are six things which the LORD hates, seven which are an abomination to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>a false witness who breathes out lies, and a man who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.20'>My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.21'>Bind them upon your heart always; tie them about your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.22'>When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.23'>For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.24'>to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adventuress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</verse>
