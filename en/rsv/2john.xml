        <title>And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.</title>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children following the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beg you, lady, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we follow his commandments; this is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you follow love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that you may not lose what you have worked for, but may win a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Any one who goes ahead and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into the house or give him any greeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who greets him shares his wicked work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink, but I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you.</verse>
