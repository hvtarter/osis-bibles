        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor has stood in the way of sinners, nor has sat in the seat of the scornful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight is in the Law of Jehovah; and in His Law he meditates day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not wither, and all that he does shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why do the nations rage, and the peoples devise a vain thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah and against His anointed, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let us break and tear away their bonds, and cast away their cords from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He who sits in the Heavens shall laugh; Jehovah shall have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then He shall speak to them in His anger, and terrify them in His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet, I have set My King on My holy hill of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will declare the decree: Jehovah has said unto Me, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potterÂ’s vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>And now be wise, O kings; be instructed, you judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.</verse>

        <title>A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>O Jehovah, how my adversaries have increased! Many are they who rise up against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Many are saying of my soul, There is no deliverance for him in God. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But You, O Jehovah, are a shield for me; my glory, the One who lifts up my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>I cried unto Jehovah with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I lay down and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah sustained me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, O Jehovah; deliver me, O my God; for You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <title>To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm of David.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have enlarged me in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>O you sons of men, how long will you turn My glory into shame? Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that Jehovah has set apart the godly for Himself. Jehovah hears when I call unto Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Tremble, and sin not; commune within your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>There are many who say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>You have put gladness in my heart, more than during the time when their grain and their wine increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, Jehovah, make me dwell in safety.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.2'>Give attention to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for unto You will I pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>My voice shall You hear in the morning, O Jehovah; in the morning I will direct my prayer unto You, and I will look up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For You are not a Mighty God that delights in wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The boastful shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>You shall destroy those who speak lies; Jehovah abhors the man of blood and treachery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, I will come into Your house in the abundance of Your mercy; I will bow down in Your fear toward Your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, O Jehovah, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>But let all those who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For You, O Jehovah, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as with a shield.</verse>

        <title>To the Chief Musician. Sheminith. A Psalm of David.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>O Jehovah, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor chasten me in Your fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am weak; O Jehovah, heal me, for my bones are anxious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul also is exceedingly anxious; but You, O Jehovah, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O Jehovah, rescue my soul! Deliver me because of Your goodness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will give thanks to You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary from my groaning; all night I make my bed swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>My eye has wasted away because of grief; it has grown weak because of all my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>Jehovah has heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.10'>Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly dismayed; let them turn back and be ashamed in a moment.</verse>

        <title> A song of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.1'>O Jehovah my God, in You I put my trust; deliver me from all those who pursue me, and rescue me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.2'>lest they tear my soul like a lion, tearing it in pieces, and there is no one to rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O Jehovah my God, if I have done this: if there is iniquity in my hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>if I have repaid evil to one who was at peace with me, or if I have plundered my enemy without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; yea, let him trample down my life upon the earth and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; lift up Yourself because of the rage of my enemies, and arouse Yourself for me to the judgment which You have commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>Thus the congregation of the people shall surround You; for their sakes, therefore, return on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.8'>Jehovah shall judge the people; judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.9'>O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just. For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.10'>My defense is from God, who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.11'>God judges the righteous, and the Mighty God is angry with the wicked every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.12'>If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.13'>He has also prepared instruments of death for him; He makes His arrows hotly pursue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.14'>Behold, he writhes in iniquity, and has conceived trouble, and has brought forth falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>He has excavated a cistern and dug it, and has fallen into the pit which he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His trouble shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.17'>I will praise Jehovah according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.2'>Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.35.3'>Also draw out the spear and close up the way against those who pursue me; say to my soul, I am your salvation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.6'>Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of Jehovah pursue them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.12'>They rewarded me evil for good, to the bereavement of my soul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.16'>with the hypocrites, mockers, for a cake, they gnashed at me with their teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.35.17'>O Jehovah, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my only one from the lions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.35.24'>Give judgment for me, O Jehovah my God, according to Your righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.35.25'>Let them not say in their hearts, Aha! Our Soul! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.35.26'>Let them be ashamed and abashed together, those who rejoice over my adversity. Let them be clothed with shame and reproach who magnify themselves against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.35.27'>Let those who delight in my justification shout and rejoice; and let them say continually, Let Jehovah be magnified, who delights in the welfare of His servant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.38.1'>O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, neither chasten me in Your fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.2'>For Your arrows pierce me, and Your hand presses down upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.3'>There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger, nor peace within myself because of my sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.4'>For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.5'>My wounds have stunk and festered, because of my foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.6'>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all day long.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.38.9'>Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.10'>My heart pants; my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.11'>My lovers and my friends stand at a distance from my plague; and my relatives stand afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.12'>And those who seek my life lay snares for me; and those who seek my hurt speak of destruction, and devise treachery all day long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.38.13'>But like one who is deaf, I do not hear; and I am like a mute one who opens not his mouth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.44.1'>We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work which You did in their days, in the days of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.2'>You drove out the nations with Your hand, and planted them; You brought evil upon peoples and cast them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.3'>For they did not take the land into possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but it was Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.4'>You are my king, O God; command victories for Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.5'>Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.6'>For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword deliver me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.7'>But You have delivered us from our enemies, and have put to shame those who hated us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.8'>In God we have boasted all day long, and praise Your name forever. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.9'>But You have cast us off and put us to shame, and You do not go forth with our armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.10'>You make us turn back from the enemy; and those who hate us have plundered for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.11'>You have given us up like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.12'>You sell Your people for nothing, and have not increased wealth by their price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.13'>You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those who are round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.14'>You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.15'>My disgrace is daily before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.16'>because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles; before the enemy and avenger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.17'>All this has come upon us; yet we have not forgotten You, nor dealt falsely with Your Covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.18'>Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps turned aside from Your way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.19'>though You have crushed us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.20'>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.21'>shall not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.22'>Yet, for Your sake we are killed all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.23'>Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arise! Do not cast us off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.24'>Why do You hide Your face, and forget our affliction and distress?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.25'>For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.44.26'>Arise for our help, and redeem us through Your mercy!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.45.16'>In the place of your fathers shall be your sons, whom you will make princes in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.45.17'>I will make Your name to be remembered from generation to generation; therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.50.17'>seeing as how you hate correction, and cast off My Words behind you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.50.18'>When you saw a thief, then you were pleased to be with him, and have been a partaker with adulterers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.50.19'>You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.36'>Nevertheless they deceived Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.59'>When God heard this, He was angry, and greatly despised Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.60'>so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had placed among men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemyÂ’s hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.64'>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a mighty man overcome with wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>And He struck His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has founded forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.71'>from following the ewes nursing their young He brought him, to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.</verse>
