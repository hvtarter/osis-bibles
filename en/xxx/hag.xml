      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah; and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, and this house to lie waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>And now, thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart on your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but do not have enough; you drink, but are not filled with drink; you put on clothes, but no one is warm. And, one hiring himself out earns wages for a bag of holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart on your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build this house. And I will be pleased with it, and I will be glorified, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>You looked for much, and, lo, it came to little. And when you brought it home, then I blew on it. Why? says Jehovah of Hosts. Because of My house that is in ruins, and you, each man, runs to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>On account of this, the heavens above you hold back the dew, and the earth holds back her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought in the land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on man, and on livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him. And the people feared before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>And Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, spoke the message of Jehovah to the people, saying, I am with you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of Jehovah of Hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh month, on the twenty-first of the month, the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who is left among you who saw this house in her former glory? And how do you see it now? When compared to it, is it not as nothing in your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Jehovah. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land, and work, says Jehovah. For I am with you, says Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>According to the Word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit stands among you; do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more (it is a little while), and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says Jehovah of Hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Now ask the priests the Law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>If one carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches his skirt to the bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>And Haggai said, If an unclean body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>And Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before Me, declares Jehovah. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now set your heart on it, from this day and onward: before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>since those days, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty from the wine trough, there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I struck you with blight, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not turn to Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of JehovahÂ’s temple was laid. Consider in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And again the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai, in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says Jehovah, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
