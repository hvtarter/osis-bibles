        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The Elder, to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and bore witness of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because they went forth on behalf of His name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, ranting against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and prevents those who want to, putting them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
