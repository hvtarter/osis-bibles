  <div osisID='Titus' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of GodÂ’s elect and full true knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life which God, who is without lie, promised before the beginning of time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but has in due time proclaimed His Word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I assigned you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of loose behavior or disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable, a lover of what is good, of a sound mind, just, holy, self-controlled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast the faithful Word according to the teaching, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many insubordinate, idle talkers and seducers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths must be stopped, who overturn whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men that turn away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and reprobate with regard to every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise exhort the young men to be of sound mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he who is in opposition may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Let bondservants be obedient to their own masters, well pleasing in all things, not answering back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live with sound mind, righteously, and godly in the present age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify a people for His own possession, zealous unto good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey superiors, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no one, not being a brawler, but fair, showing all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that being justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those believing in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questionings, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Shun a man of heresy after the first and second admonition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a person is corrupt and sinning, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with diligence, that they may lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
