  <div osisID='2Tim' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, how without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but partake in the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has deprived death of its power and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep safe what I have committed to Him until that Day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold fast the form of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>That good thing which was committed to you, guard it by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day; and you know very well how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will also be able to teach others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>You therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No one serving military duty entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The hard-working farmer should rightfully be first to partake of the crops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say, and the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of bonds; but the Word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>This is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we endure, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to argue with empty words to no good, to the destruction of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will proceed to more ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already come; and they overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>But flee youthful lusts; and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But avoid foolish and unlearned questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>Besides, a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance unto a full true knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, despisers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>always learning, but never able to come to the full true knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>But as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and pretenders will grow worse and worse, leading astray and being led astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But you continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All Scripture is breathed by God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts, desiring to hear pleasant things, they will heap up for themselves teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Hereafter, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all the ones loving His appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Endeavor to come to me quickly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas has deserted me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica; Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come; and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil. The Lord render to him according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>You also be on guard against him, for he has greatly opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defense no one stood with me, but all deserted me. May it not be reckoned against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the preaching of the message might be fulfilled through me, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and keep me safe for His Heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I have left in Miletus sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
