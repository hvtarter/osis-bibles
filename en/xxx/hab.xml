      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O Jehovah, how long shall I cry for help, and You will not hear? I cry out to You, Violence! But You do not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why do You show me evil, and You cause me to look upon toil? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>On account of this the law has become feeble, and justice does not continue to go forth. For the wicked surrounds the righteous, so justice goes forth, perverted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Look among the nations and see, and be amazed. Be astounded. For a work is working in your days which you will not believe, though it be told to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, the bitter and hasty nation which is proceeding into the breadth of the land, to possess dwellings that are not their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>They are terrible and fearful; their judgment and their glory goes forth from themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves. And their horsemen spread themselves; yea, their horsemen come from afar; they fly as the eagle hurrying to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>All of them shall come for violence; the eagerness of their faces is like the east wind; and they gather captives like the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And they shall scoff against kings, and officials shall be a scorn to them. They shall scorn every fortress, and they shall heap up dirt and capture it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then shall his mind change; and he shall pass over and be guilty, crediting this power of his to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>Are You not from ancient times, Jehovah my God, my Holy One? We shall not die, Jehovah, for You have appointed them for judgment. And, my Rock, You have established them for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and You are not able to look upon vexation. Why do you look on those who deal deceitfully? Will You be silent when the wicked swallows one more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>For You make man like the fish of the sea, like creeping things with no ruler over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>They take up all of them with the hook; they drag them with the net and gather them with the dragnet. On account of this they rejoice and exult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their dragnet; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plentiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall they therefore empty their net, and shall they not spare to continually slay nations?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand my watch and set myself on the tower, and watch to see what He will say to me, and what I shall reply when I am corrected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision and make it plain on the tablets, that he who reads it may run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it speaks forth to the end, and it does not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, because it will come and take place; it will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, the soul of him who is puffed up is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>And also, wine indeed betrays a proud man, and he dwells not at home, who widens his soul like Sheol. And he is like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all the nations to himself, and collects all the peoples to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all of these take up a parable against him, and a mocking riddle against him, and say, Woe to him who increases what is not his! How long, then, shall he load himself with many pledges?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall not those who bite you rise up suddenly, and those who vex you be aroused, and you become a booty to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because you have plundered many nations, all the rest of the people shall plunder you, because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, and the city, and all those dwelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe to him who robs unjust gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>You have advised shame for your house, to cut off many peoples, and have sinned in your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam shall answer it from the timbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Behold, is it not of Jehovah of Hosts that the people labor only to feed the fire, and nations weary themselves only for vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe to him who causes his friend to drink, joining with your bottle, and also making him drunk, so as to look upon his nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>You are filled with shame instead of glory; you drink also, and are counted as uncircumcised. The cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall turn on you, and disgrace shall be your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the devastation of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, the city, and all those that dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What does an image profit, that its maker should carve it; a molten image, and a teacher of falsehood, that the maker should trust in his work, to make mute idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake! To a mute stone, Rise up, it shall teach. Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But Jehovah is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet on Shigionoth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>Jehovah, I have heard the report of You, and am afraid. Jehovah, preserve Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His majesty covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And His brightness is as the light; He has rays coming from His hand, and a covering of His strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>A pestilence goes before Him, and lightning goes forth at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations; and the ancient mountains were scattered; the perpetual hills bowed down. His ways are eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan under wickedness; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Was Jehovah furious against the rivers? Or was Your anger against the rivers? Or Your wrath against the sea; that You rode on horses, Your chariots of salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>You bare Your bow naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even Your Word. Selah. You have divided the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains saw You and writhed. The floods of water passed by. The deep uttered its voice and lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they went, at the shining of Your glittering spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>You marched through the land in indignation. You threshed the nations in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked by laying bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>You thrust through with his own arrows the head of his villages. They came out in a rage to scatter me; their exultation was to devour the humble in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>You trod in the sea with Your horses through the surging of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>When I heard, my body trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled within myself, that I might rest in the day of distress. When he comes up against the peoples, he will attack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the work of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food; the flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd is in the stalls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>yet I will exult in Jehovah; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>Jehovah God is my strength, and He makes my feet like does feet, and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer, on Neginoth.</verse>
