  <div osisID='1Thess' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, as you know of what sort we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the Word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you the Word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for His Son from Heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the coming wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not without fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak the gospel of God to you in much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness, nor was it in deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor in pretense of covetousness; God is witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor did we seek honor from men, either from you or from others, when we might have been authoritative as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle among you, just as a nurse cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because you had become beloved to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and uprightly and blamelessly we were among you who believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>as you know how we exhorted, and encouraged, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>that you would walk worthily of God who calls you into His kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the Word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have driven us out; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly, with great desire, to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we wanted to come to you; even I, Paul, time and again; but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we were pleased to be left in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one should be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we were about to suffer affliction, just as it happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also desire to see you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were encouraged concerning you regarding your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus that you should abound more and more, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual perversion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles, who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to impurity, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you abound more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you sorrow not as others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the Word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shouted command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together at the same time with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore encourage one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall by no means escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, that whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore encourage each other and build up one another, just as you also are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, uphold the weak, be longsuffering towards all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>pray without ceasing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>But test all things; hold fast what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
