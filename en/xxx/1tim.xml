  <div osisID='1Tim' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia; remain in Ephesus that you may charge some not to teach other doctrines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which some, having deviated, have turned aside to idle talk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they strongly assert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the Law is good if one uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this: that the Law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for slayers of fathers and slayers of mothers, for murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for prostitutes, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might manifest all longsuffering, as an example to those who are about to believe on Him unto eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>having faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who desires all men to be saved and to come to a full true knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle; I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying; a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in appropriate apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but, that which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>And I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled, fell into transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>Nevertheless she will be kept safe through childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This is a faithful saying: If a man aspires to the position of an overseer, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>An overseer then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, well ordered, hospitable, able to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for money, but fair-minded, not quarrelsome, not loving money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one who rules his own house well, having his children in subjection with all respect</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a new convert, that he not be puffed up with pride and fall into the same condemnation as the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have a good testimony with those who are outside, that he not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Likewise women must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, being devoted to corrupting spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But refuse profane and old wives fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this end we both labor and are reproached, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one despise your youth, but become an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Attend to these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will deliver both yourself and those who hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>older women as mothers, younger ones as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are truly widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she who is truly a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And these things command, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, and not unless she has been the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>being well reported of for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse the younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having condemnation because they have set aside their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary for reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some have already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are truly widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders who lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the Word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain, and, The laborer is worthy of his wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you keep watch over these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other peoples sins; keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine on account of your stomach and your frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some mens sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise, the good works of some are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is proud, understanding nothing, but is sick with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, slander, evil conjecture,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is evident that we can carry nothing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But those who purpose to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which plunge people into ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all evils, for which some being greedy, have strayed from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which He will reveal in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and empty babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
