      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How alone sits the city that was full of people! She has become like a widow, who was once great among the nations, a princess among the nations, but now has come under tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers, she has no one to comfort her. All her friends have dealt deceitfully with her; they have become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah went into captivity under affliction and hard labor. She dwells among the nations; she finds no rest; all her pursuers have overtaken her between the straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The roads of Zion mourn because none go to the appointed meetings. All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her oppressors have become the chief; her enemies are at ease; for Jehovah has afflicted her for the multitude of her sins. Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty has departed. Her rulers have become like deer, who find no pasture, that flee without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>In the days of her affliction and her wandering, Jerusalem remembered all her desirable things from ancient days, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy with no one to help her. The enemies saw her; they laughed at her annihilation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Jerusalem has grievously sinned, therefore she has become impure. All who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; yea, she sighs and turns backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her uncleanness is in her skirts; she did not remember her end, and her downfall was extraordinary. There is no comforter for her. O Jehovah, behold my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The enemy has spread out his hand upon all her desirable things; for she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, whom You commanded that they should not enter into Your assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people sigh; they seek bread. They have given their desirable things for food to restore life. See, O Jehovah, and look upon me, for I have become vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which is done to me, with which Jehovah has afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From above He has sent fire into my bones and it has laid them low. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate and faint all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand, woven together, and thrust upon my neck. He has made my strength to falter; the Lord has delivered me into their hands. I am not able to rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>The Lord has trampled all my mighty ones in my midst; He has called a gathering against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter who could refresh my soul is far from me. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion spreads forth her hands, but no one comforts her. Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob that his enemies should be all around him; Jerusalem has become as an impure thing among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>Jehovah is righteous, for I have rebelled against His command. I beseech you, all peoples, hear and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me; my priests and my elders died in the city while they sought food for them to restore their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Behold, O Jehovah, for I am in distress; my stomach is upset; my heart churns within me, for I have grievously rebelled. Outside the sword bereaves; at home it is like death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They hear that I sigh; but no one comforts me. All my enemies have heard of my evil; they are glad that You have done it. You will bring the day that You have called, and they shall be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Let all their wickedness come before You; and do to them as You have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger! He cast down the beauty of Israel from the heavens to the earth and remembered not His footstool in the day of His anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>The Lord has swallowed up all the dwelling places of Jacob and has not pitied. In His wrath He has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground. He has defiled the kingdom and its rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He has cut off all the horn of Israel in His fierce anger; He has drawn back His right hand from before the enemy, and He burned against Jacob like flaming fire which devours all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He has bent His bow like an enemy; He stood with His right hand like an adversary, and killed all who were desirable to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion. He has poured out His fury like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord was like an enemy; He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all her palaces, and destroyed His strongholds. And He has increased mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And He has done violence to His pavilion like it were a garden, and has destroyed His meeting places. Jehovah has caused the appointed meetings and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and He has despised the king and the priest in the indignation of His anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord has cast off His altar; He has abhorred His sanctuary; He has given up the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have made a sound in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of the appointed meetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>Jehovah has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from devouring, and He made rampart and wall lament; they languish together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her rulers are among the nations. The law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and are silent; they throw dust on their heads; they gird on sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>My eyes fail with tears; my stomach is upset; my liver is poured on the ground for the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the children and the babies faint in the streets of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They say to their mothers, Where are grain and wine? When they faint they are like the wounded in the streets of the city, pouring out their lives into their mothersÂ’ bosoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What can I testify for you? To what thing shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I equal you, so that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your break is great like the sea! Who can heal you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you, and they have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captives; but they have seen false utterances and causes of banishment for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All who pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city which is called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All your enemies have opened their mouth against you; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up. Certainly this is the day that we waited for. We have found it, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>Jehovah has done what He had purposed; He has fulfilled His Word which He commanded in the days of old. He has thrown down and not pitied. And He has caused your enemy to rejoice over you; He has set up the horn of your foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give yourself no rest. Let not the daughter of your eye be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry out in the night. At the beginning of the watches, pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward Him for the life of your children who faint from hunger at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>Behold, O Jehovah, and consider to whom You have done this. Shall the women eat their offspring, children of their tender care? Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>Young and old lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of Your anger; You have slaughtered and not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>You have summoned, as in an appointed day, my terrors all around; and there was not one who escaped, or a survivor in the day of JehovahÂ’s anger. Those whom I have nursed and nurtured, my enemy has consumed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I, the man, have seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>He has led me and made me go in darkness and not in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Surely He is turned against me; He turns His hand all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>He has wasted my flesh and my skin; He has broken my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>He has built against me and has encircled me with bitterness and travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>He has made me live in dark places, like the dead of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>He has fenced me in and I cannot go out; He has made my bronze chain heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Also when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>He walled up my ways with hewn stone; my paths are crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>He was a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>He has turned my ways aside and torn me in pieces. He has made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>He has bent His bow and set me as a target for the arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my inward parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>I was a laughing stock to all my people; their taunting song all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He has filled me with bitterness and made me drunk with wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>He also broke my teeth with gravel; He has covered me with ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>And You cast off my soul from peace; I have forgotten good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>And I said, My strength and my hope from Jehovah are gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>My soul calls to mind and remembers, and it depresses my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'>I recall this to my mind; therefore I hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>Through JehovahÂ’s kindness we are not consumed, because His compassions never fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.23'>They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.24'>Jehovah is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.25'>Jehovah is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.26'>It is good that one should hope for the salvation of Jehovah, even in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.27'>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.28'>He sits alone and keeps silence because He has laid it upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.29'>He puts his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there may be hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.30'>He gives his cheek to Him who strikes him; he is filled full with reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.31'>For the Lord will not cast off forever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.32'>for though He causes grief, yet He will have compassion according to the multitude of His kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.33'>For He does not wish to afflict nor grieve the sons of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.34'>to crush all the prisoners of the earth under His feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.35'>to turn aside the justice due a man before the face of the Most High;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.36'>to pervert a man in his cause; this the Lord does not look after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.37'>Who is he who speaks and it occurs, if the Lord has not commanded it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.38'>From the mouth of the Most High does not come forth both evil and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.39'>Why does a living man complain at the punishment for his sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.40'>Let us search out and examine our ways, and return to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.41'>Let us lift up our heart and hands to the Mighty God in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.42'>We have sinned and have rebelled; You have not forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.43'>You have wrapped Yourself with anger and pursued us; You have slain; You have not spared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.44'>You have wrapped Yourself with a cloud to keep prayer from passing through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.45'>You have made us as the offscouring and garbage in the midst of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.46'>All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.47'>Fear and a pit have come upon us; ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.48'>Streams of water run down my eyes for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.49'>My eyes flow and do not cease, with no stopping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.50'>until Jehovah looks down from Heaven and has regard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.51'>My eye pains my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.52'>My enemies have hunted me down like a bird, without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.53'>They have cut off my life in the pit, and cast a stone upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.54'>Waters flowed over my head; then I said, I am cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.55'>I called on Your name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.56'>You have heard my voice; do not hide Your ear from my relief, from my cry for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.57'>You drew near in the day that I called on You; You said, Fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.58'>O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul; You have redeemed my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.59'>O Jehovah, You have seen how I am wronged; judge my case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.60'>You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.61'>You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their plots against me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.62'>the lips of those who rose up against me, and their scheming against me all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.63'>Behold their sitting down and their rising up; I am their taunting song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.64'>Return upon them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.65'>Give them hardness of heart; Your curse be upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.66'>Pursue and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of Jehovah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.1'>How the gold has become dim; the fine gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.2'>The precious sons of Zion, weighed against refined gold, are counted as earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.3'>Even the monsters draw out the breast to suckle their young. But the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.4'>The tongue of the infant cleaves to the roof of his mouth in thirst; the young children ask for bread; there is none broken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.5'>Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets; those brought up in scarlet embrace refuse heaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.6'>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, with no hands to writhe over her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.7'>Her Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; they were redder of body than rubies; their polishing as sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.8'>Their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it is dried up; it has become like wood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.4.10'>The hands of the compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.11'>Jehovah has fulfilled His fury; He has poured out His fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured its foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.12'>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered the gates into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.13'>For the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, shedding the blood of the just in her midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.14'>they have wandered as blind men in the streets; they are defiled with blood, so that no one could touch their clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.15'>They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart! Do not touch us! When they fled and wandered, they said among the nations, They will not continue to live there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.16'>The face of Jehovah has scattered them out; He will no longer have regard for them; they did not respect the persons of the priests, nor show favor to the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.17'>As for us, our eyes failed, watching in vain for our help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.18'>They have hunted our steps to keep us from going in our streets; our end was near, our days were fulfilled, for our end has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.19'>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they pursued us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.20'>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was captured in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.21'>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who lives in the land of Uz. The cup also shall pass through unto you; you shall become drunk and stripped naked.</verse>
