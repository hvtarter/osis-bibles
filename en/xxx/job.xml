      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and the man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and prepared feasts in their houses, each on his appointed day, and sent and invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>So it was, when the days of feasting had made the rounds, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did over time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have flourished in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>However, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and will he not curse You to Your face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand upon him. So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>and a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>when the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands, rushed in upon the camels and took them away, yea, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell down upon the ground and prostrated himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and he said: Naked I have come from my mothers womb, and naked shall I return there. Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away; blessed is the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Yea, all that a man has he will give for his soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand, but keep his soul alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah, and struck Job with malignant inflammation from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself; and he sat down in the middle of the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. Shall we indeed receive good from God, and shall we not accept adversity? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Jobs three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and show sympathy for him, and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answered, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, A male child has been conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let God above not inquire after it, nor the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud settle on it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let darkness take it away; let it not rejoice among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be barren! Let no joyful shout come into it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let those curse it who curse the day, those who are ready to stir up Leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none, and not see the eyelids of the dawn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>because it did not shut up the doors of my mothers womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not expire when I came forth from the belly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I would have lain down and been quiet, I would have slept; then I would have been at rest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or why was I not concealed like a miscarriage, like infants who never saw the light?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who long for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than hidden treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>who are joyful with exultation, and are glad when they meet the grave;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>or to a man whose way is concealed, whom God has covered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings pour out like waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing I had dreaded with terror has come upon me, and what I had feared has come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for turmoil came.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can restrain words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Surely you have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a word was brought to me by stealth, and my ear received a whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In the uncertainties from the visions of the night, when a man falls into deep sleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>fear and trembling befell me, which made all my bones dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair on my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes in silence; then I heard a voice saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Is mortal man more righteous than God? Is a strong man more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold He puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>even more so those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the grass!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>They are crushed from morning till evening; they perish forever, with no one regarding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their own excellence within them removed? They die, even without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call out now. Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For anger kills a foolish man, and jealousy slays a simple one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His sons are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to rescue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>The hungry eat up his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and a snare snatches their wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring up out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But indeed, I would seek the Mighty God, and before God I would lay out my case;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>who does great things, and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>He gives rain upon the face of the earth, and sends waters abroad;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>He sets the lowly on high, and those who mourn are exalted to safety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot bring about their success;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the twisted is precipitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness by day, and grope at midday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But He saves the needy from the sword, from the mouth of the mighty, and from their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For He bruises, but He binds up; He shatters, but His hands heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver you in six troubles; yea, in seven no evil shall touch you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine He shall redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you shall not be afraid of devastation when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>You shall laugh at devastation and famine, and you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>You shall know that your tent is in peace; you shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You shall also know that your seed shall be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You shall come to the grave in full vigor, as a sheaf of grain springs up in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear and know it for yourself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, and my calamity laid with it on the scales!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild ass bray when it has grass, or does the ox low over its fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can something tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuses to touch them; they are as sickening food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant me the thing that I long for;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>that it would please God to crush me, that He would loose His hand and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then I would still have comfort; though in anguish, I would leap for joy; let Him not spare; for I have not hidden the Words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is my help not within me? And is wisdom driven from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him who is despairing, kindness should be shown by his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers have dealt deceitfully. Like a brook, like the streams of the brooks, they pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>which are dark because of the ice, and into which the snow vanishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>When it is warm, they stop flowing; when it is hot, they dry up from their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their journey are winding; they go into nothingness and vanish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The wanderers of Tema have paid attention; the travelers of Sheba have looked for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They are disappointed because they had been confident, but when they had come there they were abashed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>Surely now you are nothing; you see terror and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I ever say, Bring something to me? Or, Offer a bribe for me from your wealth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will keep silent; cause me to understand in what way I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>Right words are grievous, but what does your rebuke prove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do you intend to rebuke the words and the speeches of one in despair, as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, you throw down the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; for my face will tell if I am lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Turn back, let there be no injustice! Yea, turn back; my righteousness still stands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not warfare for man on earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>Like a servant who pants for the shade, and like a hired man who waits eagerly for his wages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>so I have been allotted months of futility, and restless nights have been appointed to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise from the long night? For I have had my fill of tossing until the twilight of the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods, my skin is hardened and cracked and oozes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle, and are used up without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>O remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never return to see good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>The eye of him who sees me shall watch me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>As the cloud vanishes and goes away, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.10'>He shall never again return to his house, nor shall his place know him anymore.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Grant me this request, and I will speak: I will inquire of You, and You declare to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye has seen You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I despise myself, and have repented in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And so it was, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath has been kindled against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job will pray for you; for I accept him; lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah commanded them; for Jehovah accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And Jehovah returned what had been taken captive from Job when he prayed for his friends. Indeed Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of money and each a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So Jehovah blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren to four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, old and full of days.</verse>
