        <verse osisID='Num.3.38'>And those who were to encamp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons, keeping charge of the sanctuary, to keep the charge of the children of Israel. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.3.39'>All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and above, were twenty-two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.3.40'>And Jehovah said to Moses: Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and above, and take the number of their names.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.3.41'>And you shall take the Levites for Me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.3.42'>So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.3.43'>And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names from a month old and above, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.4.1'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.2'>Take a head count of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.3'>from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.4'>This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, regarding the set apart, holy things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.5'>When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.6'>And they shall put on it a covering of badger skins, and spread over that a cloth entirely of violet; and they shall insert its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.7'>On the table of the Bread of the Presence they shall spread a violet cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the jars for pouring; and the continual bread shall be on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.8'>They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.9'>And they shall take a violet cloth and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all its oil vessels, with which they serve it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.10'>And they shall put it with all its utensils into a covering of badger skins, and put it on a bar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.11'>Over the golden altar they shall spread a violet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.12'>And they shall take all the utensils of service with which they minister in the sanctuary, put them in a violet cloth, cover them with a covering of badger skins, and put them on a bar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.13'>And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.14'>They shall put on it all its implements with which they minister there; the firepans, the forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of badger skins, and insert its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.15'>And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp sets out then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the burdens of the tent of meeting for the sons of Kohath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.16'>The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light, the spiced incense, the continual grain offering, the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.17'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.18'>Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.19'>but do this to them, that they may live and not die when they approach the set apart, holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint each man to his service and his burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.20'>But they shall not go in to watch while the holy things are being covered, that they not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.21'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.22'>Also take a head count of the sons of Gershon, by their fathers house, by their families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.23'>From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who enter to perform the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.24'>This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and the burdens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.25'>They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering, the covering of badger skins that is on it, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.26'>the screen for the door of the gate of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and altar, and their cords, all the furnishings for their service and all that is made for these things: thus shall they serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.27'>At the mouth of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all their burdens and all their service. And you shall assign to them the charge of their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.28'>This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting. And their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.4.32'>and the pillars around the court with their sockets, pegs, and cords, with all their furnishings and all their service; and you shall assign to each man by name the utensils of the charge of his burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.33'>This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service for the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.4.34'>And Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers house,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.5'>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.1'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.2'>Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and everyone who is unclean because of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.3'>You shall send out both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp, that they not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.4'>And the children of Israel did so, and sent them outside the camp; as Jehovah had spoken to Moses, so the children of Israel did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.5'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.6'>Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and that soul is guilty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.7'>then they shall confess the sin which they have done. He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, add a fifth to it, and give it to the one he has wronged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.8'>But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong shall go to Jehovah for the priest, besides the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.9'>Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.10'>And every mans holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.11'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.12'>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If any mans wife turns aside and transgresses in unfaithfulness toward him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.13'>and a man has lain with her with the seed of intercourse, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has been defiled, and there was no witness against her, nor has she been caught;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.14'>if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has been defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not been defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.15'>then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.16'>And the priest shall bring her near, and make her stand before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.17'>The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.18'>And the priest shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, uncover the womans head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in the priests hand shall be the bitter water that brings a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.19'>And the priest shall charge her under oath, and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband, be free from this bitter water that brings a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.20'>But if you have turned aside while under your husband, and if you have been defiled and some man besides your husband has lain with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.21'>then the priest shall charge the woman under the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman: Jehovah make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh waste away and your belly swell;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.22'>and this water that causes the curse shall go into your stomach, and make your belly swell and your thigh waste away. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.23'>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them off into the bitter water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.24'>And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her to become bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.25'>And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the womans hand, shall wave the offering before Jehovah, and bring it to the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.26'>and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar with smoke, and afterward make the woman drink the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.27'>When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has been defiled and transgressed in unfaithfulness toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, her thigh shall waste away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.28'>But if the woman has not been defiled, and is pure, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.29'>This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband, turns aside and has been defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.30'>or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest shall pass all this law upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.5.31'>And the man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.6'>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.1'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.2'>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When either a man or woman makes an extraordinary vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.3'>he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink neither vinegar made from wine nor vinegar made from strong drink; neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.4'>All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced from the grapevine, from seed to skin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.5'>All the days of the vow of his separation no razor shall pass over his head; until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall allow the locks of the hair of his head to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.6'>All the days that he separates himself unto Jehovah he shall not go near a dead person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.7'>He shall not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, for his brother or his sister, at their death, because his consecration unto God is upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.8'>All the days of his separation he shall be holy unto Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.9'>And if in dying anyone dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.10'>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.11'>and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he has sinned regarding the dead person; and he shall consecrate his head that same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.12'>He shall dedicate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and bring a male lamb of the first year as a trespass offering; and the former days are lost, because his separation was defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.13'>And this is the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.14'>And he shall present his offering unto Jehovah: one male lamb of the first year that is whole as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb of the first year that is whole as a sin offering, one ram that is whole as a peace offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.15'>a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their grain offering with their drink offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.16'>And the priest shall bring them before Jehovah and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.17'>and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall also offer its grain offering and its drink offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.18'>And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.19'>And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated hair,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.20'>and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah; they are holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering. Afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.21'>This is the law of the Nazirite who vows unto Jehovah the offering for his separation, and besides that, whatever his hand is able to afford; according to the vow which he vows, thus he shall do according to the law of his separation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.22'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.23'>Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, In this manner you shall bless the children of Israel. Say unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.24'>Jehovah bless you and keep you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.25'>Jehovah make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.26'>Jehovah lift up His presence upon you, and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.6.27'>Thus they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.7'>
        <verse osisID='Num.7.1'>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; thus he anointed them and consecrated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.7.2'>And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and over those who were numbered, brought offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.7.3'>And they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.7.4'>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
