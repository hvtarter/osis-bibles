      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any affliction, through the comfort by which we ourselves are encouraged by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Now if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, being effective in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are encouraged, it is for your comfort and salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened exceedingly, beyond strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us, in whom we hope that He will still deliver us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given through many persons on our behalf for the gracious gift granted to us by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. And I hope you will understand, even to the end</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your rejoicing as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before now, that you might have a second benefit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>to journey on through you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be sent by you on towards Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us; through me, Silvanus, and Timothy; was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For as many promises as are of God, in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, unto the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also has sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers of your joy; for by faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing to you, that, when I came, I should not have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you should be sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part; that I may not be overbearing on everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>This punishment from the majority is sufficient for such a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and encourage him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I encourage you to confirm your love to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one through you in the person of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>so that Satan should not take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach ChristÂ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us manifests the aroma of His knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ, in the sight of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some others, letters of commendation to you or commendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read by all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>Clearly you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but in tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And we have such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being out of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministry of death, written and engraved in stone, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which was passing away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how much will not the ministry of the Spirit be more glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, even more the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if what is passing away was glorious, much more what remains is glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore, since we have such hope, we use much boldness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Covenant, which is being done away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every manÂ’s conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But also if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for JesusÂ’ sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For it is God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always delivered to death because of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death is working in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I believe and therefore I speak, we also believe and therefore speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things are for you, that the grace may excel through the greater numbers, and cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not faint. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is achieving for us a surpassing and eternal weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we do not contemplate the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling place out of Heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now He who has fashioned us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>For we walk by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are confident, yes, preferring rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we strive, whether at home or away, to be well pleasing to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are well known to God, and I also hope are well known in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to rejoice on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ holds us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and He died for all, that those who live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>Now all things are from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the Word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. As God is exhorting through us, we beseech you on ChristÂ’s behalf, Be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We then, as workers together with Him, also beseech you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For He says: In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Giving no cause of stumbling in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>But in all things commending ourselves as ministers of God; in much endurance, in afflictions, in needs, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in the Word of Truth, in the power of God, through the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is wide open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be wide open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore, Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not say this to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my rejoicing on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside were fightings, inside were fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless God, who encourages the downcast, encouraged us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was encouraged in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the letter made you sorry, even if for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry unto repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vengeance! In all things you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Therefore, although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we have been encouraged in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if in anything I have exulted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our exulting to Titus was found true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>imploring us with much entreating that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and also to us through the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace among you as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you abound in everything (in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us), see that you abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love through the diligence of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give advice: It is profitable for you not only to be doing what you began and were intending to do a year ago;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was an eagerness to purpose it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if something is presented eagerly, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack; that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For indeed he accepted the exhortation, and being more earnest, he went to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and your ready mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>avoiding this: that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is administered by us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>providing honorable things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which we have in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our exulting on your behalf.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>for I know your willingness, about which I exult of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I have sent the brethren, that our exulting of you should not be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed in this confident exulting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your bounty beforehand, which you had previously announced, that it may be ready as a blessing and not as greed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not from sorrow or out of duty; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>As it is written: He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>while you are enriched in everything unto all sincerity, which causes thanksgiving through us to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the ministry of this service not only supplies what is lacking to the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for your professed obedience to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and fairness of Christ; who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I beseech you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I figure on being bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God for pulling down strongholds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity unto the obedience of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and being ready to avenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is ChristÂ’s, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is ChristÂ’s, even so we are ChristÂ’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>so that I may not seem to frighten you by letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word through letters when we are absent, such we are also in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God distributed to us; a measure which reaches even unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overextending ourselves (as though not extending to you), for we also came as far as to you with the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other menÂ’s labors, but having hope, that as your faith is growing, according to our rule, being greatly enlarged to overflowing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>in order to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in anotherÂ’s measure of accomplishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>Oh, that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, and indeed bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted; you may well put up with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>Even though I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but have been fully exposed to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you freely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked, the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this exulting in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, let no one think me to be foolish. Otherwise if not, at least receive me as being foolish, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you put up with fools gladly, since you are wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you endure if someone brings you into bondage, if someone devours you, if someone takes from you, if someone exalts himself, if someone strikes you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak in dishonor, as though we had been weak. But in whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I excel them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in hardship and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>besides the other things, that come upon me daily: the care of each of the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must boast, I will boast of the things of my infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, intending to arrest me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>It is really not profitable for me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows); such a one was caught up to the third Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows);</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>how he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Of such a one I will exult; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For though I might desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, that no one should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And so that I should not be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I should not be made haughty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this thing I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most gladly I will rather exult in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for ChristÂ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become foolish in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Now the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do you think that we defend ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, evil speakings, whisperings, conceits, commotions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>that it not be, when I come again, that my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, sexual perversities, and licentiousness which they have practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This will be the third time I am coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For though He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know, yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you; unless indeed you are ones failing the test?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I hope that you will know that we are not ones failing the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear acceptable, but that you should do what is honorable, even though we may seem to be unacceptable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we have no power against the truth, but on behalf of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore I write these things being absent, that when present I should not use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for pulling down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally, brethren, rejoice. Become complete. Be encouraged, be of one mind, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</verse>
