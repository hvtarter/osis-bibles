      <chapter osisID='Zeph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.1'>The Word of Jehovah which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.2'>I will gather up and make an end of all things from off the face of the land, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.3'>I will gather away man and beast: I will gather away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks, even the wicked. And I will cut off man from the face of the land, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>I will also stretch out My hand on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the names of the idolatrous priests, with the priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>and those who bow down to the host of the heavens on the housetops; and those who bow, swearing to Jehovah, but also swearing by Melech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>and those drawing back from following Jehovah, and who have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Be silent in the presence of the Lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is near. For Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated the ones He called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>And it shall come to pass in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah, that I will punish the rulers and the kings sons, and all those clothed in foreign apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>And I will punish all those who leap on the threshold in that day, who fill their masters houses with violence and deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>And it shall be in that day, declares Jehovah, the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, and a howling from the Second, and a loud crashing from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people have perished; all those who carry silver are cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men who are curdled in their dregs; who say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, nor will He do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation. They shall also build houses, but not live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>The great day of Jehovah is near; it is near and hastens greatly, the sound of the day of Jehovah. The mighty man shall cry out bitterly there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of desolation and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>a day of the shofar and alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against Jehovah. And their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh like dung.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.18'>Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah. But all the earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy. For He shall make a complete and speedy end of all those who live in the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Gather yourselves, yes gather together, O nation not desired;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>before the decree is brought forth, the day shall pass like the chaff, yet not before the hot anger of Jehovah comes upon you, yet not before the day of the anger of Jehovah comes upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek Jehovah, all the meek of the earth who have done His justice; seek righteousness; seek meekness. It may be that you shall be hidden in the day of the anger of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They shall drive Ashdod out at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The Word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; I will destroy you so that there shall not be an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.6'>And the seacoast shall be meadows, cottages for shepherds, and folds for the flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed on them. In the houses of Ashkelon, they shall lie down in the evening, for Jehovah their God shall visit them and return their captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, with which they have reproached My people and have magnified themselves against their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>Therefore, as I live, declares Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a desolation forever. The rest of My people shall plunder them, and the remnant of the nation shall possess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>They shall have this for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>Jehovah will be terrifying to them, for He will make lean all the gods of the earth. Each man from his place and all the islands of the nations will bow to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>You also, O Ethiopians, shall be slain by My sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>And He will stretch out His hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, dry like the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.14'>And flocks shall lie down in her midst; all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the capitals of its pillars. Their voice shall sing at the windows; desolation shall be at the threshold; for He will lay bare the cedar work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>This is the joyous city, that dwelt confidently, who said in her heart, I am, and there is no other. How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down. Everyone who passes near her shall hiss; he shall shake his hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She did not give heed to the voice; she did not receive correction; she did not trust in Jehovah; she did not draw near to her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her rulers within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, that do not leave the bones till the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets are wanton, treacherous people; her priests have profaned the sanctuary; they have done violence to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>The righteous Jehovah is in her midst; He will do no wrong. Every morning He gives His justice to the light; He does not fail, but the unjust knows no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>I have cut off nations; their towers are desolate. I made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are laid waste, without a man, with no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>I said, Surely you will fear Me; you will receive instruction; so that her dwelling should not be cut off, all that I appointed for her. But they rose up early; they corrupted all their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.8'>Therefore, wait for Me, declares Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey. For My judgment is to gather the nations, for Me to gather the kingdoms, to pour My fury out on them, all My burning anger. For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>For then I will transform to the peoples a pure language, to call on the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.10'>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My suppliants, the daughter of My scattered ones, shall bring My offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.11'>In that day you shall not be ashamed for all your doings which you have transgressed against Me. For then I will take away out of your midst those who rejoice in your pride, and you shall not again be haughty any more in My holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.12'>I will also leave a poor and weak people in your midst, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.13'>The remnant of Israel shall not do injustice, nor speak lies. And a deceitful tongue shall not be found in their mouth. For they shall feed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.14'>Cry aloud for joy, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.15'>Jehovah has taken away your judgments; He has turned away your enemy. Jehovah, the King of Israel, is in your midst; you shall not see evil any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.16'>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not, Zion. Do not let your hands be weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.17'>Jehovah your God is mighty in your midst; He will save. He will rejoice over you with joy; He will quiet you in His love. He rejoices over you with joyful praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.18'>I will gather the afflicted ones from the appointed place; they were among you, an utterance of reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.19'>Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you. And I will save her who is lame, and gather her who was banished. And I will appoint them for praise and for renown in all the lands where they have been put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.20'>At that time I will bring you back, even at the time that I gather you. For I will give you for renown and for praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I return your captives before your eyes, says Jehovah.</verse>
