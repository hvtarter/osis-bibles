      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said: Jehovah will roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem. And the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall dry up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they have threshed Gilead with implements of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>But I will send a fire against the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will also break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden. And the people of Syria shall go captive to Kir, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they took captive all the captives to deliver them up to prison in Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>But I will send a fire against the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the inhabitants of Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; and I will turn My hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they delivered up all the captives to Edom and did not remember the covenant of brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>But I will send a fire against the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for he pursued his brother with the sword, and dealt corruptly regarding mercy, and his anger tore continually, and he kept his wrath forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>But I will send a fire against Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, that they might make their border larger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah, which shall devour its palaces, with a war cry in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the windstorm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his rulers together, says Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>But I will send a fire against Moab, which shall devour the palaces of Kerioth. And Moab shall die with uproar, with a war cry, and with the sound of the shofar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the judge in its midst, and will kill all its rulers with him, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it; for they despised the Law of Jehovah, and they have not kept His statutes. And their lies after which their fathers walked led them astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>And I will send a fire against Judah, which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the helpless, and thrust aside the way of the afflicted. And a man and his father go in to the same girl, in order to profane My holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge, and drink the wine of those being punished in the house of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you in the wilderness forty years, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Is this not even so, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and you commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart full of sheaves is pressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>Therefore flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his power, nor shall the mighty deliver his life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>and he who handles the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, nor shall the one riding a horse deliver his soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>And the strong of heart among the mighty shall flee naked in that day, declares Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this Word that Jehovah has spoken against you, O sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only have I known of all the families of the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Can two walk together except they are agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught something?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground, where there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and it has caught nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>If a shofar is blown in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is calamity in a city, will not even Jehovah have done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken! Who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Proclaim in the palaces in Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see great tumults in its midst, and oppressions in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they do not know to do right, declares Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy shall be all around the land. And he shall bring down your strength from you, and your fortresses shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus says Jehovah, As the shepherd snatches two legs out of the mouth of the lion, or a piece of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be snatched, those who dwell in Samaria in a corner of a bed, and in Damascus on a couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear and testify in the house of Jacob, declares the Lord Jehovah the God of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>For in the day that I punish the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also attend to the altars of Bethel. And the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will strike the winter house along with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall come to an end, declares Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who are in the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their husbands, Bring in, that we may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by His holiness that the days are coming that He will carry you away with meat hooks, and the last of you with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And you shall go out at the breaches, each woman before her; and you shall be cast into the high fortress, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Bethel and transgress; multiply transgression at Gilgal; and bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every third year;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven; cry out, call out the free-will offerings! For so you love to do, O sons of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places; and you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And I have also withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One parcel of land was rained on, and the parcel where it did not rain was dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities staggered to one city in order to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have struck you with blasting and mildew. When your gardens and your vineyards, and your figs, and your olives increased, the locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent a plague among you in the manner of Egypt; I have killed your young men with the sword, along with your captive horses. And I have made the stench of your camps come up into your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand plucked out of the burning; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore I will do this to you, O Israel: Because of this that I will do to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind and declares to man what his thought is, He who makes the dawn darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth; Jehovah the God of Hosts, is His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear this word which I am taking up against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel has fallen, and will not rise again; she lies forsaken on her land; there is no one to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah, The city that goes out by a thousand shall have a hundred left. And that which goes out by a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek Me, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But do not seek Bethel, and do not enter Gilgal, and do not cross over to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall be exiled into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek Jehovah, and live, that He not break out like a fire on the house of Joseph, and consume it, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>you who turn justice into wormwood, and lay righteousness to rest on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the deep darkness into morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth, Jehovah is His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>who bursts out with destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>So, therefore because you trample on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him; you have built houses of hewn stones, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know your many transgressions, and your many sins: afflicting the just, taking bribes, and thrusting away the poor from justice in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore the prudent shall keep silent at that time, for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and thus Jehovah the God of Hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah the God of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore Jehovah the God of Hosts, the Lord, says this: There shall be wailing in all the streets, and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the farmer to the mourning, and those that are skilled in wailing to lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And there shall be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah! Of what good is this to you? The day of Jehovah is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>It is as if a man fled before a lion, and a bear met him. Or he goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, and a snake bites him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Is not the day of Jehovah darkness, and not light; even very dark, and not any brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feast days; and I will not savor your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not be pleased; nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take away from Me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your lutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice flow down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Have you drawn near with sacrifices and food offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>Indeed, you have borne the tabernacle of your king, and Chiun your images, the star of your gods, which you made for yourselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore I will exile you beyond Damascus, says Jehovah, whose name is God of Hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those at ease in Zion, and those trusting in the mountain of Samaria, noted as chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Cross over to Calneh and see; and from there go to the great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, or their border than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>who lie on beds of ivory and stretch themselves on their couches; and those eating the lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>who chant with the sound of the lute; they invent instruments of song for themselves like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>who drink wine from bowls, and anoint themselves with the best of ointments; but they are not grieved for the crushing of Joseph!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore they shall go into captivity with the first of the captives, and the feast of those who recline shall come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, declares Jehovah the God of Hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore I will deliver up the city and its fullness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall come to pass, if ten men remain in one house, that they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And when a mans uncle shall take him away, and he who burns the bodies, to bring out the bones from the house; and he shall say to the one left in the recesses of the house, Are there any still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Keep quiet! For we must not mention the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, Jehovah gives a command, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house with cracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run on the rock? Or will one plow there with oxen? For you have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>those rejoicing for nothing; who say, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>For, behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, declares Jehovah the God of Hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the valley of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, He formed locusts at the beginning of the after growth; indeed, the after growth after the mowings of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And so it was that when they had made an end of eating the vegetation of the land, then I said, Lord Jehovah, I pray, forgive. How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and devoured part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then I said, Lord Jehovah, I beg You, stop. How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>He showed me this: And, behold, the Lord stood by a plumb lined wall, with a plumb line in His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And Jehovah said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. Then the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, the king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be exiled into captivity out of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>And Amaziah said to Amos, Seer, go! Flee into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But do not again prophesy at Bethel any more, for it is the kings sanctuary, and it is the royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was not a prophet, nor was I the son of a prophet, but I was a herdsman and one gathering sycamore fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>And Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now, therefore, hear the Word of Jehovah: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop words against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus says Jehovah, Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a survey line. And you shall die in a defiled land. And Israel shall be exiled into captivity from his land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. And Jehovah said to me, The end has come upon My people Israel; I will not again pass over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple will be howling in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. Many dead bodies everywhere; and they shall throw them out in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, you who swallow up the needy, and make the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>saying, When will the new moon have passed, so that we may buy grain? Or the sabbath, so that we may open the wheat; making the ephah smaller, and making the shekel greater, and falsifying the balances by deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.6'>in order to buy the poor with silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.7'>Jehovah has sworn by the Pride of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.1'>I saw the Lord standing by the altar. And He said, Strike the capital of the door, and the thresholds will shake; and cut them off on the head of all of them. And I will kill the last of them with the sword. Not one of them who flees will get away, and not a fugitive of them will escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'>Even if they dig through into Sheol, from there My hand will take them. And if they ascend up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there. Even if they hide from My eyes in the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and he will bite them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.4'>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. And I will set My eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.5'>And the Lord Jehovah of Hosts is He who touches the earth so that it melts, and all who dwell in it shall mourn. And all of it will rise up like the River, and sink down like the River of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>He who builds His stairs in the heavens, and His firmament He has established, binding it to the earth; He who calls for the seawaters and pours them out on the face of the earth; Jehovah is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'>Are you not like the sons of Cush to Me, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah. Have I not brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth; except that, I will not utterly annihilate the house of Jacob, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.9'>For, behold, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one sifts with a sieve; yet not a grain shall fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.10'>All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, those who say, The evil shall not draw near or come upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.11'>In that day I will raise up the covert of David that has fallen, and I will wall up its breaks. And I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.12'>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.13'>Behold, the days are coming, declares Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who drags along seed. And the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.14'>And I will bring back the captives of My people Israel. And they shall build the waste cities, and live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them. They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.15'>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be pulled up out of their land which I have given to them, says Jehovah your God.</verse>
