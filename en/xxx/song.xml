        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, your name is ointment poured forth; therefore the virgins love you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>I am black, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Do not look upon me, because I am black, because the sun has looked upon me. My mothers sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>To Her Beloved: Tell me, O you whom I love, where you feed your flock, where you make it rest at noon. For why should I be as one who veils herself by the flocks of your companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>The Beloved: If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the footsteps of the flock, and feed your young goats beside the tents of the shepherds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.3'>Shulamite: Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down in his shade with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.8'>Shulamite: The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he stands behind our wall; he is looking through the windows, gazing through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke, and said to me: Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.12'>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>The fig tree ripens her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the cliff, let me see your form, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your appearance is beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Her Brothers: Catch us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>Shulamite: My beloved is mine, and I am his. He grazes among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>To Her Beloved: Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.3'>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.1'>Shulamite: By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.2'>I will rise now, and go about the city; in the streets and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen who go about the city found me and I said, Have you seen him whom my soul loves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>Scarcely had I passed by them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I took hold of him and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mothers house, and into the room of her who conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.6'>Shulamite: Who is this coming out of the wilderness like columns of smoke, like the smoke of sacrifices of myrrh and frankincense, of all the fragrant powders of the merchant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.7'>Behold, it is Solomons bed, with sixty mighty men around it, of the mighty of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>They all hold swords, being expert in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh because of fear in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>King Solomon made himself a palanquin from trees of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made its pillars of silver, its support of gold, its seat of purple; its interior paved with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day, the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>The Beloved: Behold, you are beautiful, my love! Behold, you are beautiful! You have doves eyes behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats lying down at Mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep which have come up from the washing, every one of which bears twins, and none is barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Your lips are like a strand of scarlet, and your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no defect in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one look of your eyes, with the pendant around your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How beautiful is your love, My sister, my spouse! How much better than wine is your love, and the scent of your ointments than all spices!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>The Beloved: I have come to my garden, my sister, my spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. To His Friends: Eat, O friends! Drink, yes, get drunk, O beloved ones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>Shulamite: I sleep, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my beloved! He knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is covered with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have stripped off my gown; how shall I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how shall I dirty them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: If you find my beloved, that you tell him I am lovesick!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>Daughters of Jerusalem: What is your beloved more than any other beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than any other beloved, that you charge us so?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>But my dove, my perfect one, is the one, the only one of her mother, the pure of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her and called her blessed, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>Shulamite: I went down to the garden of nuts to see the greenery of the valley, to see whether the vine had budded and the pomegranates had bloomed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>The Beloved and His Friends: Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may gaze upon you! Shulamite: What would you see in the Shulamite; as it were, the dancing of two armies?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>The Beloved: How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O princes daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilled artist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Your navel is like a round goblet; it lacks no mixed wine. Your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Your neck is like an ivory tower, your eyes like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts like its clusters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will go up into the palm tree, I will grasp its stalk. Let now your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your nose like apples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>and the roof of your mouth like excellent wine. Shulamite: The wine goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding gently over the lips into sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloveds, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine has budded, whether the grape blossoms are open, and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give my love to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>At our door all manner of excellent fragrances for love, new and old, I have treasured up for you, my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>Oh, that you were like my brother, who nursed at my mothers breasts! If I should find you outside, I would kiss you; I would not be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead you and bring you into my mothers house, to teach me; I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.3'>To the Daughters of Jerusalem: His left hand under my head, and his right hand embracing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.4'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.5'>A Relative: Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree. There your mother travailed with you; there she travailed with you and bore you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Shulamite to Her Beloved: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as Sheol; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of YAH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, nor can the rivers overflow it. If a man would give for love all the wealth of his house, it would be despised with contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>Relatives: We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she is a wall, we will build upon her a battlement of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
