        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The Elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly because I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many corrupters have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a corrupter and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we have produced, but that we may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor speak a blessing to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who blesses him shares in his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
