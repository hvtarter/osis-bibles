      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow laborer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of your faith may become active in the full true knowledge of every good thing in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and encouragement in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to order you to do what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for loveÂ’s sake I rather appeal to you; being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was worthless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave but more than a slave; a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>And if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay; not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
