      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob;  Jacob, of Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah (by Tamar), of Perez and Zerah; Perez, of Hezron; Hezron, of Ram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Ram, of Amminadab; Amminadab, of Nahshon; Nahshon, of Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon (by Rahab), of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth), of Obed; Obed, of Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse, of David the king. David (by Uriahs widow), was the father of Solomon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon, of Rehoboam; Rehoboam, of Abijah; Abijah, of Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa, of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat, of Joram; Joram, of Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah, of Jotham; Jotham, of Ahaz; Ahaz, of Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah, of Manasseh; Manasseh, of Amon; Amon, of Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah, of Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the carrying away into Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel, of Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel, of Abiud; Abiud, of Eliakim; Eliakim, of Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor, of Sadoc; Sadoc, of Achim; Achim, of Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud, of Eleazar; Eleazar, of Matthan; Matthan, of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob, of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,  who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the exile to Babylon is fourteen; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ is fourteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. After his mother,  Mary, had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Joseph her husband, because he was just a man and unwilling to disgrace her, was minded to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>And while he was having this in mind, behold! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home,  for what is begotten in her is by the Holy Spirit; and she will bear a son, and you are to call him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All this happened that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold! the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son; and they shall call his name Immanuel, a word which means "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Now when Joseph awoke from his sleep he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him, and took his wife home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but did not live with her until after the birth of her son, whom he called Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>After the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judea,  during the reign of King Herod, lo! certain Magi arrived in Jerusalem, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>"Where is the new-born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>So when he had gathered together all the chief priests and rabbis of the people, he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they told him. "At Bethlehem in Judea, as it is written in the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, Thou are not least among the princes of Judah, For out of thee shall come a ruler Who shall shepherd my people, Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Thereupon Herod sent secretly for the Magi, and found out from them the time when the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and as soon as you have found him bring me word,  that I, too, may go and worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>The Magi listened to the king, and went on their way, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east led them until it came and stood over the place where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with great gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>When they had entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and opening their treasure-chests they gave him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>But because they were forbidden by God in a dream to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>When they were gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying; "Rise! Take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and there remain until I bring you word; for Herod intends to make a search for the child, in order to put him to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, by night, and departed to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>There he remained until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>As soon as Herod saw that he had been mocked by the Magi, he was furious. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and all the neighborhood who were two years old or under, in accordance with the date which he had ascertained from the Magi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then were fulfilled the words spoken through Jeremiah, the prophet,  saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and lamentation- Rachel weeping for her children, Inconsolable, because they were no more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But after Herods death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, "Rise! Take the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>So he rose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into Galilee and settled in a town called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>in fulfillment of the word spoken through the Prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>"Repent," said he, "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>This Johnit was of whom it was said through Isaiah, the prophet, The voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, "Prepare a way for the Lord, Make the paths straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>This Johnwore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem began to go out to him, and all Judea, and the whole neighborhood of the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when Johnsaw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for baptism, he said. "O brood of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Then bring forth fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father-I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And already the axe is lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree,  therefore, that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed am baptizing you in water, unto repentance; but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing-floor. He will store his wheat in the granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>At that very time Jesus was on his way from Galilee to the Jordan,  to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But he tried to prevent him. "It is I," he said, "who need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to fulfill every religious duty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Then he consented. And after Jesus was baptized, as soon as he rose out of the water, lo! the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>while a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, the beloved, In whom I delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the desert by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he became hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>So the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, bid these stones to become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>Jesus answered him, "It is written, Not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him up into the Holy City and stood him on the parapet of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him. "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;  for it is written, "He will give his angels charge over thee; Upon their hands they will bear thee up, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>"It is written again," answered Jesus, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Then the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and showed all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, "All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>"Begone, Satan!" answered Jesus, "for it is written, "Thou must worship the Lord thy God, and Him only must thou serve."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold! angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that Johnhad been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>He left Nazareth, and settled in Capernaum-by-the-Lake, near the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>in order that these words spoken through Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali; The road by the Lake; the country beyond Jordan; Galilee of the Gentiles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who were dwelling in darkness Have seen a great light;  And on those who were dwelling in the land of the shadows of death Light has dawned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And as he was walking by the see of Galilee, he saw two brothers-  Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother-casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "And I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they dropped their nets at once, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>As he went farther on he saw two other brothers, Jamesthe son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father,  mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Then Jesus went about through Galilee, teaching in the synagogues,  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame spread throughout all Syria. They brought all the sick to him, those who were suffering from various diseases and troubles-  demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics-and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Great crowds followed him from Galilee, from the ten towns, from Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and when he had seated himself, his disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and opening his lips he began to teach them, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>"Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>"Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my names sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>"Rejoice and exult in it, because your reward was great in the heavens; for so did they persecute the prophets before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt lose its savor, in what way shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hilltop cannot be hid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>"nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>"So let your light shine before men that they may see good you do,  and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Do not suppose that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>"In solemn truth I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a comma, will pass from the Law until all has taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>"So whoever breaks one of these least commandments, and teaches others to break them, will be least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who keeps them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>"For I assure you that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not find entrance into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Thou shall not commit murder, and "he who commits murder shall be liable to condemnation by the court;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>but I say to you that he who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to condemnation by the court; and he who says to his brother Raca, shall be liable to condemnation by the Sanhedrin, while he who curses his brother shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>"If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>"leave there your gift before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother, first of all; then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>"Come to terms with your opponent quickly, while you are yet with him on the way to the court, to prevent your opponent from handing you over to the judge, and the judge to the jailer, and so you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>"I tell you truly that you would certainly not get out from there until you had paid back the last cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your eye, your right eye, entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs, than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand entices you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs,  than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"It was also said, "Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of separation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries her when so divorced, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You must not forswear yourselves, but must perform your vows to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>"But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by the sky, for it is Gods throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>"Nor must you swear by your head, since you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>"But let your word be simply Yes or No;anything beyond this comes from the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>"But I tell you not to retaliate the injury; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>"and if any one wants to go to law with you and takes away your coat, let him take your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>"Whoever impresses you to go one mile, go two miles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>"Give to him who asks, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>"But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>"So you will become sons of your heavenly Father; for he makes his sun to rise upon sinners as well as saints, and sends rain upon the unjust and the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>"For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>"Even the tax-gatherers do that, do they not? And if you show courtesy to your brother only, what are you doing more than others?  Even the Gentiles do that, do they not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>"You then must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>"Be careful not to do your good deeds in the sight of men, in order to be observed by them. If you do, you have no reward with your heavenly Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>"And whatever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets, in order that men may praise them. In solemn truth I tell you they already have their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>"But when you give alms, do not let your right hand know what your left is doing,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>because Johnkept telling him, "It is not right for you to have her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And although he wished to kill John, he feared the people, for they considered Johna prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herods birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>and so pleased Herod that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>So, prompted by her mother, the girl said, "Give me at once, upon a dish, the head of Johnthe Baptist."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.9'>The king was displeased because of this, but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>Then Johns disciples went and removed his body, and came and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>When Jesus heard it he went away privately by boat to a lonely spot;  but the crowds heard about it, and followed him on foot from the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>So when he landed he saw a great multitude, and felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>As twilight fell, his disciples came to him and said. "This is a lonely spot, and the day is far spent; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>"They need not go away," said Jesus, "do you, yourselves, give them something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>"We have nothing here," they replied, "except five loaves and two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>"Bring them here to me," said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>Then he told the people to sit down on the grass, and after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and handed them to the disciples, and the disciples handed them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>And they all ate and were fully satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Then he made his disciples get aboard the boat and precede him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>After he had sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain alone, to pray. When night came he was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>But the boat was already a long way from shore, buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>And in the fourth watch of the night he came toward them, walking upon the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>but when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were terrified. "It is a phantom," they said, and cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But at once Jesus spoke to them, "Courage," he said, "it is I. Fear not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>Peter answered, "Master, if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.29'>"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, "Master, save me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, saying to him. "O little faith! What made you doubt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>Then as they climbed into the boat the wind grew weary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>and the men in the boat fell upon their knees before him, saying,  "You are, indeed, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>Then they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>and when the men of that country recognized him, they sent into all the country round about, and brought to him all the sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.36'>and kept begging him to let them touch the tassel of his cloak - and all who touched were completely cured.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and in order to test him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>And behold! Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>Then Peter said to Jesus. "Master, it is good that we are here! If you are willing I will make here three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>It came about after Jesus had finished these teachings, that he removed from Galilee, and went to that part of Judea which lay across the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>A great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>Presently some of the Pharisees came up to him, and made test of him by asking, "Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>"Have you not read." he answered, "that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>"Thus they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They answered, "Why then did Moses command the husband to give her a written bill of divorce, and so to put her away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>"Moses," said Jesus, "permitted you to divorce your wives on account of the hardness of your hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>"And I tell you that any man who divorces his wife for any cause except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>"If that is the position of a man in relation to his wife," answered the disciples, "it is better not to marry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>He answered them. "Not all are accepting this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>"For there are eunuchs who have been such from birth; others who have been made such by men; and others who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then young children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples interfered, but Jesus said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>"Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>So he laid his hands upon them, and departed from that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>But look! a certain man came up to him and asked, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>"Why do you ask me about what is good?" asked Jesus. "There is but One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>"Which commandments?" asked the man. Jesus replied. "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>"Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man answered. "I have carefully kept them all. What yet do I lack?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>"If you want to be perfect," said Jesus, "go, sell your property,  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,  follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>But when the young man heard this teaching, he went away sorrowful,  for he was one who had much property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>So Jesus said to his disciples. "In solemn truth I tell you that a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>"I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>When they heard this the disciples were utterly astounded. "Who then can be saved?" they exclaimed. Jesus looked at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>"With men this is impossible," he said, "but with God all things are possible."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Whereupon Peter said to Jesus. "Look, Master, we have forsaken everything and followed you. Now what shall be our reward?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>"In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus answered, "that in the New Creation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,  you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>"And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall many times as much, and fall heir to eternal life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>"When he went out about five oclock, he found others standing around, and said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle, all the day long?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.10'>"and when the first came they supposed that they would get more, but they also received each two shillings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>"And as they took it they began to grumble against the master of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>"Those last men, they said, have toiled only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the burning heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.13'>"In reply he said to one of them. My friend, I am doing no wrong.  Did you not agree with me for two shillings?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.16'>"So the last shall be first, and the first, last."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside by themselves, and as they went he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.18'>"Look! We are on the way up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.20'>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons,  kneeling down and begging a favor of him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.22'>"None of you indeed shall drink," he answered, "but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.24'>When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.25'>but Jesus called them to him and said. "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.32'>Then Jesus stopped and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.33'>"Master," they answered, "let our eyes be opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and they saw at once, and followed him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>And when they approached Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>"Go on into the village facing you, and at once you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her. Loose them and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>"And if any one says anything to you, tell him, The Master needs them, and he will send them without delay."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>This happened in fulfilment of the word spoken though the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold thy King cometh to thee, Gentle and sitting upon an ass, And upon a colt, the fool of a beast of burden."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>So the disciples went and did as Jesus told them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>they led back the ass and her colt, and placed their cloaks on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Then Jesus seated himself upon them, and most of the crowd kept spreading their cloaks on the road, and others began cutting branches off the trees, and spreading them in the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>And the crowds who preceded and those who followed after him shouted again and again, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>And as he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. "Who is this?" they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>And the crowds answered, "This is the Prophet Jesus, from Nazareth,  in Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Then Jesus entered into the Temple courts, and cast out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the tables of the money-  changers, and the seats of those who sold pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>"It is written," he said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of thieves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Then the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple courts, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But when the chief priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful works he did, and the boys who were shouting in the Temple Courts and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>they asked him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" "Surely," said Jesus, "and have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>So he left them and went outside the city, to Bethany, and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>At dawn, when he was on his way back into the city, he was hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and when he saw a solitary fig tree beside the road, he went to it,  but found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "Let no man gather fruit from you forever." And at once the fig tree withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>When his disciples saw this, they were astonished. "How instantaneously," they said, "the fig tree withered!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>In reply Jesus said to them, "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Up, cast yourself into the sea! it shall be done;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>When he had entered the Temple courts, and was teaching, the high priests and elders of the people came to him and asked him, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answered. "I also will put a question to you, which, if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Johns baptism, whence was it, from heaven or from man?" So they began debating about it among themselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He said to them, "Nor am I going to tell you in what authority I do these deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>"But give me your judgment. There was once a man who had two sons.  He went to the first and said to him, "Son, go work today in my vineyard!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>"I will go, sir, he answered; yet he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>"Then he went to the second, and said the same thing to him. "I will not, he answered; but afterward he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>"Which of these two did the will of his father?" "The last," they replied. "I tell you truly," said Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and harlots are going into the kingdom of heaven before you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>"For Johncame to you in the road of righteousness, and you did not give credence to him; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots gave credence to him. But you, although you saw this, did not even then change your minds and give credence to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>"Listen to another parable. "A man who was a householder planted a vineyard, fenced it about, dug a wine vat in it, built a tower, then rented it to vine-dressers and went abroad.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>"And last he sent his son to them; Surely they will respect my son, he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>"But when the vine-dressers saw his son, they said to themselves.  "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>"So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>"When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>"He will utterly destroy those wretches," they answered, "and will entrust his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will pay back the fruits to him in their season."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>"Have you never read in the Scriptures," Jesus answered, "how The stone that the builders rejected Has been made the corner-stone; This is the Lords doing, It is wonderful in our eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>"I tell you that for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation that does produce the fruit of it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Once more Jesus answered them in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>"The kingdom of heaven," he said, "may be compared to a king who made a wedding-feast for his son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>"Again he sent out other slaves. Tell the invited guests, he said,  that my luncheon is now ready; my oxen and fat cattle are killed;  everything is ready; come to the wedding-feast.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>"while the rest seized his slaves and maltreated and murdered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>"Then the kings wrath was roused, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>"Then he said to his slaves, "The wedding-feast indeed is ready,  but the invited guests were not worthy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>"So those slaves went out into the roads, and gathered together all whom they found, good or bad, and the banquet-hall was filled with the guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>"Then the king came in to inspect his guests, and he discovered there a man who had not put on a wedding-garment. He said to him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>"For there are many called, but few are chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him during conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>So they sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians. "Teacher,"  they said, "we know that you are honest, and that you are teaching the way of God in sincerity; and are not afraid of any one, for you do not court mens favor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>"Hypocrites! Why are you tempting me? Show me the tribute money." So they brought him a shilling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>"Whose likeness and inscription is this?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>"Caesars," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>When they heard this they were astonished, and left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>That very day there came to him some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. and they questioned him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>"The Son of man is indeed to go as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were good for that man if he had never been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>In answer, Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Surely it is not I,  Rabbi?" He said to him, "Is it not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and, when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And when he had taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them,  saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the Covenant,  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>"But I say to you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>So after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them. "This very night even you will all stumble and fall away from me; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd,  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>"If they all stumble and fall away from you," answered Peter, "I will never do so!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, "In solemn truth I tell you that on this very night, before cockcrow, you will deny me three times!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>But Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And so said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit down here, while I go and pray yonder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be in anguish and sore distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>and he said to them. "My soul is an anguish, even unto death! Stay here, and keep watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Then he went forward a short distance, and fell on his face and prayed. "O, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;  nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter. "So you were none of you strong enough to watch with me even one hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Then he went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "O, my Father, if this cup cannot pass except I drink it, Thy will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>So he left them and went away again, and prayed the third time in the same words as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Look! the hour is at hand; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>"Rouse yourselves! Let us go. My betrayer is close at hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>Barely had he spoken these words when Judas, one of the Twelve,  appeared, accompanied by a great crowd of men with swords and staves,  from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying. "Whoever I kiss is the man; arrest him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>So he came straight up to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him eagerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>"Friend, do that for which you came," said Jesus. Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one of these who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smote the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him. "Put back your sword into its place! for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>"Do you not suppose that I am able to appeal to my Father to furnish me at this very moment with twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>"But if I did, how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say that thus it must happen?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>Then Jesus said to the crowds. "Are you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to arrest me? Day after day, I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>"But all this has happened in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Then all his disciples forsook him and fled; but those who had apprehended Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Now Peter was following him, afar off, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and when he got in, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to get false evidence against Jesus, in order that they might have him executed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>However, at last two came forward who said, "This fellow declared,  I can destroy the Temple of God and build it in three days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>Rising to his feet the high priest asked Jesus. "Do you make no answer? What is it that these are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus kept silence. Again the high priest addressed him, "I adjure you by the Living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>"I am He," Jesus answered; "yet I tell you that from this time on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his garments, saying. "He has spoken blasphemy! What further need have we of witnesses? For behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>"What is your verdict?" "He ought to die," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some struck him with the palms of their hands, and cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it who struck you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one of the maidservants came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Galilean!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all; "I do not know what you mean," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>Soon afterward he went out into the porch, and another maid saw him,  and said to those who were there, "This fellow certainly was with Jesus, the Nazarene!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I never knew the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "You also are certainly one of them, for your speech betrays you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I never knew the man."  Immediately the cock crew!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Then Peter recalled the word that Jesus had spoken, "Before the cock crow, you shall three times deny me" - and he went out and broke out into bitter weeping.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>And when the morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>After they had bound him, they led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the Roman Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>"I have sinned," he said, "in betraying innocent blood!" "What is that to us?" they answered; "you must see to that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And flinging down the silver into the Sanctuary, he rushed out, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the money, and said, "It would be wrong to put it into the temple-treasury, because it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>So after the consultation they bought the Potters Field with it,  for a burial-place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>That is the reason why, to this day, the field is called "The Field of Blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who had been priced, whom certain of the Children of Israel had priced;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the Potters Field, as the Lord had appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned him. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>"it is as you say," answered Jesus; but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he made no answer, not even to one charge; insomuch that the Governor was greatly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now it was the Governors custom, during the Passover, to release to the people any one prisoner whom they selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>He knew well that it was because of enmity that they had brought Jesus before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And while he was seated upon the judgment-seat, his wife had sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered many things today, in a dream, because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>So when Pilate said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release unto you?" they said, "Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>And Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" What one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>But Pilate said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they kept shouting the more fiercely, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that on the contrary a riot was threatening, he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying. "I am innocent of the blood of this man; you must answer for it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>All the people answered, "His blood be upon us and upon our children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he scourged, and delivered to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the Praetorium,  and gathered all the battalion together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And they twisted a thorny crown for him, and put it on his head, and placed a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him, in mockery, crying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head, again and again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>At last, when they had finished their mocking, they took the robe off, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to go with them to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (the word means "Place of a Skull"),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave Jesus wine to drink, mingled with gall. But after tasting it he refused to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>After crucifying him, they parted his garments among them by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then they sat and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>They also placed above his head his accusation written, This is Jesus The King of the Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>At that time two robbers, also, were crucified with him; one on his right hand, the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>Those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>"You who were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In like manner the chief priests, too, with the Scribes and elders,  kept taunting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>"He saved other," they said, "himself he cannot save. He, the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He put his trust in God. let Him deliver him now, if He cares for him. For he said, I am the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>In the same way the robbers also who were being crucified with him,  dept reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from noon darkness fell upon the whole land, until three oclock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>But at three oclock Jesus cried out in loud voice, "Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?" (That is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?")</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>When they heard this, some of the bystanders said "He is calling for Elijah!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>At once, one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said. "Let be! Let us see whether Elijah is coming to save him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And lo, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two, from the top to the bottom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>the earth quaked; the rocks split; the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>And coming forth out of the tombs, after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>When the Roman captain and the soldiers who were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that happened, they were greatly terrified and said, "Certainly this man must have been Gods Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were present several women who were looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from a Galilee, ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among them being Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jamesand Joses,  and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When it was eventide, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Josephus, who was himself a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Pilate then commanded that it be given over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and after rolling a great stone against the opening of the tomb, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>The day after - that is, the day following the Preparation - the chief priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>"We recollect, Sir, that when he was living this imposter said, I will rise again after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Now therefore give order to have the sepulcher securely guarded until the third day, for fear his disciples may come and steal him away, and then tell the people, He is risen from the dead;and so the last error will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>"You can have a guard," said Pilate. "Go your way, make it as secure as you can."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and made the sepulcher secure, by sealing the stone in the presence of the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>At the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came down to see the sepulcher, when lo!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>There had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, and gone and rolled away the stone, and was sitting upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>The guards trembled for fear of him, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But to the women the angel said. "You need have no fear, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the Crucified One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Master was lying!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly and tell his disciples. He is risen from the dead;  he goes before you into Galilee; you will see him there. Remember, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>On this they ran quickly from the sepulcher, in fear and great joy,  to tell the news to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold! Jesus himself met them, saying, "All hail!" And they went up to him and clasped his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them. "Fear not! Go tell my brothers to depart into Galilee, and they will see men there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and told the high priest all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they had met with the elders and conferred together, they heavily bribed the soldiers and told them to say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>"His disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>"If this should reach the Governors ears," they said, "we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were told; and this story has been noised abroad among the Jews, and continues to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came forward to them and spoke to them, saying. "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe every command which I have given you. and lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."</verse>
