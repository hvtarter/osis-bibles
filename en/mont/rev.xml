        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>\ul1 THE UNVEILING APOCALYPSE OF JESUS CHRIST\ul0  which God gave him to show to his slaves the things which must soon come to pass; and he sent and made it known by his angel to his slave John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>He bore witness of the Word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all the things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads, and they who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep what is written in it. \ul1 FOR THE CRISIS IS AT HAND\ul0 .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>From John to the seven churches that are in Asia the Roman Province. Grace to you, and peace from Him that is and was and is to be, and from the Seven Spirits that are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins in his own blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has made us to be a kingdom of priests unto his God and Father;  to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he is about to come among the clouds; and every eye will see him, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. So shall it be, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, who am your brother and who share with you in the woes and kingdom and stedfastness of Jesus, found myself in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and I heard a loud voice behind me, like a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and Sardis and Philadelphia and Laodicea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the Voice which was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the candlesticks One like to a son of man,  clothed with a robe down to the feet, and with a golden girdle round his breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hair were as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet like burnished brass, as if molten in a furnace; and his voice like the voice of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In his right hand he held seven stars; and out of mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was as the sun shining in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying. "Fear not; I am the first and the last,  and the Living One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore; and hold the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>So write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things that will come to pass hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks, is this. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the Church in Ephesus, write. These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and who walks among the seven golden candlesticks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works and your toil and stedfastness, and that you cannot endure evil men, and that you tested those who called themselves apostles, though they are not, and how you found them false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>You are holding fast, and have borne up for my namess sake, and have not grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember whence you have fallen, and turn again, and do your first works. Otherwise I am coming to you and will remove your candlestick out of its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes, to him will I give to eat from the tree of life which is in the garden of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And unto the angel of the Church in Smyrna, write. These are the words of the First and the Last, he who died and has returned to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your persecution and your poverty - but you are rich! I know the reviling of those who say that they themselves are Jews, when they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear not what you are about to suffer! Behold, the devil is indeed going to put some of you in prison, that you may be tested, and you will have persecution for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>Let him who has ears, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the Church in Pergamum, write These are the words of Him who holds the sharp two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is; and yet you are holding fast my name, and you have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my witness, my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan has his dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-  block before the sons of Israel, to eat food offered to idols, and to practise immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So you have also some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent; if you do not I will very soon come to you, and will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has ears, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written,  which no man knows, but he that receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the Church in Thyatira, write. These are the words of the Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works and your love and faith and service and endurance;  I know that your last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this against you, that you are tolerating that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she is teaching and leading my slaves astray, leading them to practise immorality, and to eat food which has been sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I have given her time for repentance; but she is determined not to turn from her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will lay her on a sick bed, and bring great distress upon those who have committed adultery with her, unless they turn away from her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And moreover, her children will I kill with pestilence. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the hearts and souls of men. I will give to each of you according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to the rest of you in Thyatira, those who do not hold his teaching, and who do not know the "deep things" of Satan (as they call them),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>I say that I am imposing upon you no fresh burden; only hold fast what you have till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>To him that overcomes and perseveres in my works to the end, will I give authority over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he shall shepherd them with a rod of iron, shattering them like earthen vessels (as I myself have received from my Father),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give him the Morning Star."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>To the angel of the Church at Sardis, write. These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works, that you have the name of being alive, but are really dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be continually on the watch, and establish the things that remain,  which were ready to die. For I have not found your works perfected before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Call to mind, then, what you have received and heard, and hold to it, and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come as a thief,  and you will never know at what hour I am coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Yet you have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garment; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes shall thus be clad in white raiment; and I will in no wise blot out his name from the book of life, and I will own his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>Write also to the angel of the Church in Philadelphia. These things says He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens, and no one shall shut; and who shuts, and no one opens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works. Lo, I have set before you an open door, which none can shut; for though you have only a little strength, you have kept my word, and have not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I am making those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, but are not, but are lying; behold, I will make them to come and bow in reverence before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from that hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to test those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He that overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God;  and he shall go out from it nevermore. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>To the angel of the Church in Laodicea, write. These things says the Amen, the witness, faithful and true, the beginning of the creation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither hot nor cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Would that you were either cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm,  and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>For you keep saying, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and do not know that you are the wretched one, and pitiable and beggared and blind and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I advise you to buy of me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white raiment to clothe yourself, so that the shame of your nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint your eyes, in order that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>All whom I love I reprove and discipline; therefore be full of zeal and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I am standing at the door and knocking! If any one listens to my voice, and opens the door, I will come to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him who overcomes, I will grant to sit down with me on my throne,  as I myself have overcome and have taken my seat with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>Let any one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this, in my vision, I saw a door opened in heaven! And the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying,  "Come up hither, and I will show you the things that must come to pass hereafter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, there stood a throne in heaven, and upon the throne One sat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>and he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius;  and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne were four and twenty Elders seated, who were clothed in white raiment, with golden crowns upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>From the throne issued lightning and voices and thunders. Seven blazing lamps were burning before the throne; these are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And in front of the throne as it seemed, a glassy sea like crystal;  and in the midst of the throne and encircling it are four Living Creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first creature was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a mans, and the fourth creature was like an eagle flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four Living Creatures, each one with six wings, are full of eyes round about and within; day and night they are chanting ceaselessly. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty. Who was, and who is, and who is to come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And whenever the Living Creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the four and twenty Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>"Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, To receive the glory and the honor and the power; For thou didst create all things, And because of thy will they came into being And were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>Then I saw lying upon the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne,  a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in the heavens or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>so I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>But one of the Elders said to me. "Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, and so can open the book with its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>Then I beheld a Lamb standing as if slain in the midst of the throne and of the four Living Creatures, and in the midst of the Elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes (which are the seven Spirits of God,  sent forth into all the earth).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he went, and now he has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>When he took the book, the four Living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb. And each had a harp and a golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book And to open its seals; For thou wast slain and didst ransom for God Men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>Thou hast made them kings and priests unto our God, And they shall reign on earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked and heard a voice of many angels encircling the throne and a voice of the Living Creatures and of the Elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>singing aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain, To receive power and riches and wisdom And might and honor and glory and blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And I heard every created thing that is in heaven, or on earth, or beneath the earth, or on the sea, and all things that are in them,  saying, "To him who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb, Be the blessing and the honor, And the glory and the power, Forever and ever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four Living Creatures kept saying, "Amen!" And the Elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four Living Creatures say, with a voice like thunder,  "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and lo, a white horse, and he who sat on him had a bow;  and there was given him a crown; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second Living Creature say, "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse come forth, a red horse. To him who sat on it, it was allowed to take peace from the earth, and to cause men to kill one another; and a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third Living Creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and lo, a black horse! He who sat on him had a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard the semblance of a voice in the midst of the four Living Creatures, saying. "A quart of wheat for a shilling, and three quarts of barley for a shilling; but do not harm the oil and the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Living Creature calling, "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>So I liked, and lo, a pale horse; and he who sat on him was named Death; and Hades was following after him. To them was given authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they bore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And with a loud voice they cried, saying, "O Master, holy and true,  How long dost thou not judge And avenge our blood On those who dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to each one of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for yet a little time, until the number should be completed by their fellow slaves and their brethren who were about to be put to death as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black, like sackcloth, and the full moon became like blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of the sky fell to earth, as a fig tree shaken by a gale drops its unripe figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the sky parted asunder like a rolled-up scroll; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>and the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, the rich and the mighty, both slaves and freemen, every one of them hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they began to say to the mountains and to the rocks. "Fall upon us and hide us From the face of him who is seated upon the throne,  And from the wrath of the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the Great Day of their wrath has come, And who is able to stand?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds from blowing on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having a seal of the living God; and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, "Do no harm to the earth, or the sea, or the trees, Until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed; Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>Of the tribe of Symeon, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>Of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and a great quantity of incense was given him to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>And the third angel blew his trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star, blazing like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs. (The name of the star is called Wormwood.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the bottomless pit, and out of the pit there went up a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air grew dark, because of the smoke out of the pit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>Yet they were not permitted to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion,  when it stings a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle.  On their heads there was something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like mens faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions teeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>and they had breastplates something like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots, of many horses rushing into battle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>and thus I saw the horses in the vision and their riders. They had breastplates of fire, "red as fire, dark blue as jacinth, and yellow as sulphur." The heads of the horses were like lions heads, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.  For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with them they work woe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>And the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands. They would not give up the worship of demons and of idols made of gold and silver, and brass,  and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,  nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts.</verse>
