  <div type='book' osisID='John'>
      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was face to face with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was face to face with God in the Beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into being through him, and apart from him nothing that exists came into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light is shining in the darkness, and the darkness has not overwhelmed it</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>A man came into being, sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came as a witness, that he might bear testimony concerning the Light - so that all men might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light; it was to bear testimony concerning the Light that he came into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true Light, which enlightens every man, was then coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and through him the world came into being, yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own creation, and his own folk welcomed him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But to all who receive him, to them he has given the right to become children of God, even to those who trust in his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and tented with us. And we gazed on his glory - glory as of the Fathers only Son - full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness concerning him, and cried aloud, saying, "This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me has been put before me,  for he was before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For out of his fulness we have all received, yes, grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man has ever seen God; God, only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father - he has interpreted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent some priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He acknowledged - he did not deny it - but acknowledged, "I am not the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>"What then?" they questioned; "Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."  "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then said they to him. "Who are you? That we may give some answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, "I am a voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>so they questioned him, saying, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>"I indeed am baptizing in water," John said in reply, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>One who is to come after me, whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to untie."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened in Bethany, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said. "Behold, that is Gods Lamb, who takes and bears away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me comes One who has been put before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I myself did not recognize him; I only came baptizing in water, in order that he might be openly shown to Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also bore this testimony, saying. "I saw the Spirit like a dove descend from heaven and rest upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I did not recognize him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting upon him, is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>This I have seen, and I am become a witness to the fact that he is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Next day again, John was standing with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>After gazing intently on Jesus as he walked about, he said, "Look!  that is the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned and saw them following him, and said, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi" (which may be translated Teacher), "where are you staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, "Come, and you shall see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four oclock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two men who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>In the morning he found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (a word which means Christ, the Anointed One).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at him and said. "You are Simon, son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (or Peter,  which means Rock).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>Next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee; and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Then Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found him about whom Moses wrote in the Law, as did the prophets - Jesus of Nazareth,  Josephs son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said, "Behold a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>"How do you know me?" asked Nathanael. "Before Philip called you,"  replied Jesus, "when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>"Rabbi," answered Nathanael, "you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus said in reply. "Do you believe because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>You shall see greater things than that! Believe me," he added, "you all shall see heaven opened wide, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Now two days after this there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus also was invited to the wedding, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine ran short, Jesus mother said to him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>"Woman," said Jesus, "what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he may tell you to do,  do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six stone water - jars standing there, according to the Jewish rites of purification, each holding about twenty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said, "Fill up the jars with water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>So they filled them brimful. Then he said, "Draw some out now, and carry it to the master of the feast."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>So they carried it. And when the master of the feast had tasted of the water which had been made wine, not knowing where it came from,  though the attendants who had drawn it knew, he called the bridegroom and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>"Everybody serves first the good wine, and when people have drunk freely, the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and showed forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>Afterward he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and remained there a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>There he found in the temple those who were selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>So he plaited a scourge of rushes, and drove all out of the temple -  both the sheep and oxen. He began to pour out the coins of the money-  changers, and to overturn their tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and said to those who were selling doves. "Take these things away!  Make not my Fathers house a house of trade!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples recalled that it is written, The zeal of thine house will devour me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews asked Jesus, "What sign are you going to show us,  seeing that you do these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>"Destroy this temple," answered Jesus, "and in three days I will raise it up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews retorted, "This Temple took forty-six years to build, and will you raise it in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he was speaking about the temple of his body; and when the disciples recalled what he had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>after he had been raised from the dead, they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, when they beheld the signs which he did;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>but for his part Jesus was not trusting himself to them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and did not need any ones testimony concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him. "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent from God; for no man can do these signs which you are continually doing, unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>"In very truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless a man is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus replied; "Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb, and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>"I tell you solemnly," Jesus answered, "that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>What is born of the flesh is flesh; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not at my telling you, You must all be born again from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its voice, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with every one who has been born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>"How can this be?" said Nicodemus in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>"Are you the Teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?" said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>"Most solemnly I tell you we are speaking of what we know, and it is about that of which we were eyewitnesses that we give testimony. Yet all of you reject our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and yet none of you believe me,  how will you believe if I tell you concerning heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>There is no one gone up to heaven, except the One who came down from heaven - the Son of man himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>in order that every one who believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever trusts in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,  but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who trusts in him is not condemned, but he who does not trust has already been condemned, because he has not put his trust in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one who practises wrong hates light, and does not come to the light, lest his actions be exposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>but he who does what is true, comes to the light, in order that his actions may be shown to have been wrought in God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the countryside of Judea, and there he was staying with them and baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John also was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there were many streams there, and people kept coming to receive baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then some of Johns disciples got into a controversy with a Jew in regard to purification; so they came to John and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>"Rabbi, see! The man who was with you on the other side of Jordan,  and to whom you yourself have borne testimony, is now baptizing, and everybody is coming to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>In reply John said. "A man cannot obtain anything unless it has been granted to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ,  but have been sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. So then this joy of mine has now complete fulfilment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>"He that comes from above is above all; but one who is of the earth,  of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He bears testimony to what he has heard and seen, yet no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>Whoever does receive it has set his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God sent utters the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit sparingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>the Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Accordingly when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard it said,  "Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though Jesus himself was not accustomed to baptize, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Now he had to pass through Samaria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>so he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacobs Spring was there. So Jesus, tired out with his journey, was sitting thus by the spring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>It was about noon, and a woman of Samaria came to draw water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink" (for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>"How is it," answered the Samaritan woman, "that you who are a Jew ask a drink from me, a woman, and a Samaritan?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>"If you had known the free gift of God," Jesus answered, "and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked of him,  and he would have given you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>"Sir," said the woman, "you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Surely you are not greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle, too?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>"All who drink of this water," Jesus answered, "will thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst any more, but the water that I will give him shall become a living spring of water within him, welling up into eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>"Sir!" exclaimed the woman, "give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty, nor come all this way to draw water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and then come here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>"I have no husband," answered the woman. "You are right in saying I have no husband,"Jesus said to her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>"for you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband; in this you have spoken truly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>"I see, Sir, that you are a prophet," replied the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>"Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain, yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>"Woman, believe me," said Jesus, "that the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You are worshiping something you do not know. we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father is seeking such as his worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>"I know," said the woman, "that Messiah is coming, who is called the Christ; when he has come he will tell us everything."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, "I who am now talking to you, am he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Just then his disciples came up, and were astonished that he was talking with a woman; yet not one of them asked him, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>Then the woman left her water-jar, and went away into the city and began saying to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>"Come! see a man who has told me everything that I ever did. He cant be the Christ, can he?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They left the city and set out to go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile the disciples kept urging him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>"Rabbi," they said, "eat something." But he answered, "I have food to eat of which you know nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples began to say to one another, "Can any one have brought him something to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them. "My food is to do the will of Him who sent me,  and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, It wants yet four months, and then comes the harvest?Look, I tell you! Lift up your eyes and behold the fields,  that they are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The reaper is already receiving wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this respect the saying is true, One sows, another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap a crop on which you have not toiled. Others have toiled, and you have reaped the benefit of their toil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman when she declared, "He told me everything that I ever did."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans arrived, they began asking him to remain with them; and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>Then many more believed because of what he said, himself; and they told the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>"We no longer believe because of what you said. for we ourselves have heard him, and we know that this is certainly the Saviour of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After these two days Jesus went away from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>When he reached Galilee, however, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they,  too, had been at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So he came back again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. Now there was one of the kings officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and heal his son who was lying at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>"Sir," said the kings officer, "come down before my little boy dies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus answered. "Go your way. Your son lives." And the man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him, and started to go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And when he was already on his way down, his slaves met him, saying that his boy was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he asked them at what hour he had begun mend. They answered,  "Yesterday, about one oclock, the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Then the father realized that it had left him at the very hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives," and he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is the second sign which Jesus performed, on returning from Judea to Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep-gate, called in the Hebrew, Bethesda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>It has five colonnades. In these there used to lie a great crowd of sick people - blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And there was one man there for thirty-eight years in his infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>"Sir," answered the sick man, "I have no man to put me into the pool whenever the water is troubled; and while I am trying to come, some one else steps down before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>"Rise," said Jesus, "take up your bed and go walking away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>Instantly the man became well, and he took up his bed and started to walk. Now it was Sabbath on that day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>so the Jews kept saying to the man who had been cured. "It is the Sabbath Day; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He replied, "The man who healed me told me to take up my bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>"Who is it," they asked, "that said to you, take up your bed and go walking away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had moved away, as there was a crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus found him in the Temple, and said to him. "Look! You have become well. Do not go on sinning, lest a worse thing befall you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went to and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>and because of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he had done it on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But he answered them, "My Father has continued working until now,  and I am working too."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this reason the Jews continued to seek the more eagerly to put him to death, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was actually speaking of God as his own Father, thus making himself of Gods equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>So Jesus answered them in these words. "In solemn truth I tell that the Son cannot do anything of himself, except what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>"For the Father loves the Son, and shows him every thing that he himself is doing. And greater deeds than these will he show him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>"For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, even so the Son makes whom he will alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>"The Father indeed does not judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>"in order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.  He who does not honor Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>"I tell you solemnly that he who listens to my messages and believes Him who sent me, has eternal life. He will not come under condemnation, but has passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>"Solemnly I tell you that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>"For as the Father has life in himself, so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>"And he has given him authority to pronounce judgment, because he is Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>"Do not wonder at this, because an hour is coming in which all who are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>"those who have done good into a resurrection of life, and those who have practised evil to a resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>"I can of my own self do nothing. As I listen, I judge, and my own judgment is just, because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>"If I bear testimony concerning myself, my testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>"Another bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>"You yourselves sent to John, and he has been and is a witness to the truth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After this Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee (that is the lake of Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>A great crowd were following him, because they witnessed the signs which he was continually performing among those who were ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Then Jesus walked up the hills and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Jewish feast, the Passover, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Accordingly when he looked up, and perceived a great crowd was coming unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he intended to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>"Thirty-five dollars worth of bread," answered Philip, "is not enough for them, so that each can take a morsel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon, said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>"There is a lad who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish; but what is that among so many?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>"Make the men sit down," said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so the men sat down, in numbers about five thousand. "of righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you will no longer see me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks he distributed them among those who were seated; in like manner also of the fish, as much as they wished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>and when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the fragments that are left, so that nothing may be wasted."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves - the broken pieces that were left after they had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>So when the people saw the sign which he had performed, they said,  "This is in the truth the Prophet who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>When Jesus perceived that they intended to seize him in order to make him a king, he retired again to the hill all by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>When evening came on, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>There they got in a boat, and started across the sea for Capernaum.  The darkness had already fallen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>Jesus had not yet come to them, and the sea began to rise, because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>After they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing near to the boat, and they were terrified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>but he said to them, "It is I, be not afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were willing to take him on board, and immediately the boat reached the shore they were making for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The crowd that remained on the other side of the sea had seen that there was only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not gone aboard with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>So, on the following day, when boats came from Tiberias near the place were they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks,  they got into the boats themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when they saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him,  "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that you are looking for me, not because you saw miracles signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>"Labor not for food which perishes, but for the food that endures eternal life - that which the Son of man will give you; for on the Father - God - has set his seal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>"What are we to do habitually," they asked him, "that we may keep working the words of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>"This is the work of God," answered Jesus, "that you believe on him whom He has sent you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>The they said to him. "What sign, then, are you performing, so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>"Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>"In solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus in reply, "Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread out of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>"for the bread of God is what come down from heaven, and gives life to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>"Ah, Sir," said they, "evermore give us this bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>"I myself am the bread of life," answered Jesus; "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>"But as I told you, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>"Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will never reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>"For I am come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>"And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>"For this is my Fathers will, that every one who beholds the Son and believes on him, shall have eternal life. and I will raise him up at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Then the Jews began to find fault with Jesus, because he said, "I am the bread which comes down out of heaven," and they kept asking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>"Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph? Do we not know his father and mother? How is it that he now says, I have come down from heaven?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>"Do not find fault with me among yourselves,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>answered Jesus; "no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him; then I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>"It is written in the Prophets, "And they shall all of them be taught of God. Every one who has listened to the father and learns from him, comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>"Not that any one has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Then the Jews began to dispute among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>"I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He spoke these words while in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>So many of his disciples, when they heard it, said. "This teaching is unbelievable! Who can listen to him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>Jesus, conscious within himself that his disciples were finding fault with him about his teaching, said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>"Does this displease you? What then if you were to behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>"The spirit is what gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words which I have been speaking to you, are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>"Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who should betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>So he added, "This is why I told you that no on can come to me unless it be given from the Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>Therefore many of his disciples drew back and no longer companied with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>So Jesus appealed to the Twelve. "You also do not wish to leave me,  do you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered. "To whom shall we go Master? You have words of eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>"and we have learned to believe and we know that you are the holy one of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>In reply Jesus said to them. "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And yet even of you one is an enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Now Jesus was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for Judas was to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus continued to travel about in Galilee, for he did not wish to go about in Judea, because the Jews kept trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>When the time of the Jewish feast of Tabernacles drew near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>his brothers said to him. "Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also may behold the works which you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>"For no one ever does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known publicly. If you are performing these signs, show yourself openly to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>"My time is not yet come," said Jesus, "but your time is always at hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>After saying this, he remained in Galilee; but after his brothers had gone up to feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>then he went too - not openly, but as it were a secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews meanwhile kept looking for him at feast, and saying, "Where is he?" "I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>and there was much disputing about him among the crowd. Some would say, "He is a good man." Others. "No! he is misleading the people."  "While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me. I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>No one, however, was speaking openly about him, for fear of the Jews. "But now I am coming to thee, and I am speaking these things while I am in the world, so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>But when it was already the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. "I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews were amazed. They said, "How does this fellow know the sacred writings when he has never learned them?" "I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world, but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>In reply Jesus said to them; "My teaching is not mine, but is his who sent me. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>"The man who speaks on his own authority is always seeking his own glory. But one who is eager for the glory of Him who sent him, he is true, and therefore is nothing false about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>"Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you is keeping the Law.  Why are you seeking to kill me?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of the men of Jerusalem were saying. "Is not this the man they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>"And look! he is speaking boldly and they are saying nothing to him.  Can it possibly be that the rulers have really discovered that he is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>"But we know this man and where he is from; but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>So Jesus cried aloud as he was teaching in the Temple, and said.  "You both know me and you know where I am from; and I am not come on my own authority, but he who sent me is trustworthy, and him you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>"But I now him, because I am from him and he sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they kept seeking to arrest him, but no man laid hands on him,  because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But many of the crowd believed on him and began to say, "The Christ,  when he comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the high priest and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said to them. "Still for a little longer I am with you,  and then I am going my way to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>"You will search for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Then the Jews said to one another. "Where does this fellow intend to go, so that we shall not find him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>"What does he mean saying, You shall seek me and you shall not find me, and Where I am you cannot come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now the last day, that the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried in a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>"If any man thirst let him come to me and drink. From the heart of him who believes in me will flow, as the Scripture said, rivers of living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now he said this concerning the Spirit whom those who believed in him should receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Some of the crowd who had been listening to these discourses began to say, "Without a doubt this man is a Prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Other said, "He is the Christ." But others were saying. "Surely the Christ is not to come out of Galilee, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>"Does not the Scripture say that the Christ is coming of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, Davids town?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So a division arose in the crowd concerning him. Some of them wished to apprehend him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Then the officers returned to the chief priest and Pharisees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>and they asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, "Never yet did a man speak like this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>"Surely you have not been led astray, have you? answered the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>"Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>"As for this mob who do not understand the Law, they are accursed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, one of their number, he who had formerly visited Jesus,  said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>"Our law does not condemn the accused, does it, before hearing his defense, and finding out what he is doing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>In answer they said to him. "You are not from Galilee, are you?  Search for yourself, and see that from Galilee arises no prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then they departed each to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>At dawn, however, he came back to the Temple, where the people came to him in crowds. He had taken his seat and was teaching them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>when the Scribes and Pharisees had brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the court, and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>"Rabbi, this woman has been found in the very act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>"Now Moses, in the Law, has commanded us to stone such creatures.  But you, what do you say?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>(This they said to tempt him, so that they could bring a charge against him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>But Jesus stooped down, and began to write on the ground with his finger. When they continued to question him, he raised himself and said to them, "Let the innocent man among you be the first to throw the stone at her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>Then he stooped down again, and again began to write on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus was left behind alone - and the woman in the middle of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Then Jesus raised himself up and said to her. "Woman, where are they? Has no man condemn you,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>"No one, Sir," she answered. "Neither do I condemned you," said Jesus. "Go, and never sin again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Once more Jesus addressed them. "I am the light of the world," he said; "He who follows me shall not walk in the darkness, but he shall have the Light of life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>Then said the Pharisees to him. "You are bearing testimony to yourself; your testimony is not true."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>In reply Jesus said to them. "Even if I do bear testimony to concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from, or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>"For you are judging according to the flesh. I am judging no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>"Though even if I do judge, my judgment is trustworthy, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>"And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>"I am one who gives testimony concerning myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony concerning me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>"Where is your Father?" they asked him. "You have neither known me nor my Father," answered Jesus. "If you had known me, you would have known my father also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>He said these words in the Treasury, while he was teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then again he said them. "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I am going, you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then the Jews said. "He will not kill himself, will he? Is that why he says, Where I am going you cannot come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>And he said to them. "You are from below. I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>"That is why I said that you would die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>"Who are you?" then they asked him. "What I am telling you from the beginning," Jesus answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>"I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world only those things which I have heard from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that he meant the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>so Jesus added. "When you lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He; and that I do nothing on my own authority, but that I speak just as the Father has taught me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>"and he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I do always the things that please him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>When he spoke in this way, many of the Jews believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>So Jesus spoke to the Jews that believed him, saying. "If you abide in my teaching, you are my true disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>"and you shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>"We are descendants of Abraham," they replied, "and have never been in slavery to any man. What do you mean by saying, You shall become free?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>"In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus replied, "every one who commits sin is a slave</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>"Now the slave does not remain permanently in the household, but the son does remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>"So then, if the Son shall set you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>"I know you are Abrahams descendants; but you are seeking to kill me, Because my teaching has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>"I am declaring what I have seen with the Father, and you are acting as you have learned from your father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>"Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you are indeed Abrahams children," said Jesus "do the deeds of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>"But now you are seeking to kill me - a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>"You are doing the deeds of your father." "We were not born of adultery," they said; "we have one Father, God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them. "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and am now come from God. I did not come on my own authority, but God himself sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>"How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot listen to my message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>"You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a man-slayer from the very beginning; and he has no standing place in the truth, because truth is not in him.  Whenever he utters a lie, he speaks from his nature, for he is a liar and the father of lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>"But as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>"Which one of you convicts me of sin? Why then, if I am speaking the truth, do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>"He who is from God listens to Gods words. For this reason you do not listen, because you are not from God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>In reply the Jews said to him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan, and you also have a demon?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>"I do not have a demon," said Jesus, "but I am honoring my Father,  and you are dishonoring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>"Yet I am not seeking my own honor. There is One who is seeking it,  and He is judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>"In solemn truth I tell you that if any one obeys my teaching he shall never behold death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>"Now we know that you have a demon," exclaimed the Jews. Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say, If any man obeys my teaching he shall never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>"You are not greater than our father Abraham, are you? And he died,  and the prophets died. Who are you making yourself out to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>"If I glorify myself." said Jesus, "my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, and you say, He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>"You are not acquainted with him; I know him. Were I to say, I do not know him, I should be like you, a liar. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>"Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it and was glad."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>"You are not yet fifty years old," said the Jews to him, "and you have seen Abraham?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>"In solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that before Abraham came into existence, I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the Temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>Now as he was passing along he saw a man, blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>"Rabbi," his disciples asked him, "who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>"Neither he nor his parents sinned." replied Jesus; "it happened that the works of God might be made manifest in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>"I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>"While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and smeared the clay on the mans eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>Then he said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (a word which means "sent"). So the man went and washed his eyes, and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Upon this the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he looks like him." "I am the man," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>So they asked him, "How then were your eyes opened?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered. "The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash;so I went and washed and received my sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>"Where is he?" they asked. "I do not know," answered the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>so the Pharisees again began to ask him questions about how he had regained his sight; and he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now I see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Then some of the Pharisees began to say, "This man in not from God,  because he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>So there was a difference of opinion among them. Accordingly they said to the blind man, "What have you to say about him, now that he has opened your eyes?" "He is a prophet," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews, however, did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man whose sight had been restored,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and questioned them. "Is this your son," they said, "who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>Then in reply his parents said. "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>"but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who has opened his eyes. Ask him, himself. He is of age. He will speak for himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>This his parents said because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess that he was the Christ, he should be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>It was because this that his parents said. "He is of age. Ask him,  himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So the Jews a second time summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>"Give glory to God! we know that this man is a sinner." Upon this the blind man answered. "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that once I was blind, and know I can see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>"What was it he did to you?" they asked him; "How did he open your eyes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered. "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear it again? Can it be that you, too, wish to become his disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>Then they stormed at him. "You are his disciple. We are Moses  disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>"We know that God spoke to Moses. But this fellow! We do not know where he comes from."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>"This is truly astonishing," said the man in reply, "that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is God-  fearing and does his will, to such he listens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>"Since the beginning of the world such a thing as opening the eyes of one who was born blind was never heard of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>"If this man had not come of God he could have done nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered, "You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us?"  Then they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him,  he said, "Do you believe in the Son of man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>"Who is he, Sir," he replied, "that I may believe on him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>"You have already seen him," Jesus answered, "and it is he who now speaks to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>"I do believe, Sir," said the man, and he prostrated himself at his feet. And Jesus said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>"For judgment am I come into the world, to make the sightless see,  and to make the seeing blind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked, "We are not blind, are we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>"If you were blind," Jesus answered them, "you would have no sin.  But now you are declaring, We see;so your sin remains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>"Is it written in your law," replied Jesus, "I said, You are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>"If those to whom the word of God came are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do you mean to tell me, whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Many who came to him said, "John did not perform any signs, but everything he said about this man was true."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a man named Lazarus was ill. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>- it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent to him, saying. "Master, see who you hold dear is ill."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard it he said, "This illness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that through it the Son of God may be glorified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>However, when he heard that he was ill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>he still remained where he was for two days; then after that he said to his disciples, "Let us go back again to Judea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>"Rabbi," answered his disciples, "it was but just now that the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus replied. "Are there not twelve hours in the daytime? If any one walks in the daytime he does not stumble, because he beholds the light of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if any one walks during the night he does stumble, because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>This he said, then told them, "Lazarus, our friend, has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>"Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well," replied the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had been speaking concerning his death, but they thought that he was talking about natural sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>So then he told them plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>"Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. Come, let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Upon this Thomas, who was called "The Twin," said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too, that we may die with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>so when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>so a number of the Jews had gone to Martha and Mary to sympathize with them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>So when Martha learned that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him,  but Mary remained sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus. "Master, had you been here my brother would not have died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>but even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha answered, "I know that he will rise in the resurrection, at the Last Day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>"I am the resurrection and the life, "said Jesus. "He who believes in me, even if he has died, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And every one who is living and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>"Yes, Master," she answered, "I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>With these words she went away to call her sister Mary, saying privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>So when Mary heard this, she rose quickly and went to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus had not yet arrived in the village, but was still at the place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were in the house trying to console her, when they saw that Mary rose quickly and went out, followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>When Mary came to the place where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master had you been here, my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Then when Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews likewise who accompanied her, sobbing, he shuddered with indignation in his spirit, and was deeply agitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>"Where have you laid him?" he said. "Master, come and see," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus burst into tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>"See how he loved him," said the Jews. But some of them said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>"Could not this man, who has opened the eyes of the blind man, have prevented this man also from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore, again shuddering in himself with indignation, came to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone lying upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>"Roll away the stone," said Jesus. "Master," said Martha, the sister of the dead man "he is offensive by this time, for he has been four days in the tomb."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus answered her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe you should see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they rolled the stone away; and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>"Father, I thank thee that thou hast listened to me. And I knew that thou art ever listening to me, but for the sake of the crowd who are standing about, I said it, in order that they may believe that thou hast sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said this he cried with a great voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>Out came the dead man, wrapped hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face bound up in a napkin. Jesus said to them, "Untie him, and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many of the Jews, therefore, who had come with Mary, and had seen what he did, believed on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>"What are we going to do?" they said, "now that this man is performing many signs?" If we leave him alone, this way, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and rob us of both our sacred place and of our people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of their number, Caiaphas by name, who was high priest that year, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>"You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>now he did not say this of his own accord; but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die in behalf of the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not in behalf of the nation alone, but in order that he might gather into one the widely scattered children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day they plotted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the region near the desert to a town called Ephraim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>and there remained with his disciples. Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem for purification before the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>So they kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think - that he will not come to the feast at all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was. he should give information, so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>So then Jesus came six days before the Passover, to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served it; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined with him at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over his feet, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then said Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>"Why was not this perfume sold for fifty dollars, and the proceeds given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, carrying the purse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>used to purloin what was put in it. Then said Jesus. "Let her alone.  Against the day of my burial has she kept this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>for the poor you have with you always, but me you have not always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>When the great mass of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came not alone because of Jesus, but to see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them, and beginning to believe on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>Next day the big crowd who had come up for the Passover heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>and taking branches from the palm trees went out to meet him,  shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.  Even Israels King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus found a young ass and seated himself on it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh seated upon an asss colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written concerning him, and what they had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Meanwhile the crowd which was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, kept witnessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this reason, too, the crowd came to meet him, because they had heard about this sign which he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>Then the Pharisees said among themselves. "You see! You can do nothing! Look! The world is gone after him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship during the Passover feast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir,"  they said, "we want to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  Jesus answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>"The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>In solemn truth I tell you that except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains a single kernel; but if it die it bears a great crop.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any one is ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am there shall my servant be also. If any man is ready to serve me, him will my Father honor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name!" Whereupon there came a voice from heaven,  saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Then the crowd who stood around and heard it, said, "It thundered!"  But others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>"It is not for my sake," answered Jesus, "that the voice came, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is a judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be driven out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>Then the people answered. "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abides forever. What do you mean by The Son of man must be lifted up?Who is this Son of man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>"The Light is among you a little longer," answered Jesus. "Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become Sons of Light."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>With these words Jesus went away and hid himself from them. But although he had wrought such signs in their presence, still they did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>So the words spoken by Isaiah, the prophet, were fulfilled. Lord,  who hath believed our message, And to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>This was why they could not believe, because Isaiah said again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes and make their hearts hard, Lest they should see with their eyes, perceive with their minds, And should turn, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah uttered these words because he saw his glory, and he spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed on him, but did not confess in on account of the Pharisees, for fear lest they be put out of the Synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Now Jesus, speaking in a loud voice, had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>"He who believes in me believes not in me, but in Him who sent me;  and he who sees me sees him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>Like light am I come into the world, so that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any one hears my words and does not keep them, it is not I who judge him; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has indeed a judge. The message which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the Last Day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>because I have never spoken on my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what words to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now just before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour was come when he should leave this world to go to the Father,  having loved his own who were in the world, showed forth his love to the end. ;38 "Your life you will lay down for me?

        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he had girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Then the disciples began looking at one another, wondering which one of them he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>There was reclining upon Jesus breast one of the disciples whom he loved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered him. "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants have fought hard that I should not be handed the Jews; but in reality my kingdom is not of such origins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>"You are a king, then? You!" said Pilate. "You say truly that I am a king." answered Jesus, "for this purpose I was born, and to this end came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every man who is of the truth listens to my voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" As he said this, he went outside again to the Jews and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>"I find no crime in this man. Now it is a custom of yours that I release one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover feast. Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>So when the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted.  "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him,"  said Pilate, "for I find no crime in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be Gods Son,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Now when Pilate heard these words he was more alarmed than ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and entering the Praetorium again, he said to Jesus, "What is your origin?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Jesus made no answer. So Pilate said to him. "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, or power to crucify you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>"You would have no power over me," answered Jesus, "unless it had been given you from above. For this reason he who has betrayed me to you has the greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>After that Pilate began to seek to release him, but the Jews shouted out. "If you release this man you are no friend of the Emperor. Any man who makes himself out to be king is a rebel against the Emperor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out and made him sit on the judges seat in a place called the Mosaic Pavement (the Hebrew name is Gabbatha).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six oclock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>Then they shouted. "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"  "Crucify your King?" said Pilate. The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>So then he gave him over to them to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>So they took Jesus, who went forth bearing his own cross, to a place called The Place of a Skull - in the Hebrew tongue, Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they crucified him; and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate moreover wrote an inscription and placed it above the cross. What he wrote was, "JESUS, THE NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This inscription was read by many of the Jews, because the place where they crucified Jesus was near the city, and the inscription was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write King of the Jews, but He said, I am King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, to each soldier a part, and the tunic.  Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>so the soldiers said one to another. "Let us not tear it. Let us draw lots, to see whose it shall be" - that the Scripture might be fulfilled. They divided my garments among them, For my raiment did they cast lots. This was what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus saw his mother, and standing near her the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman behold your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After that, when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished, he said in fulfilment of the words of Scripture, "I am thirsty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was a jar full of vinegar standing there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a stalk of hyssop, and put it to his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Then after he had taken the vinegar, Jesus said, "IT IS FINISHED!"  And bowing his head, he yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>It was Preparation Day, so in order to prevent the bodies hanging on the cross during the Sabbath (for the Sabbath was a great day) the Jews begged Pilate to have the legs broken, and the bodies taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But upon coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead, and did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who saw it has borne testimony, and his testimony is trustworthy, and he knows that he is telling the truth in order that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,  but in secret because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus also (the one who visited Jesus by night, at first) came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>There was a garden near the place where Jesus had been crucified,  and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>Here, because of its being Preparation Day, and as the tomb was near by, they placed Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she came running to Simon Peter and that other disciple whom Jesus loved, saying, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>So Peter and the other disciples set out at once to go to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They both began to run; and the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>Stooping down he glanced in and saw the linen wrapping lying on the ground; but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Peter also came following him, and he went inside the tomb; and he gazed at the linen wrapping as they lay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin which had been about his head not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up in its own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple also who arrived first at the tomb went inside, and he perceived and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For not yet had they understood the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went back again to their home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>Meanwhile, outside, Mary stood sobbing near the tomb. Still sobbing she stooped and looked into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and gazed at two angels in glistening white sitting, one at the head the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She answered,  "Because they have taken away my Master, and I do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her. "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir,  if you have borne him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away, myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>"Mary," said Jesus. She turned to him. "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew. That is to say, "Teacher."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>"Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I am not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Away went Mary Magdalene to the disciples with the tidings, "I have seen the Master!" and that he said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>On the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, although the doors of the room where the disciples gathered had been locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and there he stood among them,  saying. "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>As he said this he showed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciple glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then Jesus said to them again. "Peace to you. As my Father has sent me forth, I also now am sending you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this he breathed upon them and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you remit any ones sins, they are remitted; if you retain them they are retained."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called "The Twin." was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>Accordingly the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord." But he told them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood there among and said. "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then to Thomas he said. "Place your finger here, and see my hands;  and place your hand here, and thrust it into my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>"Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed," Jesus told him. "Blessed are those who, without seeing, yet believed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>There were then many other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After this Jesus showed himself again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. He showed himself as follows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called "The Twin," and Nathanael, from Cana of Galilee, and the two sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They answered him,  "And we are going with you." So they went out and got into the boat,  and throughout the night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when day was dawning Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples,  however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>So Jesus said to them, "Lads, you havent any fish, have you?" They answered him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, "Cast your net on the right side of the boat,  and you will find." So they cast it, and now they could not haul it in for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"  On hearing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter girt his fishers coat about him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>The rest of the disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore - only about a hundred yards - dragging in the net full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they got to the shore they beheld a charcoal fire ready laid,  with fish on it, and some bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>"Bring some of the fish you have just caught," Jesus told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter went and dragged the net to shore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; but for all this number the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>"Come and have breakfast," said Jesus to them. Not one of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" Knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus went and took bread and gave it to them, and the fish also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they were through breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,  son of John, do you love me more than these others do?" "Yes, Lord,  you know that you are dear to me." he answered. Jesus said to him,  "Feed my lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"  He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me." "Be a shepherd to my sheep," said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>The third time Jesus asked him, "Am I really dear to you?" Peter was grieved because the third time he asked, "Am I really dear to you?"  and he answered, "Master, you know all things, you know that you are dear to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>"Feed my sheep," said Jesus. "In solemn truth I tell you that when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands for some one to gird you, and carry you where you do not wish to go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he said to show by what kind of death Peter was to glorify God.  After speaking thus, he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following - he who at the supper leaned back upon his breast and said,  "Lord, who is to betray you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>On catching sight of him, Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>"If I choose that he remain until I come," said Jesus, "what is that to you? Do you follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Accordingly the report spread among the brothers that this disciple should not die; but Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said, "If I choose that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>It is this disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who recorded them; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>But there are also many other things which Jesus did; if every one of them were to be recorded in detail I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.</verse>
