  <div type='book' osisID='Col'>
      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the holy and believing brothers in Christ who are in Colosse.  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>Whenever I pray for you I am continually thanking God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>(since I heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love to all the saints)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Long ago you heard of this hope in the message which came to you of the truth of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>And just as it is spreading through the whole world, bearing fruit and increasing, so also is it among you, from the day in which you heard it, and came truly to know the grace of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as you learned it from Epaphras, our dearly loved fellow slave. He is a faithful minister of Jesus Christ in your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>and it is he who has told me of your love for me in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this reason from the day I heard of it I have never ceased to pray for you, asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will with every kind of wisdom and spiritual insight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that you may walk worthy of the Lord in every kind of pleasing; that you may be fruitful in every kind of good work, and may increase in the knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>that you may be strengthened in every kind of strength by the might of his glory for every kind of patience and fortitude with good cheer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>I ask that you may give thanks to the Father who has made us fit to receive our share of the heritage of the saints in the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>For he has delivered us out of the dominion of the darkness, and transplanted us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is a visible image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>for in him was the universe created, things in heaven and on earth,  the seen and the unseen, thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; by him and for him all have been created;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>and HE IS before all, and in him all things subsist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>He is the head of his Body, the Church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, in order that in all things he may become preeminent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For in him all the divine fulness chose to dwell;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by him it chose to reconcile all things alike on earth or in heaven to himself; making peace by him, through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you, alienated as you once were, hostile at heart in your evil deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>he has now in his human body reconciled to God by his death, in order that he may bring you into his presence, holy and unblemished and irreproachable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>And this he will do if, indeed, you continue in the faith, firmly founded and stedfast, and never moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, and which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, that gospel of which I, Paul, was made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I am now rejoicing in my sufferings on your behalf; and I am filling up in my own body what is yet lacking of the sufferings of Christ in behalf of the church, his Body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>It is of this I was made a minister, according to the stewardship entrusted to me by God for you, fully to declare Gods message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>that secret truth, which, although hidden from ages and generations of old, has now been made manifest to his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To them God willed to make known among the Gentiles how glorious are the riches of that secret truth, which is "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>Him I am ever proclaiming, warning every one and teaching every one,  in all wisdom; that I may bring every man into his presence, full grown in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>For that end I am ever toiling, wrestling with all that energy of his which is mightily at work within me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I would have you know how great a contest I am waging for you and the brethren in Laodicea, and for all who have never seen my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>May their hearts be comforted! May they be knit together in love!  May they gain in all its riches the full assurance of their understanding! May they come to a perfect knowledge of the secret truth of God, which is Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>And this I say, lest any one should mislead you with enticing words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent from you in body, I am with you in spirit,  happy to note your discipline and the solid front of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As then you have received Jesus Christ, your Lord, in him live your lives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>since you are rooted in him, and in him continually built up. Be firmly established in the faith as you were taught it, and continually abound in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Take care lest any man drag you away captive by his philosophy which is a vain deceit, following the traditions of men and the worlds crude notions, and not Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For it is in Christ that all the fullness of deity dwells bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and in him you have your fulness, and he is the Lord of all the principalities and powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands; even in putting off your sensual nature in Christs own circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>when you were buried with him in baptism. In baptism also you were raised with him, through your faith in the energy of that God who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you also, at one time dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your sensual nature, he has made alive together with himself. For he forgave us all our transgressions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that stood against us and was hostile to us, and took it out of our way, nailing it to his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>Principalities and powers he disarmed, and openly displayed them as his trophies, when he triumphed over them in the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Therefore do not permit any one to sit in judgment on you in regard to what you may eat or drink, or in regard to feast-days or new moons or sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>These were a shadow of things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no man at his will defraud you of your prize through his false humility and worship of the angels, taking his stand on the visions he has seen, and vainly puffed up by his material mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>instead of keeping connection with the Head from the whole body draws nourishment for all its needs by the joints which bind it; and is knit together, and grows with a divine growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you died with Christ to the worlds rudimentary notions, why, as if you still lived in the world, do you submit yourselves to dogmatisms found on teachings and doctrines of men -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>such as "Do not handle this," "You must not taste that," "Do not touch this" -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>all things which are intended to perish in the using?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>For these precepts, although they have a show of wisdom with their self-imposed devotions and fastings and bodily austerities, are of no real value against the indulgence of the carnal appetites.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If you then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ abides, seated on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your heart on things above, not on earthly things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ, who is our life, appears, then will you also appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>So slay your baser inclinations. fornication, impurity, appetite,  unnatural desires, and the greed which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>These things are ever bringing down the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>among whom you once led your daily life when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you also must renounce them all. Anger, passion, and ill-  will must be put away; slander, too, and foul talk, so that they may never soil your lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Lie not one to another, but strip off the old self with its doings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and put on that new self which is continually made over according to the likeness of its Creator, into full understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>In it that new creation there is no "Greek and Jew," "circumcised and uncircumcised," "barbarian," "Scythian," "slave," "free man," but Christ is all, and in us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Therefore, as Gods chosen people, consecrated and beloved, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindness, humility, gentleness,  good temper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>bearing with one another and forgiving each other, if any one has a grievance against another. Just as Christ the Lord forgave you, so must you forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>Over them all bind on love, which is the girdle of completeness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>Let the peace of Christ, to which also you were called in one body,  rule in your hearts, and show yourselves thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ have its home in you richly, in all wisdom.  Teach and admonish one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, ever singing with grace in your hearts unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you do, whether in word of in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God our Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting for Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, be loving to your wives, and be not cross or surly with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is well pleasing in Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not harass your children, lest you make them spiritless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Slaves, obey in all things your earthly masters, not with eye-  service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of purpose, out of reverence for your Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever you do, do it heartily as for the Lord, and not for men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>You know that from the Lord you will receive reward of the inheritance, for you are the Lord Christs slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>For he who wrongs another will be paid back for his wrong-doing, and there will be no favoritism.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, deal justly and fairly with your slaves, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Be unwearied in prayer, and keep awake in it when giving thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>Keep on praying for me, too, that God may open for me a door of utterance to speak the secret truth of Christ, for which I am a prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>Pray that I may unfold it as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward those without, buying up your opportunities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech be always gracious, with a savor of salt, and learn how to give every man a fitting answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you all that concerns me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I have sent him with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, one of your own number, for this very purpose, to let you know how I am,  and to cheer your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>They will inform you of all that goes on here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, salutes you, and Marcus, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, make him welcome), and Jesus surnamed Justas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God, belonging to the circumcision, who have been any comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, one of yourselves, salutes you, a slave of Christ who is always agonizing for you in his prayers, that you may stand firm,  mature, and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I can testify to his deep interest in you and in those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, salutes you, and so does Demas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Salute the brothers in Laodicea; Nympha also, and the church which meets at her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is read also in the church of Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And tell Archippas to take heed to the ministry which he has received in the Lord, that he may fulfill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>I, Paul, add this farewell in my own handwriting. Do not forget these chains of mine. Grace be with you.</verse>
