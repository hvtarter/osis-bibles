  <div type='book' osisID='1Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silas and Timothy. To the church of the Thessalonians which is in God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be to you, and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>I am continually thanking God for all, always making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>as I call to mind your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>For I know, O brothers, beloved of God, that he has chosen you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>for my gospel did not come to you in word only, but in power also,  and in the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction. For you know also the manner in which I behaved myself among you for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>Moreover, you began to follow the pattern I set you, and the Lords also, receiving the word with joy in the Holy Spirit, although amid severe persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>Thus you became a pattern to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For the word of the Lord has been sounded forth from you, and its sound has been heard not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where the tidings of your faith toward God have been spread abroad, so that I have no need to speak of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For others, of their own accord, tell about the welcome I had from you, and how you turned to God from your idols, to be slaved of a true and living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to await for the coming of his Son from the heavens, the Son whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, our Deliverer from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, that my visit to you did not fail of its purpose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>for you remember that although I had already borne ill-treatment and insult at Philippi, I took courage in my God to tell you the gospel of God, in the face of much opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For my preaching was not grounded on a delusion, or on impure motives, on in deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as my fitness to be entrusted with the gospel has been tested and approved by God, I so speak, not to please men, but to please God, who is testing my motives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For as you well know, I never resorted to flattery, nor to any pretext for enriching myself. God is my witness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Now was I seeking glory from men, either yourselves or others,  although I might have exercised authority as Christs apostle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>On the contrary I showed myself among you as gentle as a mother,  when she tenderly nurses her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So in my fond affection it was my joy to give you, not only the gospel of God, but my very life also, because you had become dear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>You recall, brothers, my labor and toil; how, while working at my trade day and night, so as not to become a burden to any of you, I proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses - and so is God - how pure and just and blameless was my behavior among you believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>You know how I was wont to treat each of you as a father treats his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>exhorting and imploring and adjuring each one among you to lead a life worthy of the God who called you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this reason also I am giving continual thanks to God, because when you heard from me the spoken word of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as the word of God (which in truth it is), who himself is effectually at work in you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus; and you in your turn suffered at the hands of your fellow citizens persecutions like to those which they endured from the Jews -</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>The men who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out - they are displeasing to God, and are the enemies of all mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>They forbid me to speak to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation. They continue always to fill up the measure of their sins;  but the wrath of God is come upon them to the full!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But I, my brothers, although torn from you for a short season (in presence, not in heart), made eager efforts to behold you face to face with strong longing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>For that reason I would fain have visited you - I, Paul, again and again - but Satan hindered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is my hope, or joy? What is the victors wreath in which I exult? What but your own selves in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming! For you are my pride and my delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>And so, when I could no longer bear it, I made up my mind to be left behind at Athens, all alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>I sent Timothy, my brother and Gods fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and to hearten you in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>So that no one should be shaken by these troubles-for you know well that we are appointed to troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For even when I was with you I used to tell you beforehand that I was to suffer affliction; and so it proved, as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>So, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that my labor had been in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now that Timothy has returned from you to me, and has brought good news of your faith and love, and that you are still holding me in affectionate remembrance, always longing to see me as I also am longing to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>I have been comforted, my brothers, in regard to you, in spite of all my distress and affliction over your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now I am really living, if you are standing firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanksgiving can I render again to God in your behalf, in return for all the joy which you cause me in the presence of my God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day I am praying earnestly that I may see you face to face, and may perfect whatever is yet lacking in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ,  direct my path to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>Meanwhile, may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all men, even as I do toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>And so may he establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, my brothers, I continue to beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as you learned of me how to walk so as to please God - and you are actually doing so - that you abound in it yet more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what charges I laid upon you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is Gods will, even your sanctification; that you should abstain from sexual vice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That each one should learn how to take a wife in purity and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles who know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man overreach or take advantage of his brother in such matters, because "the Lord takes vengeance" in all these things, as also I repeatedly forewarned you and testified to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God has not called us for uncleanness, but in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>So that he who rejects this is not rejecting man, but the God who gave you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>It is not needed that I should write to you about brotherly love;  for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>As indeed you do love all the brothers in Macedonia. But I exhort you, brothers, to abound in this yet more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>Also, that you endeavor to live quietly and to mind your own business, and to work with your hands (as I charged you).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>So that your conduct may be seemly toward those that are without,  and that you may not need help from any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, about those who are falling asleep. You must not sorrow like other men, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we really believe that Jesus died and rose again, so even so will God through Jesus bring with him those also who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this I tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living,  who survive unto the coming of the Lord, will in no wise precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself with a shout, with the voice of an archangel,  and with the trumpet of God will descend from heaven. Then the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>And afterwards we who are alive, who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>So comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>Now as to the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>You yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>While men are saying "Peace and safety," then, like birth-pangs upon a woman with child, destruction will come upon them suddenly. In no wise will they escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that "the Day" should come upon you like a bandit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>For you are all sons of light, and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>So then let us not be sleeping as do the rest, but let us be watchful and self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who are sleeping, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us who are of the day be self-controlled, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>He died for us, in order that whether we are keeping vigil in life or sleeping in death we may ever be living together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>So comfort one another, and try to build one another up, as indeed you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>I entreat you, brothers, to acknowledge those who are toiling among you and are your leaders in the Lord, and give you counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>Esteem them very highly in love for their works sake. Live in peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And, brothers, we urge you to admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, lose patience with none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>Take care that none of you ever return evil for evil, but always pursue what is kind to one another and to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Always be joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophesyings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>But try all, holding fast to the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Hold aloof from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>May the God of peace consecrate you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>He who calls you is faithful; he will fulfil my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you, in the name of the Lord, to have this letter read to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
