  <div type='book' osisID='Phlm'>
      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>To my beloved friend and coworker Philemon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>to my sister Apphia, to my fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church which meets at Philemons house. From Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and brother Timothy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace and peace be to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I am ever mentioning you in my prayers, and giving thanks to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I am hearing of your love and of the faith which you hold,  not only toward the Lord Jesus Christ, but toward all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>And I pray that your participation may become effectual, as you come to acknowledge every good thing which is in you to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have great joy and comfort in your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>And so, although I might be bold in Christ to dictate to you what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for loves sake, I rather beseech you, I, Paul, an old man, and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech you for my son, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in these chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Once you found him "unprofitable," but now he is "profitable" to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back to you, he himself, that is, my very heart!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I could wish to retain him at my side, so that he might minister to me in your stead, in my bonds for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your consent I was unwilling to do anything, so that your kindness to me might be of your own free will, and not of compulsion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps for this reason you were separated from him for an hour, in order that you might have him back forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a brother beloved;  especially dear to me, but how much more to you, both as a man and a fellow Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>And if he has wronged you at all, or is owing you anything, charge that to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul am writing this in my own handwriting, "I will repay you."  But I will not mention that you owe me, over and over, your very soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Come my brother, let me have joy in the Lord because of you! Refresh my heart in Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Because I am thoroughly persuaded of your obedience, I have written you, knowing full well that you will do by me what I am asking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Please also prepare for me a lodging, for I am hoping by your prayers to be restored to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
