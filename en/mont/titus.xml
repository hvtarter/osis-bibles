  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>To Titus, my true son in a common faith, from Paul, a slave of God,  and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Gods elect, and to the knowledge of the truth which goes with piety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>I write in hope of life eternal which God who never lies, promised before times eternal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but manifested in his own time; that word of his in proclaiming which I have been entrusted by command of God our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you might set right the things left unfinished, and appoint presbyters in every city as I had instructed you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>men who are blameless, the husband of one wife, with believing children who are not accused of riot or insubordination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For indeed a presiding officer, as Gods steward, ought to be blameless, not self-willed or quick-tempered, not a drunkard or violent, or greedy of filthy lucre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but he must be hospitable, a lover of the good, sober-minded, just,  holy, self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>He must hold to the faithful word according to the teaching, so that he may be able both to encourage by sound teaching, and to confute our opponents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many individuals who are unruly, empty talkers and deceivers, particularly those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>for they upset whole households and, for filthy lucres sake, teach what they ought not to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>By one of their own number, by a prophet of their own, it has been said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. So rebuke them sharply,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>so as to make them sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>All things are pure to the pure; but to the contaminated and the faithless nothing is pure, nay, their very minds and consciences are tainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but by their deeds they disown him; in that they are detestable, disobedient, and reprobate for good work of any sort.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But do you, on your part, speak what becomes sound teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that the older men be self-controlled, serious and sober-minded,  sound in faith, in love, in patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>that older women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers or slaves to much wine, but teachers of what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>They should train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind and submissive to their husbands, in order that Gods message be not maligned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>The younger men exhort to be sober-minded; in every respect showing yourself an example of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In your teaching be serious and sincere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>Let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that our opponents may be ashamed because they find no evil things to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort slaves to be obedient to their own masters, and to be well-  pleasing to them in every respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not to contradict nor pilfer, but to exhibit praiseworthy trustworthiness in every thing, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>"For Gods grace has shined forth bringing salvation to all men</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>And schooling us to renounce impiety and evil passions, And to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>While we look for the blessed hope and epiphany of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>He gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a people zealous of good works."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Thus speak, exhort, reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be submissive to their rulers and authorities; let them be obedient, ready for every good work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>they must speak evil of none, they must not be quarrelsome, but gentle, showing perfect meekness toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we were ourselves once foolish, disobedient, deceived, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, passing our lives in malice and envy. We were hateful, and we hated one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness of God our Saviour, And his love toward men shined forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>He saved us, not because of any deeds that we had done in righteousness, But because of his own pity for us. He saved us by that washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>In order that being justified by his grace, We might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This saying is trustworthy. On this I want you to firmly insist;  that those who have faith in God must be careful to maintain honest occupations. Such counsels are good and profitable for men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and dissensions and wranglings about the law; for these are unprofitable and empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>After a first and second admonition, refuse a man who is causing divisions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>you may be sure that such a man is perverted and sinning, and is self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me in Nicopolis as quickly as you can, for I have arranged to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Speed Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey diligently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>Let them want nothing, and "let our people learn to devote themselves to honest work to supply the necessities of their teachers," so that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with us salute you. Salute those who love me in faith.  Grace be with you all.</verse>
