      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The Elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>I pray that you may prosper, beloved, in every way, and be in good health, even as your soul is prospering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I was glad when brothers came and bore testimony to your truth,  as indeed you are passing your life in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are passing their lives in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>You are acting faithfully, beloved, in whatever you are doing for the brothers and the strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>They have borne testimony to your love before the church. You will do well to speed them on their way worthily of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>since for the sake of the Name they have started out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>Hence we ought to support such, so that we may become fellow workers for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I have written somewhat to the church; but Diotrephes, who love to take the lead among them, does not receive me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Do them when I come I will recall to mind the deeds which he is doing, prating against me with wicked words. Not satisfied with that,  he refuses to receive the brothers, forbids those that would receive them, and excommunicates them from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Do not imitate what is evil, beloved, but that which is good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has never gazed on God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>All men bear testimony to Demetrius, and so does the truth itself. I also bear testimony to him; and you know that my testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I have a great deal to write to you, but I do not want to write you with pen and ink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>I am hoping soon to see you, and then we shall talk face to face.  Peace be to you! The friends send their salutation. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
