        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The Elder to the Elect Lady and her children, whom I love in truth,  and not only I, but also all those who have come to know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>I love you for the sake of the truth which is abiding in us and will be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Fathers Son, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I am greatly rejoiced to find some of your children leading their lives in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I am entreating you, Lady, not as though I were writing some new commandment to you, but one which we have had from the beginning,  let us love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we should lead our lives according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should pass your life in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>I say this because many deceivers are gone forth into the world,  those who deny the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have wrought, but that you receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever is going ahead, and is not abiding in the teachings of Christ, does not possess God; but he who is abiding in the teaching possesses both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one come to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, nor give him any greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For the man who greets him shares in his wicked work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>I have many things to write to you, but I would not write them with paper and ink. I hope to come to you and to talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister send you greeting.</verse>
