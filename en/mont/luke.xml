  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Seeing that many have taken it in hand to draw up an account of those matters which have been fully established among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they reported them to us, who were from beginning eye-  witnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also accurately, from the very beginning, to write them to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty of the story which you have been taught by the word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the reign of Herod, King of Judea, there was a certain priest,  named Zachariah, belonging to the class of Abijah. He had a wife named Elizabeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>who was a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous in the sight of the Lord, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>Now they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and both were far advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now while Zachariah was acting as priest before God in the due course of his class, it fell to his lot, according to the custom of priesthood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>to enter into the sanctuary of the Lord and to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were without, praying at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And as he saw him Zachariah was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the Angel said to him. "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>"And he shall be to you a joy and an exultation, and many shall rejoice over his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, "He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, "He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit from the hour of his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>"And shall win many of the sons of Israel to the Lord, their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>"He shall go before Him in the wisdom and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>"How shall I be sure of this?" said Zachariah to the Angel. "For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>"I am Gabriel," answered the angel, "who stand in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>"And now you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words -  Words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zachariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out he could not speak to them, and then they knew that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>As soon as his term of priestly service was ended he went home;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>and after those days Elizabeth, his wife, Conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"This has the Lord done for me. He has now deigned to take the away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee, called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a maiden betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.  Her name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel went in and said to her. "Joy to you, highly favored one!  "The Lord is with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>Mary was greatly agitated at his word, and was revolving in her mind what this salutation could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>when the angel said to her. "Fear not Mary, for you have found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>"And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you shall call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High.  "And the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>"and he shall reign over the House of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel. "How can this be? For I have no husband?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>"The Holy Spirit shall come upon you," said the angel, "and the power of the most High shall overshadow you, and therefore the holy offspring which is born, shall be called the son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>"And behold your kinswoman, Elizabeth, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this was the sixth month with her that was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>"For no word of God shall be void of power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said. "Behold I am Lords slave. Let it be to me as you have said." Then the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Soon after this Mary set out and hastened unto the hill-country to a town in Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and there she came into the house of Zachariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And when Elizabeth heard her salutation, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and called out with a loud cry. "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>"But why is this honor done me, that the mother of my Lord should come me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>"For behold when the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped with joy within my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>"And blessed is she who believed that the Lords words spoken to her would be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said. "My soul doth magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>"My spirit exults in the God, who is my Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>"For he has regarded the humiliation of his slave, And from this hour all ages will count me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>"For he who is mighty has done great things for me; And holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>"His mercy is unto generations and generations on those who reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>"He has showed strength with his arm. "He has scattered proud in the imagination of their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>"he has put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted those of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>"The hungry he has filled with good things, But the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>"He has helped Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>"As he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now when the time of Elizabeths delivery was come, she gave birth to a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>and came on the eighth day to circumcise the child. They were about to call him "Zachariah," after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>when his mother said, "No, he is to be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>Said they, "You have no relatives of that name!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>Then they asked his father by signs what he wished to call the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>So he asked for a writing tablet and wrote down, "His name is John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Every one was surprised, and at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And there came a great fear upon all in the neighborhood; and throughout the hill country of Judea all these sayings were much talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All the story laid it up in their hearts, saying "What, then, will this child be?" For the Lords hands was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father, Zachariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, For he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>"And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>"As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets Which have been since the world began</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>To deliver us from our enemies, and from the power Of all who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>"He showed mercy to our forefathers, He remembered his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>"The oath which he swore to Abraham, our forefather,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>"That he we should be delivered out of the Hand of our enemies, And should serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>"In holiness and righteousness before him All our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>"And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Most High, For thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare the way</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>"To give to his people a knowledge of salvation Through the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>"Through the heart of mercy of our God, Whereby the Dayspring from on high shall visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>"To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, And to guide our feet into the paths of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and became strong in the Spirit, and remained in the desert till the day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>In those days Augustus Caesar issued an edict for a census of the whole inhabited world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first census, When Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And every one went to be registered, each to the town to which he belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city if Nazareth,  into Judea, to Davids town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>He went to be registered along with Mary, who was espoused to him,  and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>But while they were there the days were fulfilled for her delivery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,  keeping watch over their flocks by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>When suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they feared with a great fear. The angel said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>"Have no fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,  which shall be for all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>"For unto you born this day in there is born in Davids town a Saviour, who is the Anointed Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>"And this is a sign to you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly army praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory to God in the highest, And in earth peace among men who please him"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>Now when the angels had left them, and gone away to heaven, the shepherds said to one to another, "Let us go now even to Bethlehem,  and see this saying which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>so they made haste, and came and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they had seen, they made known about the words which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it were astonished at the things which were told to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary treasured up all those words, Often pondering on on them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying God and praising him for all those things that they had seen and heard, even as it was told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When eight days had passed, and the time had come to circumcise him,  he was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before his conception in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days for purification according to the law of Moses had passed, they took him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>as it is written in the law of Moses, Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord A pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Now there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon. He was righteous and devout, and was waiting for the consolation of Israel.  The Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>Now it has been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lords Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came into the Temple, led by the Spirit. and when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Now lettest thou thy slave depart, O Master; according to thy word in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>"Because my eyes had seen the salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>"Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>"A light for the unveiling of the Gentiles And the glory of thy people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And while his father and mother were marveling at the words that were spoken concerning him, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>"Behold this child is set for the falling and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>Yea, and a sword shall pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in age, having lived with her husband seven years, after her girlhood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and then being a widow even for fourscore and four years. She departed not from the temple, but worshiped with the fasting and prayer, night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>She came up at that very hour, and gave thanks to God, and spoke of the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>As soon as all that the law required had been done, they returned to Galilee to their own town, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew and became strong, becoming full of wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents were accustomed to go up to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old they went up, as was customary, at the time of the feast</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>After spending the full number of days they started home, but the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother did not know this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposed that he was in the company, and went a days journey.  Then they hunted for him among his kinsfolk and acquaintance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>On the third day they found him sitting in the Temple, among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>When they saw him they were astonished, and his mother said to him "Child, why have you treated us so? Behold your father and I have been looking for you in anguish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He answered, "Why is it that you have been looking for me, did you not realize that I had to be in my Fathers house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand the words that he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was always obedient to them. But his mother kept treasuring up all these incidents in her hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus was ever advancing in wisdom and in status and in favor with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip, tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias, tetrarch of Abilene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the Desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And Johnwent into all the region about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah. The voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare the way for God, make straight paths for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every ravine shall be filled up, Every hill and mountain shall be laid low, The crooked shall be made straight, And the rough roads smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>So Johnused to say to the crowd of those who were going out to be baptized by him. "You breed of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Then bring forth fruit befitting your penitence, and do not begin to say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you that God is able to raise up sons to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And now truly the axe is already laid at the root of the trees. So every tree which is not bearing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the crowd began to ask him questions. "What shall we do then?"  they asked. In reply he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>"If you have two shirts share with him who has none; and let him who has food do the same."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>There came to him publicans also to be baptized, and they said to him, "Master, what must we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, "Exact no more than the sum allowed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>The soldiers also repeatedly questioned him, saying, "And we, what shall we do?" "Do not intimidate any one," he replied, "nor lay false charges, and be content with your pay."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And while the people were in expectation, and all men were debating in their hearts about John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>whether perhaps he were the Christ, Johnanswered, saying to all of them. "I indeed am baptizing you in water, but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing-floor thoroughly, and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff will he burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>With many other exhortations then Johndeclared the gospel to the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>but Herod, the Tetrarch, when reproved by him because of Herodias,  his brothers wife, and because of all the wicked deeds that he had done,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, came back from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days, all the time tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>He ate nothing during these days, and at the close of them he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God tell this stone to become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written that not by bread alone shall man live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>And the devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time, and the devil said to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and caused him to stand upon the Temple roof, and said to him. "If you really are the Son of God throw yourself down here;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and, as was his custom, he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And there was handed him the roll of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling it he found the place where it was written,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And they all spoke well of him, and marveled at the words of charm that fell from his lips. "Is not this the son of Joseph?" they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>Jesus answered. "Doubtless you will quote the proverb to me,  "Physician, heal thyself! Do also here in your own country all that we hear that you have done in Capernaum."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>they rose, hurried him outside the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, intending to cast him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he, passing through the midst of them, took his departure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and continued to teach the people on the Sabbath Days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>They were deeply impressed by his teaching because his speech was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. He cried out, in a loud voice, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>"Ha! Jesus of Nazareth, what business have you with us? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, you holy one of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quiet! Come out of him." And when the demon had thrown the man down before them, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>All were amazed, and began to ask one another, saying. "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the talk about him spread into every locality in the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>Now when he rose and left the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, where Simons mother-in-law lay sick of a great fever. And they kept entreating him for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and at once she arose and ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>At sunset all they who had any sick with any sort of disease brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons also came out of many, screaming and saying, "You are the Son of God." But he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak,  because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was daybreak he left the town, and went away to a solitary place; and the crowd kept seeking him. Coming at length upon him, they attempted to detain him so that he should not leave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them. "I must preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other towns also; for that is what I was sent to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>On one occasion when he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, the crowd pressed upon him to listen to the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>But he saw two fishing-boats on the shore of the lake; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>He went on board one of the boats which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push out a little way from land. Then he sat down and continued to teach the crowd from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Push out into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>"Master," answered Simon, "although we toiled all night, we took nothing; but at your bidding I will let down the nets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fish;  and their nets began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at the knees of Jesus,  exclaiming, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>(For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the haul of fish which they had made;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so were Simons partners, Jamesand John, sons of Zebedee.) But Jesus answered Simon. "Fear not; from this time on, you will be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>So when they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>Another time when he was in one of their cities, there was a man there full of leprosy. And he, upon seeing Jesus, fell on his face and implored him. "Lord," he said, "if only you choose you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And he stretched out his hand and touching him, said. "I do choose;  be made clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And instantly the leprosy left him. Jesus ordered him to tell no one, "But be off," he said, "show yourself to the priest, and make the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But all the more the report about him continued to spread; and great crowds began to come together to hear him, and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But Jesus himself habitually withdrew into solitary places, and there used to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day he was teaching, and near to him were seated Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold there came men carrying a paralytic on a bed; and they tried to bring him and lay him before Jesus, but they could not because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>So they went up on the roof, and let him down through the tiling,  with his bed, into the crowd, before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil. "Who is this?" they asked, "speaking blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Conscious of their cavilings, Jesus answered, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>"What is this caviling in your hearts? Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise and walk?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralytic), "I bid you rise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And instantly he arose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went away to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Astonishment fell upon them all, and they began to glorify God, and they were filled with awe, and they said, "We have seen strange things today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this he went forth and noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi,  sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>He rose, left everything, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi also made him a great reception at his house. There was a large party of tax-gatherers and others who were dining with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes began complaining to his disciples, saying, "Why are you eating and drinking with tax-  gatherers and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them saying. "They who are well have no need of a physician, but they who are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am not come to call the righteous but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Again they said unto him. "Why do the disciples of Johnfast frequently, and make supplications, as also do the disciples of the Pharisees, but your disciples are eating and drinking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>"Can you make the bridal party fast," he asked, while the bridegroom is still with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>"But there is coming a day when the Bridegroom will have been taken away from them; then at that time they will fast."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He also told them a parable. "No one," he said, "tears a piece from a new garment, and patches it upon an old one; otherwise he will tear the new garment, and the patch from the new will not mend the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>"Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins, and will itself be spilled, and the skins be destroyed</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>"But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>"And no man after drinking old wine, wishes for new; for he says,  "The old is better.""</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>It happened that on a Sabbath he was going through the wheat-fields.  His disciples were picking the ears and eating the wheat, rubbing it out with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>And some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>"Have you never read," answered Jesus, "what David did when he and his followers were hungry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>"How he entered into Gods house and took and ate the Presented Loaves, and gave some to his followers, loaves which none must eat but the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>"THE SON OF MAN," he told them, "IS LORD EVEN OVER THE SABBATH."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and was teaching; and there was there a man whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>Now the Scribes and Pharisees kept watching to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to bring on accusations to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>He was all along aware of their thoughts; and he said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand there in the midst."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>So he rose and stood. Then Jesus said to them. "I ask you whether it is lawful on the Sabbath Day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>Then he looked round about on them in anger, and said to him,  "Stretch out your hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>He did so; and his hand was restored. But they were filled with fury, and they began to talk over together what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>It happened about that time that he went out into the mountain to pray. He continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>And when day dawned he called his disciples, and from among them he selected twelve, whom also he called Apostles missionaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.14'>They were Simon, whom he had also called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Jude the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who was the traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>With these he came down till he reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of his disciples and a great many people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. These came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>Those who were tormented by unclean spirits were healed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>The whole crowd were trying to touch him, because power emanated from him and cured them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Then raising his eyes upon his disciples he began to say to them.  "Blessed are you poor, For the kingdom of God is yours.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>"and so I did not think myself worthy to come to you; but speak the word, and let my man be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>"For I also am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers under me. And I say to one come, and he comes, and to my slave do this or that, and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>But when Jesus heard this he was astonished and he turned and said to the crowd that was following him, "I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And those who had been sent, on returning to the house, found the slave well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon afterward he went to a city called Nain, accompanied by his disciples, and a great crowd of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he drew near the gate of the city, behold, they were there carrying out one who was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>A great crowd accompanied her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came near and touched the bier; the bearer stopped and he said, "Young man, I bid you to rise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he who was dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And awe took hold on them all, and they began to glorify God saying.  "A great prophet has risen among us;" and, "God has visited his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And the report of what Jesus had done went forth throughout Judea and the surrounding regions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>Johns disciples brought him word of all these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>and, calling a certain two disciples to him, he sent them to Jesus,  to say, "Are you the coming one, or if we are to expect another?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>So the men came to Jesus and said, "Johnthe Baptist has sent us to ask you if you are the coming one, or if we are to expect another."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that moment Jesus was healing many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he was freely giving their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>So he answered them. "Go your way, tell Johnwhat you have seen and heard. How the blind are seeing, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are hearing the proclamations of glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>"And blessed is he who finds no cause of stumbling in me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When Johns messengers were gone he began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What went out you out to the desert to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>"But what you went out to behold? A man clothed in soft robes?  Behold, men who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are in kings palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>"But what went you to see? A prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>"Yes, I tell you and more than a prophet. This is he who it is written. "Behold I send a messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>"I tell you that among all that are born of women not one is greater than John; yet he that is little in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>On hearing this all the people and the tax-gatherers acknowledged the justice of God by being baptized with the baptism of John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>but the Pharisees and lawyers who had refused his baptism,  frustrated Gods purpose for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>"To What are they like, they are like children sitting in the market-  place and calling to one another. "We have piped to you, they say,  and you have not danced; we have wailed, and you did not cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>"For Johnthe Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine,  and you say, He has a demon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>"The son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>"Nevertheless, wisdom is justified by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees kept urging him to dine, so he entered the house and reclined at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>Now there was a woman who was in the city, a sinner and when she knew that that Jesus was reclining at meat in the Pharisees house,  she brought an alabaster vase of perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind, at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with her hair, while she tenderly kissed his feet, and poured the perfume over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>When he noticed this the Pharisee, who had invited him, said to himself, "If this man were really a prophet he would have perceived who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, and would know that she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus then spoke to him. "Simon, I have a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>"There were once to men," said Jesus, "in debt to one money- lender.  One owed him fifty pounds; the other five.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>"When they had nothing pay he forgave them with such charm. "Tell me, then, which of these will love him most?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>"I take it," said Simon, "the one he forgave the most."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>"You have rightly judged." answered Jesus, and turning to the woman,  he said to Simon. "Do you see this woman? When I came into your house you gave me no water for my feet; but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>"You gave me no kiss; but she, since she came in, has never ceased tenderly kissing my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>"you never anointed my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with my feet with perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>"This is why I tell you that her sins, many as they are, are forgiven, for her love is great; but he who is forgiven little, loves but little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>"Your sins are forgiven," he said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Then the other guest began to say among themselves, "Who is this even to forgive sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But he said to the woman. "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>It happened shortly afterwards that he began to go from town to town and village to village, preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>The twelve were with him, and certain women whom he had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases. Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons have been driven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who used to minister to him out of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>As a great crowd was gathering, and men of town after town kept restoring to him, he spoke a parable to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>"A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed some fell by the wayside, and was trodden under foot, and the wild birds ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>"Some other seed dropped on the rock, as soon as it grew it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>"Another part fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>"But some fell on good soil, and grew up, and brought forth fruit, a hundredfold." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear with, let him listen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>Then his disciples began to interrupt him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He answered. "To you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God; But all others are taught in parables so that seeing they shall not see, and hearing they shall not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>"This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>"Those by the wayside are people who hear, but then comes the devil and carries off the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>"Those on the rock are people who, upon hearing, receive the word with joy; but they have no root. For a time indeed they all believe,  but in time of temptation they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>"And that which fell upon thorns is those who have heard, but as they go on their way of word is choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life; so they bring no fruit of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>"And that in the good soil is those who have listened to the message and, in an honest and good heart, hold fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>"When he lights a lamp no one covers it with a vase or hides it under a bed; he puts it on a lamp-stand so whoever may behold the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>"For is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed; there is nothing secret which shall not be made known and come to the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>"Take heed, then, how you listen. for he who has, to him shall it be given, but from him who has not, shall be taken away even what he has."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>There came to him his mother and his brothers, and they could not reach him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>But some one told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>"My mother and brothers," he answered, "are those who listen to the word of God and obey it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it happened that one of these days he got into a boat, And him his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us cross to the other side of the lake."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>So they set sail. While they were sailing he fell asleep. And there fell on the lake a squall of wind, so that the boat began to fill,  and they to be in deadly peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>Then they came to him and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are lost!" Then he awoke, and rebuked the winds and the raging of the sea. They ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>"Where is your faith?" he asked them, In their terror they were filled with amazement, and said to one another, "Who is this who commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>Then they put in at the country of Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When he landed here he was met by a certain townsman who was possessed by demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes and nor lived in any house, but in tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus he cried out, and fell down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed. "What have we to do with you, Jesus, you son of God Most High? I implore you to torment me not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him and held him, and they again and again kept him under guard, and put him in chains and fetters. But he would break his bonds asunder, as he was driven by the demon in to the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>So Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he answered, "Legion"  (for many demons had entered into him).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>So they besought Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the hillside, and the demons begged him to give them leave to enter them. He gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The demons came out of the man, and entered into the swine; the herd rushed violently down over the cliff into the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And those who saw what had happened fled and reported it in the town and the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then the people came out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the demons had gone sitting clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus. And they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Then those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole populace of Gadarenes and the surrounding territory besought Jesus to go away from them; for they were terror-stricken.  So he entered a boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man out of whom the demons had gone kept begging him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your home, and tell them all that God has done for you."  So he went away and throughout the whole city he published how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And as Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>for they were all waiting for him. Just then there came a man named Jarius, and he was ruler in the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus  feet and begged him to come into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had only one daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went the crowds continued to press in on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who for twelve years had had a hemorrhage, and had spent on doctors all that she had, but none had cured her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came close behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and instantly the hemorrhage ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>"Who is that touched me?" said Jesus and when everybody denied it,  Peter said, "Master, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing upon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said. "Some one did touch me; for I perceived that the power was proceeding out of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Then the woman, who saw that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and falling down before him, stated before the people for what reason she had touched him, and how she had been instantly healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>"Daughter," he said "your faith has made you well, go on into peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>As he was speaking some one came from the house of the synagogue,  saying. "Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the Master."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus heard and answered. "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>So he came to the house, and would not permit anyone to go in with him except Peter and Johnand James, and the father and Mother of the little girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>The people were weeping and bewailing her, but he said. "Stop your wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They began to laugh him to scorn, because they knew well that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took her by the hand and called to her, "Little daughter,  rise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned and instantly she stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>He bade them to get her some food. Her parents were amazed; but he forbade them to tell any one what had been done.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Then he called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and sent them out to preach the kingdom of God, and heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them. "Take nothing for your journey, neither staff,  nor bag, nor bread, nor money, and do not have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>"Into whatever house you enter, there stay, and thence depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>"If any one will not receive you, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave this town, as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they went forth, and walked from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod, the Tetrarch, heard of all that was happening; and he was perplexed because of its being said by someone that Johnwas risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah had appeared; and by others that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>So Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this of whom I am hearing such reports," And he kept seeking to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>On their return the apostles told him what they had done. and he took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowd learned this they followed him. He received them kindly and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed restored to good health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>But now the day began to decline, and the twelve came to him and said. "Send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and surrounding the country to lodge and buy provisions; for here we are on a solitary place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>"Do you yourselves give them food," he answered. "We have nothing,"  they replied "Except five loaves, and a couple fish, unless you mean for us to go and buy provisions for all the crowd."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>(For there were about five thousand men.) "Make them sit down in table-companies, of about fifty each," he said to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>This they did, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up in heaven, he blessed them, broke them in pieces, and began to giving to his disciples to apportion among the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>So they ate and were filled, all of them. And there was picked up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Now it happened that while he was praying by himself, the disciples were with him, and he asked them a question. "Who do the crowd think I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>"Johnthe Baptist," they answered, "But others say Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets is risen again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>Then he said to them, "But who do you say I am? Then Peter answered saying, "The Christ of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>Then he strictly forbade them to tell this to any one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>and he said, "The Son of man must suffer much, and be restricted by the elders and high priests and scribes and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said to all. "If any man wills to follow me, Let him renounce self and take up his cross daily and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>"For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>"For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose or forfeit himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my teachings, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own and in his Fathers glory, and in that of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>"But I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after this it happened that Jesus took Peter,  James, and John, and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying the appearances of his countenance became different, and his clothing became white and dazzling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And suddenly there were two men talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>These appeared in glory and talked about his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but when they were fully awake they saw his glory, and the two men were standing beside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And when they were preparing to depart from him Peter said to Jesus.  "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah" - not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And while he was saying this, there came a cloud and began to overshadow them; and they were awestruck as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my chosen one; listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice ceased Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no one at that time about what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>It happened the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, that a large crowd came to meet him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>and a man called out of the crowd saying. "Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son; for he is my only boy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>"and behold a spirit seizes hold of him, and rudely he shouts out,  It convulses him till he foams; indeed it will hardly leave off bruising him sorely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>"I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>"O faithless and perverse generation," said Jesus, "how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>But while he was yet coming the demon dashed him down, and cruelly convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all awestruck at the mighty power of God. But while everyone was marveling at what he was doing, he said to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>"Let these words sink into your ears; for the son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying; it was hidden from them so that they perceived it not, and they were sore afraid to ask him about his saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Now there arose a dispute among them as to which one of them was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>And Jesus who knew the dispute that was in their hearts, took a young child, and placed him by his side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>then he said to them. "Whoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me; and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me. For it is the lowliest among you all who is great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>"Master," said John, "we saw a man who was casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said, "Forbid him not, for he who is not against you is for you."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>For as they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>They answered, "The Master needs it."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>So he rode on, while they kept throwing their garments in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And when now he was coming near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and to praise God with a loud voice for the almighty works they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>They cried, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!  Peace in Heaven and glory in the Highest"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>exclaiming. "Oh that at this time you knew, yes, even you, on what your peace depends! But now it is hidden from your eyes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the gospel, there came up the priest and the Scribes with the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>They spoke to him saying. "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things? Who is it that gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>"I will also ask you a question," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>"Was Johns baptism from heaven or from man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>So they reasoned among themselves. "If we say, From heaven, he will ask us, Why did you not believe in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>"And if we say, From man, all the people will stone us, for they were persuaded that Johnwas a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they did not know whence it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>"Nor will I tell you," Jesus answered, "by whose authority I do these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he began to tell the people this parable. "There was a man who planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went to another country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>"At harvest-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers, to ask them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dresser beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>"Then he sent yet a third, and him to they wounded and threw him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>"Then the master of the vineyard said. "What shall I do? I will send my beloved Son; it may be that they will reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>"But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned together, saying.  This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>"So they turned him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What will the master of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>"He will come and destroy those vine-dressers, and will give the vineyard to others."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>He looked at them and said. "Then what does this scripture mean.  "The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>"Every one who falls on that stone will be broken in pieces; but whoever it falls upon will be scattered as dust."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>At this the Scribes and the high priests were seeking to arrest him;  only they were afraid of the people. For they perceived that he had referred to them in this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be honest men,  in order to seize on his speech, and to deliver him up to authority and jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>So they put a question to him saying. "Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not regard any mans person,  but teach the way of God honestly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>"Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their knavery and answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>"Show me a shilling. Whose image and superscription does it bear?"  "Caesars," they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>"Then give to Caesar what belongs to him," he said, "to God give what is Gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>So they could not lay hold of his sayings before the people; and marveling at his answer, they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Next came some of the Sadducees who deny that there is resurrection,  and they asked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>"Teacher, Moses wrote a law for us that if a mans brother should die, but leave no children, his brother should take up his wife and raise up his children for his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>"For indeed they cannot die any more; they are equal to the angels,  and through being sons of the resurrection are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>"But that the dead are raised, even Moses clearly implied in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord. "The God of Abraham,  the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then he went out, and began to go to the Mount of Olives, as was his wont; and his disciples followed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>"Father, if thou art willing, take away this cup from me; but thy will, not mine, be done!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>(And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>When he arose from his prayers, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>and said to them. "Why are you asleep? Get up, and pray that you enter not into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus in order to kiss him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Those who were around him, when they saw what was about to happen,  said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with our swords?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>Then one of them did strike a blow at the high priests slave, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>"Permit me to do this at least," said Jesus, as he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the corps of priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come out to arrest him. "Have ye come for me with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>So they seized him and led him away, and took him to the house of the high priest; while Peter was following him a long way off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>And when they had lighted a fire in the center of the court, and had sat down together, Peter was taking his seat among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>But a certain maid servant saw him taking his seat near the fire and, with a sharp glance at him, she said, "This fellow was with him,  too!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I know nothing about him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>A little later a man saw him, and said, "You too are one of them"  But Peter declared, "Man, I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>But an hour afterwards another man kept insisting, saying. "Really, this fellow was with him. Why, he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>"Man," said Peter, "I do not know what you mean." And immediately,  while he was still speaking, the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter recollected the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "This very day, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And Peter went outside and wept with bitter crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Meanwhile the men who were holding Jesus in custody kept mocking and striking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They would blindfold him and ask him. "Prophesy! Tell who struck you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they said many other insulting things against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>When it became the day the elders if the people met with the high priests and the Scribes and had brought before the Sanhedrin, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>"Are you the Christ? Tell us!" "If I tell you," he answered, "you will not believe;</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole company rose up and brought him to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>and began to accuse him. "We have found this fellow perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and proclaiming that he is the Messiah and King."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him saying, "Certainly I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilate said to the chief priest and the crowd, "I find no harm in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they repeatedly insisted, "He is stirring up the people throughout all Judea with his teaching which started from Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard the word "Galilee" he asked if the man were a Galilean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>and when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who himself happened to be in Jerusalem during those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad. He had long been wanting to see him, because he had heard so much about him, and was hoping to see some miracles performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he had been asking him many questions, but Jesus made no answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Meanwhile the high priests and Scribes were standing around, and continually making accusations to him against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod and his soldiers set him at naught, and mocked him, and throwing about him a gorgeous robe, sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>Herod and Pilate became friends again from that very day; for before they had been at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them. "You brought before me this man as one who incited the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence, and I find no fault in this man regarding the charges that you brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>Neither does Herod; for he sent him back to us. You see that he has done nothing worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore, after flogging him, release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>"Now he had to release to them at the feast one prisoner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>Then the whole crowd shouted out, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(This was a man who had been thrown in prison on account of a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Then Pilate spoke to them again, because he wished to release Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they continued to shout out and say, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>For the third time he appealed to them. "But what crime has he committed? I have found in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore flog him, and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they kept shouting the more insistently, demanding that he should be crucified, and their shouts won the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate gave sentence what they wished should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder,  the man whom they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And when they led him away they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenean, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>He was also followed by a great crowd of people, and of women too,  who were beating their breast and lamenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turned to and said. "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>"but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have never bore children, and the breasts that never suckled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they came to the place called "The Skull," there they crucified him and the criminals also, one upon his right hand, and one upon his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus kept saying, "Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>and the people stood looking on. Even the rulers repeatedly taunted him, saying, "He saved others, let him save himself, if this fellow is indeed the Christ of God, His Chosen One!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>Even the soldiers made sport of him by coming up and offering him sour wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>For there was an inscription over his head, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other, answering, reproved him, saying. "Have you no fear of God even? When you are suffering the same punishment as he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>"We indeed justly, for we are receiving due retribution for what we have done. But he has done no wrong."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Then with a loud cry, Jesus said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit!" And after uttering these words, he yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>When the army captain saw what had happened, he glorified God,  saying, "This man was really innocent!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds who had assembled to see this spectacle, after witnessing what had been done, were returning beating upon their breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all his acquaintances and the women who had been his followers continued to stand at a distance, looking on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good man and a righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>he who came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and who was on the watch for the kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the designs and deed of the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate, and begged for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>Then taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no man has ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was near at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>Then the women who had accompanied him out of Galilee followed after, and noted the tomb, and how his body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>On the Sabbath Day they rested in obedience to the commandment, but in the deep dawn of the first day of the week they took the spices which they had prepared, and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were still perplexed over this, it happened that the two men stood near them in dazzling raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>They were terrified, and bowed down their faces to the ground, but the men said to them. "Why are you seeking him who lives among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>"He is not here; he is risen. Do you remember how he told you when he was still in Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>that the Son of man had to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men,  and to be crucified, and to rise on the third day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they recollected his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and turning away from the tomb they told all this to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James, and the rest of the women who were telling all this to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But the whole story seemed to them but an idle tale; and they disbelieved the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb, but when he stooped and looked in he saw the linen wrappings by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>On that same day two of his disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>They were talking together about all these events,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>and as they talked and discussed matter, Jesus himself drew near and began walking beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes continued to be held that they should not recognize him even for an instant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, "What words are these that you are exchanging one with another, as you walk along?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>They stood still, looking sad. And one of them named Cleopas,  answered him, "Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem, that you do not know what things have been happening there these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>"What kind of things?" he answered. And they said. "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>"and how our high priest and ruler delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>"But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yes,  and besides all this is the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>"Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They went to his tomb at daybreak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>"and found that his body was not there; then they came and told us that besides they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>"Thereupon some of our own party to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said, but him they did not see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>"O foolish men," said Jesus, "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>"Behooved it not the Christ to suffer thus, and then to enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning with Moses and the Prophets, he interpreted all the passages concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>When they drew near to the village to which they are were going, he appeared to be going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they urged him to stay with them, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>So he went in to stay with them. But as he sat down with them, and took bread, and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>"Were not our hearts burning within us," they said to each other,  "while we were talking with him on the way, and he was opening to us the scriptures?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose and returned to Jerusalem that very hour, and found the Eleven and the others all met together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, "The Lord is really risen, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>Then they began to tell what happened on the road, and he was known to them when he broke the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they were yet speaking he stood among them and said, "Peace be to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>They were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them. "Why are you disturbed? And why do questions rise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>"Look at my hands and my feet. It is I! Feel me and see; for a ghost has not flesh and blood as I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>Then he showed them his hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But while they still did not believe it for joy, and were filled with wonder, he asked them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, how all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms concerning me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and he said. "Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead, the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>"and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>"You must bear testimony to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>"And I will send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out until they were over against Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened that while he was blessing them, that he parted from them and was carried into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</verse>
