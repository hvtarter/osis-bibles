      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I am thankful to God, whom I serve from ancestors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my supplications night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>desiring greatly to see you, being mindful of your tears, that with joy I may be filled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>taking remembrance of the unfeigned <note>genuine, sincere</note> faith that is in you, that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause I remind you to stir up <note>kindle</note> the gift of God that is in you through the putting on of my hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>therefore you may not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do you suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard -- to that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>The pattern <note>example</note> hold you of sound words, which from me you did hear, in faith and love that is in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>the good thing committed guard you through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>you have known this, that they did turn from me -- all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister you do very well know.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>and the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, these things be committing <note>entrusting</note> to stedfast <note>reliable, faithful, trustworthy, dependable</note> men, who will be sufficient also others to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>you, therefore, suffer evil <note>hardship</note> as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that him who enlisted him he may please;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>the laboring husbandman <note>cultivator</note> it benefits first of the fruits to partake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what things I say, for the Lord will give to you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in which I suffer evil <note>hardship</note> -- unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God has not been bound;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that is in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>Stedfast <note>faithful</note>is the word: For if we died together -- we also shall live together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny him, he also shall deny us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we are not stedfast <note>faithful</note>, he remains stedfast <note>faithful</note>; to deny himself he is not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>These things remind them of, testifying fully before the Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>be diligent to present yourself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>sure, nevertheless, has the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord has known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>and the youthful lusts flee you, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>and a servant of the Lord it benefits not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>And this know you, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>for men <note>people</note> shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers <note>profane, those speaking insults</note>, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind <note>unsacred (Gk. anosios)</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection <note>affectionless</note>, implacable <note>unappeasable, irreconcilable, relentless</note>, false accusers <note>slanderers</note>, incontinent <note>without restraint, undisciplined, lacking self-control</note>, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, heady <note>rash, reckless</note>, lofty <note>conceited</note>, lovers of pleasure <note>hedonists</note> more <note>rather</note> than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form <note>semblance</note> of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden <note>weighed down, heaped, piled</note> with sins, led away with desires manifold <note>of various sorts</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>always learning, and <note>yet</note> never to a knowledge of truth able to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against <note>opposed</note> Moses, so also these do stand against <note>oppose</note> the truth, men <note>people</note> corrupted in mind, disapproved <note>rejected</note> concerning the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest <note>obvious, plain</note> to all, as theirs also did become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>And you -- you have followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering <note>patience, forbearance</note>, love, endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>and evil men <note>people</note> and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>And you -- be remaining in the things which you did learn and were entrusted <note>confident, convinced</note> with, having known from whom you did learn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>and because from a babe <note>infant</note> the Holy Writings you have known, which are able to make you wise -- to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright <note>correction</note>, for instruction that is in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man <note>person</note> of God may be fitted <note>equipped</note> -- for every good work having been completed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign --</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>And you -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of your ministration make full assurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release has arrived;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Be diligent to come unto me quickly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with yourself, for he is profitable to me for ministration <note>service</note>;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring you and the books -- especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil harm; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom also do you beware, for greatly has he stood against our words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save me -- to his heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>be diligent to come before winter. Salute you does Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit; the grace is with you! Amen.</verse>
