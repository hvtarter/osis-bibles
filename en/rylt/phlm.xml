      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I give thanks to my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love and faith that you have unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of your faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>for we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, having in Christ much boldness to command you that which is fit --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I entreat you concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was to you unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I did send again, and you him (that is, my own affections) receive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>and apart from your mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity your good deed may not be, but of willingness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly you may have him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If, then, with me you have fellowship, receive him as me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>and if he did hurt to you, or does owe anything, this to me be reckoning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also yourself, besides, to me you do owe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, may I have profit of you in the Lord; refresh my affections in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>having been confident in your obedience I did write to you, having known that also above what I may say you will do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Salute you does Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.</verse>
