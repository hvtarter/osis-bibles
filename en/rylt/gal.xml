  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I wonder that you are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- accursed let him be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what you did receive -- accursed let him be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught it, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>for you did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called me through His grace --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that are in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>and only they were hearing, that 'he who is persecuting us then, do now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>and they were glorifying God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>but not even Titus, who is with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and that because of the false brethren brought in unawares, who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, that us they might bring under bondage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that the truth of the good news might remain to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then, it makes no difference to me -- the face of man God accepts not, for -- to me those esteemed did add nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision may go,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent -- this very thing -- to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>and dissemble with him also did the other Jews, so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, 'If you, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations do live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations do you compel to Judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is then Christ a ministrant of sin? let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>for I through law, did die, that to God I may live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ does live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh -- in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and did give himself for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness be through law -- then Christ died in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth -- before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the Spirit did you receive, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>so thoughtless are you! having begun in the Spirit, now in the flesh do you end?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>so many things did you suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working mighty acts among you -- by works of law or by the hearing of faith is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>know you, then, that those of faith -- these are sons of Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God does declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>'Blessed in you shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed is every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law -- to do them,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because 'The righteous by faith shall live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>and the law is not by faith, but -- 'The man who did them shall live in them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, as a man I say it, even of man a confirmed covenant no one does make void or does add to,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, does not set aside, to make void the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>for if by law be the inheritance, it is no more by promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise has been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>the law, then, is against the promises of God? -- let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>for you are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all you are one in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>and if you are of Christ then of Abraham you are seed, and according to promise -- heirs.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differs nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>and because you are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>so that you are no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But then, indeed, not having known God, you were in servitude to those not by nature gods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>and now, having known God -- and rather being known by God -- how turn you again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew you desire to be in servitude?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>days you observe, and months, and times, and years!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Become as I am -- because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you; to me you did no hurt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>and you have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>and my trial that is in my flesh you did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God you did receive me -- as Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, you would have given to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>they are zealous for you -- yet not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them you may be zealous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>and it is good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who are willing to be under law, the law do you not hear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>for it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>but he who is of the maid-servant, according to flesh has been, and he who is of the free-woman, through the promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and does correspond to the Jerusalem that now is, and is in servitude with her children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>for it has been written, 'Rejoice, O barren, who are not bearing; break forth and cry, you who are not travailing, because many are the children of the desolate -- more than of her having the husband.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>but what saith the Writing? 'Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free -- stand you, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>lo, I Paul do say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>you were freed from the Christ, you who in law are declared righteous; from the grace you fell away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>the obedience is not of him who is calling you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>a little leaven the whole lump does leaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then has the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you -- to freedom you were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve you one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: 'You shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>and if one another you do bite and devour, see -- that you may not by one another be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>And I say: In the Spirit walk you, and the desire of the flesh you may not complete;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>for the flesh does desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that you may will -- these you may not do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>and if by the Spirit you are led, you are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking, one another envying!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself -- lest you also may be tempted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>of one another the burdens bear you, and so fill up the law of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>for if any one does think himself to be something -- being nothing -- himself he does deceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>for each one his own burden shall bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>You see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world has been crucified, and I to the world;</verse>
