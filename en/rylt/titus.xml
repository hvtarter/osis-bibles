      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>upon hope of life age-during, which God, who does not lie, did promise before times of ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause left I you in Crete, that the things lacking you may arrange, and may set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast <note>faithful</note>, not under accusation of riotous living <note>reckless lifestyle</note> or insubordinate --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>for it benefits the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward <note>administrator</note>, not self-pleased <note>arrogant, egocentric</note>, nor irascible <note>hot-tempered, prone to anger</note>, not given to wine, not a striker <note>brawler</note>, not given to filthy lucre <note>base gain</note>;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouth it benefits to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it benefits not, for filthy lucre's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- 'Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast <note>unfaithful</note>is nothing pure, but of them defiled are even the mind and the conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>And you -- be speaking what does become the sound teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>aged women, in like manner, in deportment <note>behavior</note> as does become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>sober, pure, keepers of their own houses <note>homemakers</note>, good, subject <note>submissive</note> to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>concerning all things yourself showing a pattern <note>an example</note> of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Servants -- to their own masters are to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not purloining <note>embezzling</note>, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise you!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold <note>many</note>, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>(not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>Stedfast is the word; and concerning these things I counsel you to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>having known that he has been subverted who is such, and does sin, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>Salute <note>greet</note> you do all those with me; salute <note>greet</note> those loving us in faith; the grace is with you all!</verse>
