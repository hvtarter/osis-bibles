      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>this one was in the beginning with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>all things through him did happen, and without him happened not even one thing that has happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness did not perceive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name is John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the Light, that all might believe through him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>that one was not the Light, but -- that he might testify about the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>He was the true Light, which does enlighten every man, coming to the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>in the world he was, and the world through him was made, and the world did not know him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>to his own things he came, and his own people did not receive him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh, nor of a will of man but -- of God were begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of an only begotten of a father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John does testify concerning him, and has cried, saying, 'This was he of whom I said, He who after me is coming, has come before me, for he was before me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>and out of his fulness did we all receive, and grace over-against grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>for the law through Moses was given, the grace and the truth through Jesus Christ did come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>God no one has ever seen; the only begotten Son, who is on the bosom of the Father -- he did declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might question him, 'Who are you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>and he confessed and did not deny, and confessed -- 'I am not the Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they questioned him, 'What then? Elijah are you?' and he said, 'I am not.' -- 'The prophet are you?' and he answered, 'No.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said then to him, 'Who are you, that we may give an answer to those sending us? what do you say concerning yourself?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, 'I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And those sent were of the Pharisees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>and they questioned him and said to him, 'Why, then, do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, 'I baptize with water, but in midst of you he has stood whom you have not known, this one it is who is coming after me, who has been before me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things came to pass in Bethabara, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>on the morrow John sees Jesus coming unto him, and said, 'Lo, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>this is he concerning whom I said, After me does come a man, who has come before me, because he was before me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>and I knew him not, but, that he might be manifested to Israel, because of this I came with the water baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying -- 'I have seen the Spirit coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whomsoever you mayest see the Spirit coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and having looked on Jesus walking, he said, 'Lo, the Lamb of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>and the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus having turned, and having beheld them following, said to them, 'What seek you?' and they said to them, 'Rabbi, (which is, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remain you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, 'Come and see;' they came, and saw where he does remain, and with him they remained that day and the hour was about the tenth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard from John, and followed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>this one does first find his own brother Simon, and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah,' (which is, being interpreted, The Anointed,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>and he brought him unto Jesus: and having looked upon him, Jesus said, 'You are Simon, the son of Jonas, you shall be called Cephas,' (which is interpreted, A rock.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow, he willed to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and said to him, 'Be following me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, 'Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>and Nathanael said to him, 'Out of Nazareth is any good thing able to be?' Philip said to him, 'Come and see.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and he said concerning him, 'Lo, truly an Israelite, in whom guile is not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, 'Whence me do you know?' Jesus answered and said to him, 'Before Philip's calling you -- you being under the fig-tree -- I saw you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the king of Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, 'Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree, you do believe; greater things than these you shall see;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>and he said to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, henceforth you shall see the heaven opened, and the messengers of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said unto him, 'Wine they have not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, 'What -- to me and to you, woman? not yet is mine hour come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the ministrants, 'Whatever he may say to you -- do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, 'Fill the water-jugs with water;' and they filled them -- unto the brim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>and he said to them, 'Draw out, now, and bear to the director of the apartment;' and they bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who have drawn the water,) the director of the feast does call the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, 'Every man, at first, the good wine does set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the inferior; you did keep the good wine till now.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and to those selling the doves he said, 'Take these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal of Your house did eat me up;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>the Jews then answered and said to him, 'What sign do you show to us -- that you do these things?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, 'Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews, therefore, said, 'Forty and six years was this sanctuary building, and will you in three days raise it up?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the Writing, and the word that Jesus said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus his name, a ruler of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>this one came unto him by night, and said to him, 'Rabbi, we have known that from God you have come -- a teacher, for no one these signs is able to do that you do, if God may not be with him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to see the reign of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said unto him, 'How is a man able to be born, being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter, and to be born?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the reign of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>that which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>'You may not wonder that I said to you, It behooves you to be born from above;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>the Spirit where he wills does blow, and his voice you do hear, but you have not known whence he comes, and whither he goes; thus is every one who has been born of the Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, 'How are these things able to happen?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, 'You art the teacher of Israel -- and these things you do not know!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>'Verily, verily, I say to you -- What we have known we speak, and what we have seen we testify, and our testimony you do not receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>if the earthly things I said to you, and you do not believe, how, if I shall say to you the heavenly things, will you believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>and no one has gone up to the heaven, except he who out of the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>'And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so it behooves the Son of Man to be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>'And this is the judgment, that the light has come to the world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>for every one who is doing wicked things hates the light, and does not come unto the light, that his works may not be detected;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>but he who is doing the truth does come to the light, that his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been wrought.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>and John was also baptizing in Aenon, near to Salem, because there were many waters there, and they were coming and were being baptized --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>for John was not yet cast into the prison --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>there arose then a question from the disciples of John with some Jews about purifying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>and they came unto John, and said to him, 'Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you did testify, lo, this one is baptizing, and all are coming unto him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, 'A man is not able to receive anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>you yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy does rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom; this, then, my joy has been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>'Him it behooves to increase, and me to become less;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from the earth, from the earth he is, and from the earth he speaks; he who from the heaven is coming is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>'And what he has seen and heard this he does testify, and his testimony none receives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>for he whom God sent, the sayings of God he speaks; for not by measure does God give the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>the Father does love the Son, and all things has given into his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>he who is believing in the Son, has life age-during; and he who is not believing the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God does remain upon him.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus more disciples does make and baptize than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and went away again to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>and it was behooving him to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>He comes, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well; it was as it were the sixth hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>there comes a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, 'Give me to drink;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may buy victuals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>the Samaritan woman therefore said to him, 'How do you, being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?' for Jews have no dealing with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you hadst known the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, 'Sir, you have not even a vessel to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, have you the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his cattle?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, 'Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him, may not thirst -- to the age; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life age-during.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said unto him, 'Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, 'Go, call your husband, and come hither;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>the woman answered and said, 'I have not a husband.' Jesus said to her, 'Well did you say -- A husband I have not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for five husbands you have had, and, now, he whom you have is not your husband; this have you said truly.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, 'Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>our fathers in this mountain did worship, and you -- you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it behooves to worship.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe me, that there does come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you worship the Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>you worship what you have not known; we worship what we have known, because the salvation is of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>but, there comes an hour, and it now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also does seek such to worship him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>Godis a Spirit, and those worshipping Him, in spirit and truth it does behoove to worship.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, 'I have known that Messiah does come, who is called Christ, when that one may come, he will tell us all things;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, 'I amhe, who am speaking to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples, and were wondering that with a woman he was speaking, no one, however, said, 'What seek you?' or 'Why speak you with her?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the city, and said to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>'Come, see a man, who told me all things -- as many as I did; is this the Christ?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went forth therefore out of the city, and were coming unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him, saying, 'Rabbi, eat;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>and he said to them, 'I have food to eat that you have not known.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples then said one to another, 'Did any one bring him anything to eat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, 'My food is, that I may do the will of Him who sent me, and may finish His work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>do not say that it is yet four months, and the harvest comes; lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and see the fields, that they are white unto harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>'And he who is reaping does receive a reward, and does gather fruit to life age-during, that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>for in this the saying is the true one, that one is the sower and another the reaper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that on which you have not laboured; others laboured, and you into their labour have entered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans, because of the word of the woman testifying, -- 'He told me all things -- as many as I did.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking him to remain with them, and he remained there two days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>and many more did believe because of his word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and said to the woman -- 'No more because of your speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast -- for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose son was ailing in Capernaum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus then said unto him, 'If signs and wonders you may not see, you will not believe.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The courtier said unto him, 'Sir, come down before my child die;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, 'Be going on; your son does live.' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>and he now going down, his servants met him, and told, saying -- 'Your child does live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him -- 'Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- 'Your son does live,' and he himself believed, and his whole house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of Judea to Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-gate a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool, and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever sickness he was held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is already a long time, he said to him, 'Do you wish to become whole?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The ailing man answered him, 'Sir, I have no man, that, when the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and while I am coming, another does go down before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, 'Rise, take up your couch, and be walking;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>the Jews then said to him that has been healed, 'It is a sabbath; it is not lawful to you to take up the couch.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, 'He who made me whole -- that one said to me, Take up your couch, and be walking;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>they questioned him, then, 'Who is the man who is saying to you, Take up your couch and be walking?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus did move away, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, 'Lo, you have become whole; sin no more, lest something worse may happen to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and seeking to kill him, because these things he was doing on a sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>And Jesus answered them, 'My Father till now does work, and I work;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore responded and said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner does;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>for the Father does love the Son, and does show to him all things that He himself does; and greater works than these He will show him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>'For, as the Father does raise the dead, and does make alive, so also the Son does make alive whom he wills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>for neither does the Father judge any one, but all the judgment He has given to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father; he who is not honouring the Son, does not honour the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>'Verily, verily, I say to you -- He who is hearing my word, and is believing Him who sent me, has life age-during, and to judgment he does not come, but has passed out of the death to the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>'Verily, verily, I say to you -- There comes an hour, and it now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those having heard shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>for, as the Father has life in himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>'Wonder not at this, because there does come an hour in which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to a rising again of life, and those who practised the evil things to a rising again of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>'I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee (of Tiberias),</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting with his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>and the passover was near, the feast of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus then having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a great multitude does come to him, said unto Philip, 'Whence shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?' --</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were filled, he said to his disciples, 'Gather together the broken pieces that are over, that nothing may be lost;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>and many of them said, 'He has a demon, and is mad, why do you hear him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>others said, 'These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, 'Till when our soul do you hold in suspense? if you are the Christ, tell us freely.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>but you do not believe, for you are not of my sheep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>my Father, who has given to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, 'Many good works did I show you from my Father; because of which work of them do you stone me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, saying, 'For a good work we do not stone you, but for evil speaking, and because you, being a man, do make yourself God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, 'Is it not having been written in your law: I said, you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do you say -- You speak evil, because I said, Son of God I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>and if I do, even if me you may not believe, the works believe, that you may know and may believe that in meis the Father, and I in Him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>and many came unto him, and said -- 'John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, 'Sir, lo, he whom you do love is ailing;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>and Jesus having heard, said, 'This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>then after this, he said to the disciples, 'We may go to Judea again;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>the disciples say to him, 'Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone you, and again you do go thither!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he does not stumble, because the light of this world he does see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he said, and after this he said to them, 'Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>therefore said his disciples, 'Sir, if he has fallen asleep, he will be saved;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, 'Lazarus has died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and I rejoice, for your sake, (that you may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, 'We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>And Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus does come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>but even now, I have known that whatever you may ask of God, God will give to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, 'Your brother shall rise again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, 'I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, 'I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>believe you this?' she said to him, 'Yes, sir, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, 'The Teacher is present, and does call you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>she, when she heard, rises up quickly, and does come to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- 'She does go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>'Where have you laid him?' they say to him, 'Sir, come and see;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews, therefore, said, 'Lo, how he was loving him!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>and certain of them said, 'Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, comes to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, 'Take you away the stone;' the sister of him who has died -- Martha -- said to him, 'Sir, already he stinks, for he is four days dead;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, 'Said I not to you, that if you may believe, you shall see the glory of God?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, 'Father, I thank You, that You did hear me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>and I knew that You always do hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I saidit, that they may believe that You did send me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, 'Lazarus, come forth;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus said to them, 'Loose him, and suffer to go.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrin, and said, 'What may we do? because this man does many signs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, 'You have not known anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, 'What does appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may show it, so that they may seize him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus, who had died, whom he raised out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>they made, therefore, to him a supper there, and Martha was ministering, and Lazarus was one of those reclining together (at meat) with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary, therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of spikenard, of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus and did wipe with her hair his feet, and the house was filled from the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Therefore said one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot, of Simon, who is about to deliver him up --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>'Therefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries, and given to the poor?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>and he said this, not because he was caring for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and what things were put in he was carrying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus, therefore, said, 'Suffer her; for the day of my embalming she has kept it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>for the poor you have always with yourselves, and me you have not always.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great multitude, therefore, of the Jews knew that he is there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that Lazarus also they may see, whom he raised out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>and the chief priests took counsel, that also Lazarus they may kill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away, and were believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow, a great multitude that came to the feast, having heard that Jesus does come to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palms, and went forth to meet him, and were crying, 'Hosanna, blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it, according as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>'Fear not, daughter of Sion, lo, your king does come, sitting on an ass' colt.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>And these things his disciples did not know at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were having been written about him, and these things they did to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude, therefore, who are with him, were testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and did raise him out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>because of this also did the multitude meet him, because they heard of his having done this sign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, 'You see that you do not gain anything, lo, the world did go after him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that they may worship in the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these then came near to Philip, who is from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were asking him, saying, 'Sir, we wish to see Jesus;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus responded to them, saying, 'The hour has come that the Son of Man may be glorified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>verily, verily, I say to you, if the grain of the wheat, having fallen to the earth, may not die, itself remains alone; and if it may die, it does bear much fruit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>he who is loving his life shall lose it, and he who is hating his life in this world -- to life age-during shall keep it;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Your name.' There came, therefore, a voice out of the heaven, 'I both glorified, and again I will glorify it;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>the multitude, therefore, having stood and heard, were saying that there has been thunder; others said, 'A messenger has spoken to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, 'Not because of me has this voice come, but because of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>now is a judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>and I, if I may be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>And this he said signifying by what death he was about to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>the multitude answered him, 'We heard out of the law that the Christ does remain -- to the age; and how do you say, That it behooves the Son of Man to be lifted up? who is this -- the Son of Man?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time is the light with you; walk while you have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness has not known where he goes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>while you have the light, believe in the light, that sons of light you may become.' These things spake Jesus, and having gone away, he was hid from them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>yet he having done so many signs before them, they were not believing in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said, 'Lord, who gave credence to our report? and the arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Because of this they were not able to believe, that again Isaiah said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>'He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I might heal them;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>these things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Still, however, also out of the rulers did many believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing, that they might not be put out of the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried and said, 'He who is believing in me, does not believe in me, but in Him who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and he who is beholding me, does behold Him who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I a light to the world have come, that every one who is believing in me -- in the darkness may not remain;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>because I spake not from myself, but the Father who sent me, He did give me a command, what I may say, and what I may speak,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>And following Jesus was Simon Peter, and the other disciple, and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>and Peter was standing at the door without, therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and he spake to the female keeping the door, and he brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter, 'Art you also of the disciples of this man?' he said, 'I am not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>and the servants and the officers were standing, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The chief priests, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, 'I spake freely to the world, I did always teach in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews do always come together; and in secret I spake nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>why me do you question? question those having heard what I spake to them; lo, these have known what I said.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And he having said these things, one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap, saying, 'Thus do you answer the chief priest?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, 'If I spake ill, testify concerning the ill; and if well, why me do you smite?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said then to him, 'Are you also of his disciples?' he denied, and said, 'I am not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, 'Did not I see you in the garden with him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>again, therefore, Peter denied, and immediately a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the passover;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>they answered and said to him, 'If he were not an evil doer, we had not delivered him to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate, therefore, said to them, 'Take you him -- you -- and according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to him, 'It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, 'You are the King of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, 'From yourself do you say this? or did others say it to you about me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew? your nation, and the chief priests did deliver you up to me; what did you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'Art you then a king?' Jesus answered, 'You do sayit; because a king I am, I for this have been born, and for this I have come to the world, that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth, does hear my voice.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and said to them, 'I do find no fault in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>and you have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will you, therefore, that I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>therefore they all cried out again, saying, 'Not this one -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then, therefore, did Pilate take Jesus and scourge him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, did place it on his head, and a purple garment they put around him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, 'Hail! the king of the Jews;' and they were giving him slaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate, therefore, again went forth without, and said to them, 'Lo, I do bring him to you without, that you may know that in him I find no fault;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus, therefore, came forth without, bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment; and he said to them, 'Lo, the man!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When, therefore, the chief priests and the officers did see him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify;' Pilate said to them, 'Take you him -- you, and crucify; for I find no fault in him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>the Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, for he made himself Son of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and entered again to the praetorium, and said to Jesus, 'Whence are you?' and Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'To me do you not speak? Have you not known that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, 'You wouldst have no authority against me, if it were not having been given you from above; because of this, he who is delivering me up to you has greater sin.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this time was Pilate seeking to release him, and the Jews were crying out, saying, 'If this one you may release, you are not a friend of Caesar; every one making himself a king, does speak against Caesar.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called, 'Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he said to the Jews, 'Lo, your king!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>and they cried out, 'Take away, take away, crucify him;' Pilate said to them, 'Your king shall I crucify?' the chief priests answered, 'We have no king except Caesar.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross, and it was written, 'Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was near to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate, 'Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven throughout,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>they said, therefore, to one another, 'We may not rend it, but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing might be fulfilled, that is saying, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus, therefore, having seen his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he was loving, he said to his mother, 'Woman, lo, your son;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>afterward he said to the disciple, 'Lo, your mother;' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, said, 'I thirst;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop stalk, did put it to his mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, 'It has been finished;' and having bowed the head, gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and they taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>and he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true, and that one has known that true things he speaks, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, 'A bone of him shall not be broken;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>and again another Writing said, 'They shall look to him whom they did pierce.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were, a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene does come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she sees the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>she runs, therefore, and comes unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and said to them, 'They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not known where they laid him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and they were coming to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>and the two were running together, and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and having stooped down, sees the linen clothes lying, yet, indeed, he entered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter, therefore, comes, following him, and he entered into the tomb, and beholds the linen clothes lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but apart, having been folded up, in one place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>for not yet did they know the Writing, that it behooves him out of the dead to rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>and Mary was standing near the tomb, weeping without; as she was weeping, then, she stooped down to the tomb, and beholds two messengers in white, sitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, 'Woman, why do you weep?' she said to them, 'Because they took away my Lord, and I have not known where they laid him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>and these things having said, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing, and she had not known that it is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why do you weep? whom do you seek;' she, supposing that he is the gardener, said to him, 'Sir, if you did carry him away, tell me where you did lay him, and I will take him away;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, 'Mary!' having turned, she said to him, 'Rabbouni;' that is to say, 'Teacher.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, 'Be not touching me, for I have not yet ascended unto my Father; and be going on to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and to your God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary the Magdalene comes, telling to the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that these things he said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, 'Peace to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>and this having said, he showed them his hands and side; the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus, therefore, said to them again, 'Peace to you; according as the Father has sent me, I also send you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>and this having said, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>if of any you may loose the sins, they are loosed to them; if of any you may retain, they have been retained.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>the other disciples, therefore, said to him, 'We have seen the Lord;' and he said to them, 'If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them; Jesus comes, the doors having been shut, and he stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace to you!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>then he said to Thomas, 'Bring your finger hither, and see my hands, and bring your hand, and putit to my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, 'Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed; happy those not having seen, and having believed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before his disciples, that are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>and these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the disciples on the sea of Tiberias, and he did manifest himself thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, 'I go away to fish;' they say to him, 'We go -- we also -- with you;' they went forth and entered into the boat immediately, and on that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>And morning being now come, Jesus stood at the shore, yet indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Lads, have you any meat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>they answered him, 'No;' and he said to them, 'Cast the net at the right side of the boat, and you shall find;' they cast, therefore, and no longer were they able to draw it, from the multitude of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus was loving said to Peter, 'The Lord it is!' Simon Peter, therefore, having heard that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, 'Bring you from the fishes that you caught now;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net up on the land, full of great fishes, an hundred fifty and three, and though they were so many, the net was not rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, 'Come you, dine;' and none of the disciples was venturing to inquire of him, 'Who are you?' knowing that it is the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus, therefore, does come and take the bread and give to them, and the fish in like manner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>this is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When, therefore, they dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?' he said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you have known that I dearly love you;' he said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again, a second time, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you love me?' he said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you have known that I dearly love you;' he said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you dearly love me?' Peter was grieved that he said to him the third time, 'Do you dearly love me?' and he said to him, 'Lord, you have known all things; you do know that I dearly love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>verily, verily, I say to you, When you were younger, you were girding yourself and were walking whither you did will, but when you may be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another will gird you, and shall carryyou whither you do not will;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>and this he said, signifying by what death he shall glorify God; and having said this, he said to him, 'Be following me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>And Peter having turned about does see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on his breast, and said, 'Sir, who is he who is delivering you up?')</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter having seen this one, said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what of this one?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you? be you following me.' This word, therefore, went forth to the brethren that that disciple does not die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written. Amen.</verse>
