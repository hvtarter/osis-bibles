      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>All joy count it, my brethren, when you may fall into temptations manifold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>knowing that the proof of your faith does work endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>and let the endurance have a perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall be given to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is doubting has been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>a two-souled man is unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of grass he shall pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade away!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Happy the man who does endure temptation, because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the Lord did promise to those loving Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one say, being tempted -- 'From God I am tempted,' for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself does tempt no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away and enticed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>afterward the desire having conceived, does give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected, does bring forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God does not work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word, that is able to save your souls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>and become you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one has been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>for he did view himself, and has gone away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any one does think to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain is the religion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, 'You -- sit you here well,' and to the poor man may say, 'You -- stand you there, or, Sit you here under my footstool,' --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>you did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>and you did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If, indeed, royal law you complete, according to the Writing, 'You shall love thy neighbour as thyself,' -- you do well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>and if you accept persons, sin you do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one point, he has become guilty of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>for He who is saying, 'You may not commit adultery,' said also, 'You may do no murder;' and if you shall not commit adultery, and shall commit murder, you have become a transgressor of law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>so speak you and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>for the judgment without kindness is to him not having done kindness, and exult does kindness over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What is the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able to save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and any one of you may say to them, 'Depart you in peace, be warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what is the profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But say may some one, You have faith, and I have works, show me thy faith out of thy works, and I will show you out of my works my faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>you -- you do believe that God is one; you do well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>And do you wish to know, O vain man, that the faith apart from the works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>do you see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;' and, 'Friend of God' he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Many teachers become not, my brethren, having known that greater judgment we shall receive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word does not stumble, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman does counsel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>so also the tongue is a little member, and does boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it does kindle!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>and the tongue is a fire, the world of the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by the gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and has been subdued, by the human nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>out of the same mouth does come forth blessing and cursing; it does not need, my brethren, these things so to happen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>does the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water is able to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and intelligent among you? let him show out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>and if bitter zeal you have, and rivalry in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>for where zeal and rivalry are, there is insurrection and every evil matter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>Whence are wars and fightings among you? not thence -- out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>you desire, and you have not; you murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; you fight and war, and you have not, because of your not asking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>you ask, and you receive not, because evilly you ask, that in your pleasures you may spend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulterers and adulteresses! have you not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do you think that emptily the Writing says, 'To envy earnestly desires the spirit that did dwell in us,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>and greater grace he does give, wherefore he says, 'God against proud ones does set Himself up, and to lowly ones He does give grace?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>draw near to God, and He will draw near to you; cleanse hands, you sinners! and purify hearts, you two-souled!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, does speak against law, and does judge law, and if law you do judge, you are not a doer of law but a judge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; you -- who are you that do judge the other?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Go, now, you who are saying, 'To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>instead of your saying, 'If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>and now you glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Go, now, you rich! weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. You made treasure in the last days!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who in-gathered your fields, which has been fraudulently kept back by you -- does cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>you did live in luxury upon the earth, and were wanton; you did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>you did condemn -- you did murder the righteous one, he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient, then, brethren, till the presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman does expect the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain -- early and latter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>be patient, you also; establish your hearts, because the presence of the Lord has drawn near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>murmur not against one another, brethren, that you may not be condemned; lo, the Judge before the door has stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>An example take you of the suffering of evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>lo, we call happy those who are enduring; the endurance of Job you heard of, and the end of the Lord you have seen, that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>And before all things, my brethren, do not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment you may not fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Does any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may have committed, they shall be forgiven to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that you may be healed; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man like affected as we, and with prayer he did pray -- not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>and again he did pray, and the heaven did give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brethren, if any among you may go astray from the truth, and any one may turn him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
