  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place -- both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in every thing you were enriched in him, in all discourse and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not behind in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblameable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>faithful is God, through whom you were called to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the same thing you may all say, and there may not be divisions among you, and you may be perfected in the same mind, and in the same judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe, that contentions are among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>and I say this, that each one of you says, 'I, indeed, am of Paul' -- 'and I of Apollos,' -- 'and I of Cephas,' -- 'and I of Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you? or to the name of Paul were you baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize, except Crispus and Gaius --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>and I did baptize also Stephanas' household -- further, I have not known if I did baptize any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but -- to proclaim good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness, and to us -- those being saved -- it is the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>for it has been written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nothing;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>where is the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God, it did please God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>also we -- we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>for see your calling, brethren, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the base things of the world, and the things despised did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things that are He may make useless --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh may glory before Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>and of Him you -- you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, according as it has been written, 'He who is glorying -- in the Lord let him glory.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, having come unto you, brethren, came -- not in superiority of discourse or wisdom -- declaring to you the testimony of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming useless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but, according as it has been written, 'What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him --'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>but to us did God reveal them through His Spirit, for the Spirit all things does search, even the depths of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>for who of men have known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? so also the things of God no one has known, except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that is of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>and the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know them, because spiritually they are discerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>and he who is spiritual, does discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for you were not yet able, but not even yet are you now able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for yet you are fleshly, for where there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>for when one may say, 'I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, 'I -- of Apollos;' are you not fleshly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom you did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another does build on it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>and if any one does build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare it, because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>if of any one the work does remain that he built on it, a wage he shall receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>have you not known that you are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God does dwell in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>if any one the sanctuary of God does waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself; if any one does seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it has been written, 'Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, 'The Lord does know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>and as to the rest, it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged, or by man's day, but not even myself do I judge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>for of nothing to myself have I been conscious, but not in this have I been declared right -- and he who is discerning me is the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>so, then, nothing before the time judge you, till the Lord may come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise shall come to each from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>And these things, brethren, I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you, that in us you may learn not to think above that which has been written, that you may not be puffed up one for one against the other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>for who does make you to differ? and what have you, that you did not receive? and if you did also receive, why do you glory as not having received?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are having been filled, already you were rich, apart from us you did reign, and I would also you did reign, that we also with you may reign together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death, because a spectacle we became to the world, and messengers, and men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>we are fools because of Christ, and you wise in Christ; we are ailing, and you strong; you glorious, and we dishonoured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>unto the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being spoken evil of, we entreat; as filth of the world we did become -- of all things an offscouring -- till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not as putting you to shame do I write these things, but as my beloved children I do admonish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>for if a myriad of child-conductors you may have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the good news, I -- I did beget you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I call upon you, therefore, become you followers of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>because of this I sent to you Timotheus, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, according as everywhere in every assembly I teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>but I will come quickly unto you, if the Lord may will, and I will know not the word of those puffed up, but the power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>for not in word is the reign of God, but in power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>what do you wish? with a rod shall I come unto you, or in love, with a spirit also of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations -- as that one has the wife of the father! --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>and you are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- you being gathered together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Not good is your glorying; have you not known that a little leaven the whole lump does leaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing you ought then to go forth out of the world --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>and now, I did write to you not to keep company with him, if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>for what have I also those without to judge? those within do you not judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>and those without God does judge; and put you away the evil from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>have you not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the smaller judgments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>have you not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>of the things of life, indeed, then, if you may have judgment, those despised in the assembly -- these cause you to sit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother with brother does go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that you have judgments with one another; wherefore do you not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be you not rather defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>but you -- you do injustice, and you defraud, and these -- brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>have you not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And certain of you were these! but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were declared righteous, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I -- I will not be under authority by any;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>the meats are for the belly, and the belly for the meats. And God both this and these shall make useless; and the body is not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up through His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Have you not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make them members of an harlot? let it be not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>have you not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? 'for they shall be -- says He -- the two for one flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>flee the whoredom; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body, and he who is committing whoredom, against his own body does sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Have you not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God? and you are not your own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>And concerning the things of which you wrote to me: good it is for a man not to touch a woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her proper husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render, and in like manner also the wife to the husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>the wife over her own body has not authority, but the husband; and, in like manner also, the husband over his own body has not authority, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>for I wish all men to be even as I myself am; but each his own gift has of God, one indeed thus, and one thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I am;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>and if they have not continence -- let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>and to the married I announce -- not I, but the Lord -- let not a wife separate from a husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>but and if she may separate, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled, and let not a husband send away a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother has a wife unbelieving, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not send her away;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>and if all were one member, where the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>and now, indeed, are many members, and one body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>and an eye is not able to say to the hand, 'I have no need of you;' nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love does not envy, the love does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>does not act unseemly, does not seek its own things, is not provoked, does not impute evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>rejoices not over the unrighteousness, and rejoices with the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>all things it bears, all it believes, all it hopes, all it endures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>The love does never fail; and whether there be prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>for in part we know, and in part we prophecy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>and when that which is perfect may come, then that which is in part shall become useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>and now there does remain faith, hope, love -- these three; and the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue the love, and seek earnestly the spiritual things, and rather that you may prophecy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>for he who is speaking in an unknown tongue -- to men he does not speak, but to God, for no one does hearken, and in spirit he does speak secrets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>and he who is prophesying to men does speak edification, and exhortation, and comfort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>he who is speaking in an unknown tongue, himself does edify, and he who is prophesying, an assembly does edify;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>and I wish you all to speak with tongues, and more that you may prophecy, for greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with tongues, except one may interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>And now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>yet the things without life giving sound -- whether pipe or harp -- if a difference in the sounds they may not give, how shall be known that which is piped or that which is harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give, who shall prepare himself for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>so also you, if through the tongue, speech easily understood you may not give -- how shall that which is spoken be known? for you shall be speaking to air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is unmeaning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>if, then, I do not know the power of the voice, I shall be to him who is speaking a foreigner, and he who is speaking, is to me a foreigner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>so also you, since you are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, for the building up of the assembly seek that you may abound;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>wherefore he who is speaking in an unknown tongue -- let him pray that he may interpret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>for if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit does pray, and my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing psalms with the spirit, and I will sing psalms also with the understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>since, if you may bless with the spirit, he who is filling the place of the unlearned, how shall he say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, since what you do say he has not known?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>for you, indeed, do give thanks well, but the other is not built up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues speaking --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than myriads of words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in the evil be you babes, and in the understanding become you perfect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>in the law it has been written, that, 'With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear Me, says the Lord;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>so that the tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving; and the prophesy is not for the unbelieving, but for the believing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If, therefore, the whole assembly may come together, to the same place, and all may speak with tongues, and there may come in unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>and if all may prophecy, and any one may come in, an unbeliever or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>and so the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so having fallen upon his face, he will bow before God, declaring that God really is among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What then is it, brethren? whenever you may come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation? let all things be for building up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>if an unknown tongue any one do speak, by two, or at the most, by three, and in turn, and let one interpret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>and if there may be no interpreter, let him be silent in an assembly, and to himself let him speak, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And prophets -- let two or three speak, and let the others discern,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>and if to another sitting anything may be revealed, let the first be silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>for you are able, one by one, all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>for God is not a God of tumult, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Your women in the assemblies let them be silent, for it has not been permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law says;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>and if they wish to learn anything, at home their own husbands let them question, for it is a shame to women to speak in an assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone did it come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>if any one does think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things that I write to you -- that of the Lord they are commands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>so that, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and to speak with tongues do not forbid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that I proclaimed to you, which also you did receive, in which also you have stood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>through which also you are being saved, in what words I proclaimed good news to you, if you hold fast, except you did believe in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>for I delivered to you first, what also I did receive, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried, and that he has risen on the third day, according to the Writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till now, and certain also did fall asleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>afterwards he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all -- as to the untimely birth -- he appeared also to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>for I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I did persecute the assembly of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>and by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace that is towards me came not in vain, but more abundantly than they all did I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>whether, then, I or they, so we preach, and so you did believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>And if Christ is preached, that out of the dead he has risen, how say certain among you, that there is no rising again of dead persons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>and if there be no rising again of dead persons, neither has Christ risen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>and if Christ has not risen, then void is our preaching, and void also your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>and we also are found false witnesses of God, because we did testify of God that He raised up the Christ, whom He did not raise if then dead persons do not rise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>for if dead persons do not rise, neither has Christ risen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>and if Christ has not risen, vain is your faith, you are yet in your sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>then, also, those having fallen asleep in Christ did perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>if in this life we have hope in Christ only, of all men we are most to be pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>And now, Christ has risen out of the dead -- the first-fruits of those sleeping he became,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>for since through man is the death, also through man is a rising again of the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>for even as in Adam all die, so also in the Christ all shall be made alive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>and each in his proper order, a first-fruit Christ, afterwards those who are the Christ's, in his presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>then -- the end, when he may deliver up the reign to God, even the Father, when he may have made useless all rule, and all authority and power --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>for it behooves him to reign till he may have put all the enemies under his feet --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>the last enemy is done away -- death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>for all things He did put under his feet, and, when one may say that all things have been subjected, it is evident that He is excepted who did subject the all things to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>and when the all things may be subjected to him, then the Son also himself shall be subject to Him, who did subject to him the all things, that God may be the all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Seeing what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? why also are they baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>why also do we stand in peril every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>Every day do I die, by the glorying of you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in Ephesus, what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Be not led astray; evil communications corrupt good manners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>awake up, as is right, and sin not; for certain have an ignorance of God; for shame to you I say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will say, 'How do the dead rise?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>unwise! you -- what you do sow is not quickened except it may die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>and that which you do sow, not the body that shall be do you sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>and God does give to it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its proper body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>and there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the earthly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star does differ in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the rising again of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>so also it has been written, 'The first man Adam became a living creature,' the last Adam is for a life-giving spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>but that which is spiritual is not first, but that which was natural, afterwards that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord out of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>as is the earthy, such are also the earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are also the heavenly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>and, according as we did bear the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit, nor does the corruption inherit the incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>lo, I tell you a secret; we indeed shall not all sleep, and we all shall be changed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet, for it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we -- we shall be changed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>for it behooves this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption, and this mortal may have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that has been written, 'The Death was swallowed up -- to victory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>where, O Death, thy sting? where, O Hades, thy victory?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>and the sting of the death is the sin, and the power of the sin the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>and to God -- thanks, to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>so that, my brethren beloved, become you stedfast, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord.</verse>
