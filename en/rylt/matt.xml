      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah fathered Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon, of her who had been Uriah's,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor fathered Sadok, and Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is named Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive Mary your wife, for that which in her was conceived is of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us he is God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire you exactly for the child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord does appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be you there till I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very enraged, and having sent forth, he murdered all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream does appear to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>and having heard that Archelaus does reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days comes John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, 'Reform, for come near has the reign of the heavens,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by you to be baptized -- and you do come unto me!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answering said to him, 'Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he does permit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son you are of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, 'It has been written, Not upon bread alone does man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then does the Devil take him to the holy city, and does set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, 'If Son you are of God -- cast yourself down, for it has been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash on a stone your foot.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him again, 'It has been written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again does the Devil take him to a very high mount, and does show to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, 'All these to you I will give, if falling down you may bow to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then said Jesus to him, 'Go -- Adversary, for it has been written, The Lord your God you shall bow to, and Him only you shall serve.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then does the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, 'Reform you, for come near has the reign of the heavens.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he said to them, 'Come you after me, and I will make you fishers of men,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having advanced from there, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>'Blessed the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>'Blessed the mourning -- because they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>'Blessed the meek -- because they shall inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>'Blessed those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>'Blessed the kind -- because they shall find kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>'Blessed the clean in heart -- because they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>'Blessed the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>'Blessed those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>'Blessed are you whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>rejoice you and be glad, because your rewardis great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>'You are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose savour, in what shall it be salted? For nothing is it good henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>'You are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shines to all those in the house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father whois in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>'Do not suppose that I came to throw out<note>abolish, annul, demolish, destroy, disunite, put down, take apart, weaken</note> the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw out <note>abolish, annul, demolish, destroy, disunite, put down, take apart, weaken</note>, but to fulfill <note>bring to fulness, complete, fill up, make full</note>;}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota<note>smallest Hebrew letter</note> or one tittle <note>point on a letter, serif</note> may not pass away from the law, till that all may come to pass.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>'Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach, he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>'For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, you may not enter to the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>'You heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! Shall be in danger of the sanhedrin, and whoever may say, Rebel! Shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>'If, therefore, you may bring your gift to the altar, and there may remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there your gift before the altar, and go -- first be reconciled to your brother, and then having come bring your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>'Be agreeing with your opponent quickly, while you are in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver you to the judge, and the judge may deliver you to the officer, and to prison you may be cast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>verily I say to you, you may not come forth from there till that you may pay the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>'You heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not commit adultery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>'But, if your right eye does cause you to stumble, pluck it out and cast from you, for it is good to you that one of your members may perish, and not your whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>'And, if your right hand does cause you to stumble, cut it off, and cast from you, for it is good to you that one of your members may perish, and not your whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>'And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, except for the matter of whoredom, does make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who has been put away does commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>'Again, you heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but you shall pay to the Lord your oaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>nor by your head may you swear, because you are not able one hair to make white or black;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is more than these is of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>'You heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and whoever is willing to take you to law, and your coat to take -- permit to him also the cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>'And whoever shall impress you one mile, go with him two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>to him who is asking of you be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from you may not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>'You heard that it was said: You shall love your neighbor, and shall hate your enemy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He does cause to rise on evil and good, and He does send rain on righteous and unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>'For, if you may love those loving you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you may salute your brethren only, what do you abundant? Do not also the tax-gatherers so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>You shall therefore be perfect, as your Father whois in the heavens is perfect.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>'Take heed your kindness not to do before men, to be seen by them, and if not -- reward you have not from your Father whois in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>whenever, therefore, you may do kindness, you may not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you -- they have their reward!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>'But you, doing kindness, let not your left hand know what your right hand does,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that your kindness may be in secret, and your Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>'And when you may pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, because they love in the synagogues, and in the corners of the broad places -- standing -- to pray, that they may be seen of men; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>'But you, when you may pray, go into your chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father whois in secret, and your Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>'And -- praying -- you may not use vain repetitions like the nations, for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>be you not therefore like to them, for your Father does know those things that you have need of before your asking him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>thus therefore pray you: 'Our Father, whois in the heavens, hallowed be Your name!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>'Your reign come: Your will come to pass, as in heaven also on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>'Our appointed bread give us to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>'And forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>'And may You not lead us to temptation, but deliver us from the evil, because Yours is the reign, and the power, and the glory -- to the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>'For, if you may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you -- your Father whois in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>but if you may not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>'And when you may fast, be you not as the hypocrites, of sour countenances, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men fasting; verily I say to you, that they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>'But you, fasting, anoint your head, and wash your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>that you may not appear to men fasting, but to your Father whois in secret, and your Father, who is seeing in secret, shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>'Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust disfigure, and where thieves break through and steal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does disfigure, and where thieves do not break through nor steal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>for where your treasure is, there will be also your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>'The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, your eye may be perfect, all your body shall be enlightened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>but if your eye may be evil, all your body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light thatis in you is darkness -- the darkness, how great!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>'None is able to serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one, and despise the other; you are not able to serve God and Mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>'Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what you may eat, and what you may drink, nor for your body, what you may put on. Is not the life more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father does nourish them; are not you much better than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>'And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age one cubit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And about clothing why are you anxious? Consider well the lilies of the field; how do they grow? They do not labour, nor do they spin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>'And if the herb of the field, that to-day is, and to-morrow is cast to the furnace, God does so clothe -- not much more you, O you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore you may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? Or, What may we drink? Or, What may we put round?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For all these do the nations seek for, for your heavenly Father does know that you have need of all these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>but seek you first the reign of God and His righteousness, and all these shall be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the dayis the evil of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>'Judge not, that you may not be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>for in what judgment you judge, you shall be judged, and in what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>'And why do you behold the mote<note>splinter, speck</note> that is in your brother's eye, and the beam that is in your own eye do not consider?}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or, how will you say to your brother, Permit I may cast out the mote<note>splinter, speck</note> from your eye, and lo, the beam is in your own eye?}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to cast out the mote<note>splinter, speck</note> out of your brother's eye.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>'You may not give that which isholy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, that they may not trample them among their feet, and having turned -- may rend you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>'Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>for every one who is asking does receive, and he who is seeking does find, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>'Or what man is of you, of whom, if his son may ask a loaf -- a stone will he present to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>And if a fish he may ask -- a serpent will he present to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If, therefore, you being evil, have known good gifts to give to your children, how much more shall your Father whois in the heavens give good things to those asking him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>'All things, therefore, whatever you may will that men may be doing to you, so also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>'Go you in through the strait<note>cramped, constricted</note> gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it;}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>how strait<note>cramped, constricted</note>is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to the life, and few are those finding it!}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>'But, take heed of the false prophets, who come unto you in sheep's clothing, and inwardly are ravening wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>From their fruits you shall know them; domen gather from thorns grapes? Or from thistles figs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>So every good tree does yield good fruits, but the bad tree does yield evil fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits, nor a bad tree to yield good fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>therefore from their fruits you shall know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>'Not every one who is saying to me Lord, lord, shall come into the reign of the heavens; but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, lord, have we not in your name prophesied? And in your name cast out demons? And in your name done many mighty things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then I will acknowledge to them, that -- I never knew you, depart from me you who are working lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>'Therefore, every one who does hear of me these words, and does do them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>'And every one who is hearing of me these words, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>And when he came down from the mount, great multitudes did follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>and lo, a leper having come, was bowing to him, saying, 'Sir, if you are willing, you are able to cleanse me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>and having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 'I will, be you cleansed,' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, 'See, you may tell no one, but go, yourself show to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, 'Sir, my young man has been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>and Jesus said to him, 'I, having come, will heal him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>And the centurion answering said, 'Sir, I am not worthy that you may enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Be coming, and he comes, and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those following, 'Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the reign of the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go, and as you did believe let it be to you;' and his young man was healed in that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid, and fevered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose, and was ministering to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And evening having come, they brought to him many demoniacs, and he did cast out the spirits with a word, and did heal all who were ill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'Himself took our infirmities, and the sicknesses he did bear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did command to depart to the other side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>and a certain scribe having come, said to him, 'Teacher, I will follow you wherever you may go;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>and Jesus said to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man has not where he may lay the head.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>And another of his disciples said to him, 'Sir, permit me first to depart and to bury my father;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>and Jesus said to him, 'Follow me, and permit the dead to bury their own dead.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>and his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying, 'Sir, save us; we are perishing.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And he said to them, 'Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?' Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>and the men wondered, saying, 'What kind -- is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And he having come to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over by that way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>and lo, they cried out, saying, 'What -- to us and to you, Jesus, Son of God? Did you come here, before the time, to afflict us?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>and the demons were calling on him, saying, 'If you do cast us forth, permit us to go away to the herd of the swine;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>and he said to them, 'Go.' And having come forth, they went to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep, to the sea, and died in the waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city, they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having seen him, they called on him that he might depart from their borders.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And having gone to the boat, he passed over, and came to his own city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>and lo, they were bringing to him a paralytic, laid upon a couch, and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, 'Be of good courage, child, your sins have been forgiven you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And lo, certain of the scribes said within themselves, 'This one does speak evil.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, 'Why think you evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier? To say, The sins have been forgiven to you; or to say, Rise, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>'But, that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins -- (then said he to the paralytic) -- having risen, take up your couch, and go to your house.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And he, having risen, went to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God, who did give such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And Jesus passing by from there, saw a man sitting at the tax-office, named Matthew, and said to him, 'Be following me,' and he, having risen, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house, that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were lying (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples, 'Why with the tax-gatherers and sinners does your teacher eat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>And Jesus having heard, said to them, 'They who are whole have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>but having gone, learn you what is, Kindness I will, and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners, to reformation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then come to him do the disciples of John, saying, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, and your disciples fast not?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? But days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>'And no one does put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment, for its filling up does take from the garment, and a worse rent is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>'Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not -- the skins burst, and the wine does run out, and the skins are destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler having come, was bowing to him, saying that 'My daughter just now died, but, having come, lay your hand upon her, and she shall live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus having risen, did follow him, also his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, having come to him behind, did touch the fringe of his garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said within herself, 'If only I may touch his garment, I shall be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>And Jesus having turned about, and having seen her, said, 'Be of good courage, daughter, your faith has saved you,' and the woman was saved from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler, and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said to them, 'Withdraw, for the damsel did not die, but does sleep,' and they were deriding him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>but, when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>and the fame of this went forth to all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And Jesus passing on from there, two blind men followed him, calling and saying, 'Deal kindly with us, Son of David.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, 'Believe you that I am able to do this?' They say to him, 'Yes, sir.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then touched he their eyes, saying, 'According to your faith let it be to you,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, 'See, let no one know;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, a demoniac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spoke, and the multitude did wonder, saying that 'It was never so seen in Israel:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>but the Pharisees said, 'By the ruler of the demons he does cast out the demons.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>And having seen the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, that they were faint and cast aside, as sheep not having a shepherd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>then said he to his disciples, 'The harvest indeedis abundant, but the workmen few;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>beseech you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he may put forth workmen to His harvest.'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave to them power over unclean spirits, so as to be casting them out, and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>And of the twelve apostles the names are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.3'>Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.4'>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.5'>These twelve did Jesus send forth, having given command to them, saying, 'To the way of the nations go not away, and into a city of the Samaritans go not in,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, 'Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living, After three days I do rise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>And Pilate said to them, 'You have a watch, go away, make secure -- as you have known;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure, having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the messenger answering said to the women, 'Fear not you, for I have known that Jesus, who has been crucified, you seek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the place where the Lord was lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>and having gone quickly, say you to his disciples, that he rose from the dead; and lo, he does go before you to Galilee, there you shall see him; lo, I have told you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo, Jesus met them, saying, 'Hail!' And they having come near, laid hold of his feet, and did bow to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Jesus to them, 'Fear you not, go away, tell to my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they shall see me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the things that happened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, 'Say you, that his disciples having come by night, stole him -- we being asleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and you keep free from anxiety.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>And they, having received the money, did as they were taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount where Jesus appointed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did waver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And having come near, Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'Given to me was all authority in heaven and on earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>having gone, then, disciple all the nations, (baptizing them -- to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all, whatever I did command you,) and lo, I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the age.'</verse>
