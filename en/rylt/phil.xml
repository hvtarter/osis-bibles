  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform it till a day of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>for your proving the things that differ, that you may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>for to me to live is Christ, and to die gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>And if to live in the flesh is to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct you yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>the same conflict having, such as you saw in me, and now hear of in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If, then, any exhortation is in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfil you my joy, that you may mind the same thing -- having the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>each not to your own look you, but each also to the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>For, let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So that, my beloved, as you always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom you do appear as luminaries in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>because of this do you also rejoice and joy with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>and the proof of him you know, that as a child serveth a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>And I thought it necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because you heard that he ailed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again you may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for you is sure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>look to the dogs, look to the evil-workers, look to the concision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>for we are the circumcision, who by the Spirit are serving God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and in flesh having no trust,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I also have cause of trust in flesh. If any other one doth think to have trust in flesh, I more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a Pharisee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things were to me gains, these I have counted, because of the Christ, loss;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>yes, indeed, and I count all things to be loss, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom of the all things I suffered loss, and do count them to be refuse, that Christ I may gain, and be found in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>not having my righteousness, which is of law, but that which is through faith of Christ -- the righteousness that is of God by the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>to know him, and the power of his rising again, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I did already obtain, or have been already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold; and one thing -- the things behind indeed forgetting, and to the things before stretching forth --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>As many, therefore, as are perfect -- let us think this, and if in anything you think otherwise, this also shall God reveal to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same thing think;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>become followers together of me, brethren, and observe those thus walking, according as you have us -- a pattern;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who the things on earth are minding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power, even to subject to himself the all things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand you in the Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>and I ask also you, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me, with Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord is near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as are grave, as many as are righteous, as many as are pure, as many as are lovely, as many as are of good report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things think upon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>the things that also you did learn, and receive, and hear, and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length you flourished again in caring for me, for which also you were caring, and lacked opportunity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>not that in respect of want I say it, for I did learn in the things in which I am -- to be content;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>but you did well, having communicated with my tribulation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>and you have known, even you Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except you only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need you sent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>and my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>and to God, even our Father, is the glory -- to the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute you every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the brethren with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>there salute you all the saints, and specially those of Caesar's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all. Amen.</verse>
