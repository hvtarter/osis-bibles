      <chapter osisID='2John.1'>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of your children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>and now I beseech you, Kyria, not as writing to you a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as you did hear from the beginning, that in it you may walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>See to yourselves that you may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, has not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one has both the Father and the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>if any one does come unto you, and this teaching does not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, 'Hail!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who is saying to him, 'Hail,' has fellowship with his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>salute you do the children of your choice sister. Amen.</verse>
