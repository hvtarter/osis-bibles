        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>beloved, concerning all things I desire you to prosper, and to be in health, even as your soul does prosper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you in truth do walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, faithfully do you do whatever you may work to the brethren and to the strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who did testify of your love before an assembly, whom you will do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- does not receive us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he does, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he does forbid, and out of the assembly he does cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, be not you following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil has not seen God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>to Demetrius testimony has been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and you have known that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>and I hope straightway to see you, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to you! salute you do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.</verse>
