  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>as they did deliver to us, who from the beginning became eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good also to me, having followed from the first after all things exactly, to write to you in order, most noble Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you may know the certainty of the things wherein you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>and they were both righteous before God, going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>and they had no child, because that Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, in his acting as priest, in the order of his course before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot was to make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>and all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the hour of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled, and fear fell on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>and the messenger said unto him, 'Fear not, Zacharias, for your supplication was heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>and there shall be joy to you, and gladness, and many at his birth shall joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full, even from his mother's womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>and he shall go before Him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make ready for the Lord, a people prepared.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said unto the messenger, 'Whereby shall I know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the messenger answering said to him, 'I am Gabriel, who have been standing near before God, and I was sent to speak unto you, and to proclaim these good news to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>and lo, you shall be silent, and not able to speak, till the day that these things shall come to pass, because you did not believe my words, that shall be fulfilled in their season.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>and having come out, he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary, and he was beckoning to them, and did remain dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>and after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>'Thus has the Lord done to me, in days in which He looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God, to a city of Galilee, the name of which is Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin, betrothed to a man, whose name is Joseph, of the house of David, and the name of the virgin is Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the messenger having come in unto her, said, 'Hail, favoured one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>and she, having seen, was troubled at his word, and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the messenger said to her, 'Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>and lo, you shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>he shall be great, and Son of the Highest he shall be called, and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages; and of his reign there shall be no end.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said unto the messenger, 'How shall this be, seeing a husband I do not know?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the messenger answering said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>and lo, Elizabeth, your kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>because nothing shall be impossible with God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, 'Lo, the maid-servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your saying,' and the messenger went away from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary having arisen in those days, went to the hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and spake out with a loud voice, and said, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>and whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord might come unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>for, lo, when the voice of your salutation came to my ears, leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>and happy is she who did believe, for there shall be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, 'My soul does magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant, For, lo, henceforth call me happy shall all the generations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For He who is mighty did to me great things, And holy is His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His kindness is to generations of generations, To those fearing Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He did powerfully with His arm, He scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He brought down the mighty from thrones, And He exalted the lowly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry He did fill with good, And the rich He sent away empty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He received again Israel His servant, To remember kindness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As He spake unto our fathers, To Abraham and to his seed -- to the age.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and turned back to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>And to Elizabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth, and she bare a son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her, and they were rejoicing with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>and his mother answering said, 'No, but he shall be called John.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said unto her -- 'There is none among your kindred who is called by this name,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>and they were making signs to his father, what he would wish him to be called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>and having asked for a tablet, he wrote, saying, 'John is his name;' and they did all wonder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>and his mouth was opened presently, and his tongue, and he was speaking, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came upon all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill-country of Judea were all these sayings spoken of,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts, saying, 'What then shall this child be?' and the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and did prophesy, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>'Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, Because He did look upon, And wrought redemption for His people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And did raise an horn of salvation to us, In the house of David His servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, Which have been from the age;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Salvation from our enemies, And out of the hand of all hating us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To do kindness with our fathers, And to be mindful of His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>An oath that He sware to Abraham our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To give to us, without fear, Out of the hand of our enemies having been delivered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>To serve Him, in holiness and righteousness Before Him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, Prophet of the Highest Shall you be called; For you shall go before the face of the Lord, To prepare His ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender mercies of our God, In which the rising from on high did look upon us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to those sitting in darkness and death-shade, To guide our feet to a way of peace.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days, there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world be enrolled --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was governor of Syria --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>and all were going to be enrolled, each to his proper city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife, being with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass, in their being there, the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and wrapped him up, and laid him down in the manger, because there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in the same region, lodging in the field, and keeping the night-watches over their flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the messenger said to them, 'Fear not, for lo, I bring you good news of great joy, that shall be to all the people --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>and this is to you the sign: You shall find a babe wrapped up, lying in the manger.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>'Glory in the highest to God, and upon earth peace, among men -- good will.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, when the messengers were gone away from them to the heavens, that the men, the shepherds, said unto one another, 'We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, that the Lord did make known to us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came, having hasted, and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>and having seen, they made known abroad concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard, did wonder concerning the things spoken by the shepherds unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>and Mary was preserving all these things, pondering in her heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>and the shepherds turned back, glorifying and praising God, for all those things they heard and saw, as it was spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, then was his name called Jesus, having been so called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>as it has been written in the Law of the Lord, -- 'Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to give a sacrifice, according to that said in the Law of the Lord, 'A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And lo, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name is Simeon, and this man is righteous and devout, looking for the comforting of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>and it has been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came in the Spirit to the temple, and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for their doing according to the custom of the law regarding him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>then he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>'Now You do send away Your servant, Lord, according to Your word, in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>because mine eyes did see Your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which You did prepare before the face of all the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light to the uncovering of nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken concerning him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, 'Lo, this one is set for the falling and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(and also your own soul shall a sword pass through) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, she was much advanced in days, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she is a widow of about eighty-four years, who did depart not from the temple, with fasts and supplications serving, night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>and she, at that hour, having come in, was confessing, likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him, to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they finished all things, according to the Law of the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their city Nazareth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>and when he became twelve years old, they having gone up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and having finished the days, in their returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>and, having supposed him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and were seeking him among the kindred and among the acquaintances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>and all those hearing him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And, having seen him, they were amazed, and his mother said unto him, 'Child, why did you thus to us? lo, your father and I, sorrowing, were seeking you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said unto them, 'Whyis it that you were seeking me? did you not know that in the things of my Father it is necessary for me to be?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>and they did not understand the saying that he spake to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>and he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was subject to them, and his mother was keeping all these sayings in her heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>and Jesus was advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>and he came to all the region round the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it has been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straightness, and the rough become smooth ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptized by him, 'Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father -- Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut down, and to fire it is cast.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, 'What, then, shall we do?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>and he answering said to them, 'He having two coats -- let him impart to him having none, and he having victuals -- in like manner let him do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptized, and they said unto him, 'Teacher, what shall we do?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>and he said unto them, 'Exact no more than that directed you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And questioning him also were those warring, saying, 'And we, what shall we do?' and he said unto them, 'Do violence to no one, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And the people are looking forward, and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether or not he may be the Christ;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>and having entered into one of the boats, that was Simon's, he asked him to put back a little from the land, and having sat down, was teaching the multitudes out of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he left off speaking, he said unto Simon, 'Put back to the deep, and let down your nets for a draught;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was breaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>and they beckoned to the partners, who are in the other boat, having come, to help them; and they came, and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass, in his being in one of the cities, that lo, a man full of leprosy, and having seen Jesus, having fallen on his face, he besought him, saying, 'Sir, if you may will, you are able to cleanse me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>and having stretched forth his hand, he touched him, having said, 'I will; be you cleansed;' and immediately the leprosy went away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he charged him to tell no one, 'But, having gone away, show yourself to the priest, and bring near for your cleansing according as Moses directed, for a testimony to them;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he was teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who were come out of every village of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was -- to heal them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>and he having seen their faith, said to him, 'Man, your sins have been forgiven you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, 'Who is this that does speak evil words? who is able to forgive sins, except God only?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said unto him, 'Therefore do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications -- in like manner also those of the Pharisees -- but yours do eat and drink?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he went into Capernaum;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>and having heard about Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, beseeching him, that having come he might thoroughly save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And they, having come near unto Jesus, were calling upon him earnestly, saying -- 'He is worthy to whom you shall do this,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus was going on with them, and now when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him friends, saying to him, 'Sir, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that under my roof you may enter;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>and the dead sat up, and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>and fear took hold of all, and they were glorifying God, saying -- 'A great prophet has risen among us,' and -- 'God did look upon His people.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, 'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>'And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>and those beside the way are those hearing, then comes the Devil, and takes up the word from their heart, lest having believed, they may be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>'And that which fell to the thorns: These are they who have heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and riches, and pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>'And that in the good ground: These are they, who in an upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retainit, and bear fruit in continuance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>and the demons having gone forth from the man, did enter into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake, and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And those feeding them, having seen what was come to pass, fled, and having gone, told it to the city, and to the fields;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>and those also having seen it, told them how the demoniac was saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did turn back.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, 'Whois it that touched me?' and all denying, Peter and those with him said, 'Master, the multitudes press you, and throng you, and you do say, Whois it that touched me!'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, 'Child, arise;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save;' and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass, as they are going on in the way, a certain one said unto him, 'I will follow you wherever you may go, sir;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>and Jesus said to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the fowls of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man has not where he may recline the head.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, 'It has been written, My house is a house of prayer -- but you made it a den of robbers.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people --</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he is teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming good news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and spake unto him, saying, 'Tell us by what authority you do these things? or who is he that gave to you this authority?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answering said unto them, 'I will question you -- I also -- one thing, and tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>the baptism of John, from heaven was it, or from men?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned with themselves, saying -- 'If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Therefore, then, did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>and if we may say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered, that they knew not whence it was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>and Jesus said to them, 'Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak unto the people this simile: 'A certain man planted a vineyard, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him, but the husbandmen having beat him, did sendhim away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>'And he added to send another servant, and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured, did send away empty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>and he added to send a third, and this one also, having wounded, they did cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>'And the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son -- the beloved, perhaps having seen this one, they will do reverence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>and having seen him, the husbandmen reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that the inheritance may become ours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>and having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killedhim; what, then, shall the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.' And having heard, they said, 'Let it not be!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>and he, having looked upon them, said, 'What, then, is this that has been written: A stone that the builders rejected -- this became head of a corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>every one who has fallen on that stone shall be broken, and on whom it may fall, it will crush him to pieces.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for they knew that against them he spake this simile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And, having watched him, they sent forth liers in wait, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his word, to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>and they questioned him, saying, 'Teacher, we have known that you do say and teach rightly, and do not accept a person, but in truth the way of God do teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>And he, having perceived their craftiness, said unto them, 'Why me do you tempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>show me a denary; of whom has it an image and superscription?' and they answering said, 'Of Caesar:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>and he said to them, 'Give back, therefore, the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people, and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>And certain of the Sadducees, who are denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, 'Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless -- that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>'There were, then, seven brothers, and the first having taken a wife, died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second took the wife, and he died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her, and in like manner also the seven -- they left not children, and they died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>and last of all died also the woman:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>in the rising again, then, of which of them does she become wife? -- for the seven had her as wife.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said to them, 'The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry, nor are they given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God, being sons of the rising again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>'And that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the Bush, since he does call the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>and He is not a God of dead men, but of living, for all live to Him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And certain of the scribes answering said, 'Teacher, you did say well;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>and no more did they question him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said unto them, 'How do they say the Christ to be son of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>and David himself said in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my lord, Sit you on my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>till I shall make your enemies your footstool;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And, all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>'Take heed of the scribes, who are wishing to walk in long robes, and are loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the suppers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the houses of the widows, and for a pretence make long prayers, these shall receive more abundant judgment.'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And having looked up, he saw those who did cast their gifts to the treasury -- rich men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>and he said, 'Truly I say to you, that this poor widow did cast in more than all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God, but this one out of her want, all the living that she had, did cast in.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>And certain saying about the temple, that with goodly stones and devoted things it has been adorned, he said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>And they questioned him, saying, 'Teacher, when, then, shall these things be? and what is the sign when these things may be about to happen?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>And he said, 'See -- you may not be led astray, for many shall come in my name, saying -- I amhe, and the time has come near; go not on then after them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>and when you may hear of wars and uprisings, be not terrified, for it is necessary for these things to happen first, but the endis not immediately.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then said he to them, 'Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>great shakings also in every place, and famines, and pestilences, there shall be; fearful things also, and great signs from heaven there shall be;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if I also questionyou, you will not answer me or send me away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>And they all said, 'You, then, are the Son of God?' and he said unto them, 'You sayit, because I am;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>and they said, 'What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear it from his mouth.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And having risen, the whole multitude of them did lead him to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>and began to accuse him, saying, 'This one we found perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate questioned him, saying, 'You are the king of the Jews?' and he answering him, said, 'You do sayit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilate said unto the chief priests, and the multitude, 'I find no fault in this man;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>and they were the more urgent, saying -- 'He does stir up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having begun from Galilee -- unto this place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man is a Galilean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in Jerusalem in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly, for he was wishing for a long time to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see done by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>and was questioning him in many words, and he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did send him back to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said unto them, 'You brought to me this man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in this man no fault in those things you bring forward against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>having chastised, therefore, I will release him,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying, 'Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they were calling out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he a third time said unto them, 'Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him, then, I will release him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests, were prevailing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>and he released him who because of sedition and murder has been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the cross, to bear it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there was following him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and lamenting him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>and Jesus having turned unto them, said, 'Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep you, and for your children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>for, lo, days do come, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that did not give suck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us; --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>for, if in the green tree they do these things -- in the dry what may happen?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also others -- two evil-doers -- with him, to be put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>and when they came to the place that is called Skull, there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they have not known what they do;' and parting his garments they cast a lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people were standing, looking on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, 'Others he saved, let him save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and offering vinegar to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, 'If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also a superscription written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, 'This is the King of the Jews.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the evil-doers who were hanged, was speaking evil of him, saying, 'If you be the Christ, save yourself and us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>And the other answering, was rebuking him, saying, 'Do you not even fear God, that you are in the same judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>and we indeed righteously, for things worthy of what we did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of place;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>and he said to Jesus, 'Remember me, lord, when you may come in your reign;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>and Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to you, To-day with me you shall be in the paradise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was, as it were, the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>and the sun was darkened, and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>and having cried with a loud voice, Jesus said, 'Father, to Your hands I commit my spirit;' and these things having said, he breathed forth the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And the centurion having seen what was done, did glorify God, saying, 'Really this man was righteous;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts did turn back;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>and all his acquaintances stood afar off, and women who did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a counsellor, a man good and righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>-- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was expecting the reign of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>he, having gone near to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>and having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And the day was a preparation, and sabbath was approaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his body was placed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>and having turned back, they made ready spices and ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according to the command.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first of the sabbaths, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bearing the spices they made ready, and certain others with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and having gone in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, while they are perplexed about this, that lo, two men stood by them in glittering apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and on their having become afraid, and having inclined the face to the earth, they said to them, 'Why do you seek the living with the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>he is not here, but was raised; remember how he spake to you, being yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying -- It is necessary for the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his sayings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>And it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women with them, who told unto the apostles these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they were not believing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having stooped down he sees the linen clothes lying alone, and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which is Emmaus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together, that Jesus himself, having come near, was going on with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>and their eyes were holden so as not to know him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>and he said unto them, 'Whatare these words that you exchange with one another, walking, and you are sad?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto him, 'Are you alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that you have not known the things that came to pass in it in these days?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, 'What things?' And they said to him, 'The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word, before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is passing to-day, since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>'And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming early to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he is alive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said unto them, 'O inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets spake!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not behooving the Christ these things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they came near to the village whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>and they constrained him, saying, 'Remain with us, for it is toward evening,' and the day did decline, and he went in to remain with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was giving to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became unseen by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, 'Was not our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was opening up to us the Writings?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying -- 'The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by Simon;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>and they were telling the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, 'Peace -- to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, 'Why are you troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see, because a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me having.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having said this, he showed to them the hands and the feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>and while they are not believing from the joy, and wondering, he said to them, 'Have you anything here to eat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and having taken, he did eat before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>and he said to them, 'Theseare the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it is necessary for to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and he said to them -- 'Thus it has been written, and thus it was behooving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>and you -- you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>'And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but you -- abide you in the city of Jerusalem till you be clothed with power from on high.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany, and having lifted up his hands he did bless them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
