  <div type='book' osisID='1Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you have known of what sort we became among you because of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>and you -- you did become imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>for from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you, and how you did turn unto God from the idols, to serve a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise out of the dead -- Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it did not become vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously treated (as you have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>for our exhortation is not out of deceit, nor out of uncleanness, nor in guile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is proving our hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as you have known,) nor in a pretext for covetousness, (God is witness!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others, being able to be burdensome, as Christ's apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish her own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because beloved you have become to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>for you remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for, night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you, we did preach to you the good news of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>you are witnesses -- God also -- how kindly and righteously, and blamelessly to you who believe we became,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>even as you have known, how each one of you, as a father his own children, we are exhorting you, and comforting, and testifying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His own reign and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>Because of this also, we -- we do give thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of hearing from us of God, you accepted, not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, who also does work in you who believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>for you became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things you suffered, even you, from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and did persecute us, and God they are not pleasing, and to all men are contrary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, but the anger did come upon them -- to the end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>And we, brethren, having been taken from you for the space of an hour -- in presence, not in heart -- did hasten the more abundantly to see your face in much desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>therefore we wished to come unto you, (I indeed Paul,) both once and again, and the Adversary did hinder us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>for what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not even you before our Lord Jesus Christ in his presence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>for you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and did send Timothy -- our brother, and a ministrant of God, and our fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ -- to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves have known that for this we are set,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come to pass, and you have known it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in vain might be our labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>And now Timothy having come unto us from you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us, as we also to see you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>because now we live, if you may stand fast in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>As to the rest, then, brethren, we request you, and call upon you in the Lord Jesus, as you did receive from us how it behooves you to walk and to please God, that you may abound the more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>for you have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>for this is the will of God -- your sanctification; that you abstain from the whoredom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that were not knowing God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother, because an avenger is the Lord of all these, as also we spake before to you and testified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>for God did not call us on uncleanness, but in sanctification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>he, therefore, who is despising -- does not despise man, but God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>And concerning the brotherly love, you have no need of my writing to you, for you yourselves are God-taught to love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for you do it also to all the brethren who are in all Macedonia; and we call upon you, brethren, to abound still more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we did command you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk becomingly unto those without, and may have lack of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that you may not sorrow, as also the rest who have not hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>for this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord -- may not precede those asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>because the Lord himself, in a shout, in the voice of a chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we who are living, who are remaining over, together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in air, and so always with the Lord we shall be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>so, then, comfort you one another in these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need of my writing to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night does so come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction does stand by them, as the travail does her who is with child, and they shall not escape;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>and you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>all you are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>therefore, comfort you one another, and build you up, one the one, as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue you, both to one another and to all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>always rejoice you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>continually pray you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>in every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>The Spirit quench not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>prophesyings despise not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>all things prove; that which is good hold fast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>from all appearance of evil abstain you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you! Amen.</verse>
