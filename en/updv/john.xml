      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into existence through him; and without him nothing came into existence. That which has come to exist</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>in him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness did not apprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>There was the true light, which lights every man, coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, and the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and those who were his own did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, glory as an only begotten from a father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bears witness of him, and cries out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me has become ahead of me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews from Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said therefore to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of Yahweh, as Isaiah the prophet said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water. Among you{+} stands one whom you{+} don't know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>[even] he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the next day he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who has become ahead of me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I didn't know him; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause I came baptizing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore witness, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it stayed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I didn't know him: but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and staying on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again on the next day John was standing, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and he looked on Jesus as he walked, and says, Look, the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus turned, and looked at them following, and says to them, What do you{+} seek? And they said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where do you stay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He says to them, Come, and you{+} will see. They came therefore and saw where he stayed; and they stayed with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two that heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He finds first his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked on him, and said, You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip: and Jesus says to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathaniel, and says to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathaniel said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and says of him, Look, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathaniel says to him, From where do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathaniel answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, you believe? You will see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, You{+} will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus says to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you{+}, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing about twenty or thirty gallons each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus says to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he says to them, Draw out now, and bear to the ruler of the feast. And they bore it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know from where it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calls the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine; and when [men] have drank freely, [then] that which is worse: you have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they did not stay there many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and to those who sold the doves he said, Take these things from here; don't make my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spoke this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, watching his signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, for that he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he did not need that anyone should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>the same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except one be born anew, he can't see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except one be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, You{+} must be born anew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it will, and you hear its voice, but do not know from where it comes, and where it goes: so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and you{+} do not receive our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I told you{+} earthly things and you{+} do not believe, how will you{+} believe if I tell you{+} heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whoever believes may in him have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes on him is not judged: but he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone who participates in evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been worked in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea; and there he spent some time with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, look, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything, except it has been given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You{+} yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all: he who is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaks: he who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he has seen and heard, of that he bears witness; and no man receives his witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who has received his witness has set his seal to [this], that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for he does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes on the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God stays on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>--although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples--</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must surely pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask me for a drink, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman says to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then do you have that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come all the way here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He says to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, You said well, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: this you have said truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you{+} say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you{+} worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You{+} worship that which you{+} don't know: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such does the Father seek to be his worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit: and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes (he who is called Christ): when he has come, he will declare to us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus says to her, I am he who speaks to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And on this his disciples came; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What do you seek? Or, Why do you speak with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man, who told me all things that I ever did: can this be the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meanwhile the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you{+} do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples therefore said one to another, Has any man brought him [anything] to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus says to them, My meat is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Don't you{+} say, There are yet four months, and [then] comes the harvest? Look, I say to you{+}, Lift up your{+} eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>Already he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this is the saying true, One sows, and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you{+} to reap that for which you{+} have not labored: others have labored, and you{+} have entered into their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they implored him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he went forth from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus came out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and implored [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said to him, Except you{+} see signs and wonders, you{+} will in no way believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus says to him, Go your way; your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying, that his boy lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>Now this is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, [and] withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been [sick] now a long time, he says to him, Do you want to be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus says to him, Arise, take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, He who made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up [your bed], and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he who was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Look, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these the Son also does in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and greater works than these he will show him, that you{+} may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, He who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, The hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Don't marvel at this: for the hour comes, in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and will come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have participated in evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>It is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You{+} have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But the witness which I receive is not from man: nevertheless I say these things, that you{+} may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the lamp that burns and shines; and you{+} were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who sent me, he has borne witness of me. You{+} have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you{+} do not have his word staying in you{+}: for whom he sent, him you{+} do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You{+} search the Scriptures, because you{+} think that in them you{+} have eternal life; and those are the ones which bear witness of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>and you{+} will not come to me, that you{+} may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you{+}, that you{+} do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father's name, and you{+} do not receive me: if another will come in his own name, him you{+} will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you{+} believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that [comes] from the only God, you{+} do not seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you{+} to the Father: there is one who accuses you{+}, [even] Moses, on whom you{+} have set your{+} hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you{+} believed Moses, you{+} would believe me; for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you{+} do not believe his writings, how will you{+} believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they were watching the signs which he did on those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude comes to him, says to Philip, From where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, $20,000 worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves, and two fish: but what are these among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to those who were set down; likewise also of the fish as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over to those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When therefore the men saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When therefore they had rowed about three or three and a half miles, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he says to them, It is I; don't be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except one, and that Jesus didn't enter with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples went away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>Other boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, You{+} seek me, not because you{+} saw signs, but because you{+} ate of the loaves, and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which stays to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you{+}: for him the Father, even God, has sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you{+} believe on him whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said therefore to him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Has not Moses given you{+} the bread out of heaven? But my Father gives you{+} the true bread out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them. I am the bread of life: he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you{+}, that you{+} have seen me, and yet do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that which the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will in no way cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone looking at the Son, and believing on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down out of heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me, except the Father who sent me draws him: and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Everyone who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God, he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, He who believes has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your{+} fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eats of this bread, he will live forever: yes and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Except you{+} eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you{+} don't have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood stays in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who eats me, he also will live because of me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard [this], said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you{+} to stumble?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>[What] then if you{+} should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I have spoken to you{+} are spirit, and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you{+} who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that should deliver him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, For this cause I have said to you{+}, that no man can come to me, except it is given to him of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>On this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do you{+} also want to go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed and know that you are the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you{+} the twelve, and one of you{+} is the devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who should deliver him up, [being] one of the twelve.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no man does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For even his brothers did not believe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come; but your{+} time is always ready.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses has given you{+} circumcision--not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers--and on the Sabbath you{+} circumcise a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you{+} angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And look, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>Nevertheless we know this man from where he is: but when the Christ comes, no one knows from where he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, You{+} both know me, and know from where I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you{+} don't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ will come, will he do more signs than those which this man has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to take him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you{+}, and I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You{+} will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you{+} cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we will not find him? will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this word that he said, You{+} will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, you{+} cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes on me, as the Scripture has said, from inside him will flow rivers of living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet [given]; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>[Some] of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why didn't you{+} bring him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The attendants answered, Never did man so speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are you{+} also led astray?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Has any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this multitude that doesn't know the law are accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, he who came to him before, being one of them, says to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>Does our law judge a man, except it first hear from him and know what he does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee rises no prophet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>They said therefore to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You{+} know neither me, nor my Father: if you{+} knew me, you{+} would know my Father also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>He said therefore again to them, I go away, and you{+} will seek me, and will die in your{+} sin: where I go, you{+} can't come.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said therefore to him, Who are you? Jesus said to them, Even that which I have also spoken to you{+} from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you{+}: nevertheless he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I speak to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They didn't perceive that he spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus therefore said to them, When you{+} have lifted up the Son of Man, then you{+} will know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spoke these things, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If you{+} stay in my word, [then] you{+} are truly my disciples;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You{+} are of the father the devil, and the desires of your{+} father it is your{+} will to do.

        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you{+} dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>But I don't seek my own glory: there is one who seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, If a man keeps my word, he will never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Therefore the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died: whom do you make yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me; of whom you{+} say, He is our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>and you{+} have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I don't know him, I will be like you{+}, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your{+} father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Before Abraham was born, I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw him previously, that he was a beggar, said, Isn't this he who sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They said therefore to him, How then were your eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered, The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>And they said to him, Where is he? He says, I don't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They bring to the Pharisees him who previously was blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was the Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>They say therefore to the blind man again, What do you say of him, in that he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and asked them, saying, Is this your{+} son, who you{+} say was born blind? How then does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents therefore answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know: ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So they called a second time the man who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God does not hear sinners: but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Never was it heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, For a good work we don't stone you, but for blasphemy; and because you, being a man, make yourself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your{+} law, I said, you{+} are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do you{+} say of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am [the] Son of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore they sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatever John spoke of this man were true.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, look, he whom you love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed at that time two days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he says to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you; and do you go there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he spoke: and after this he says to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus therefore said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your{+} sakes that I was not there, to the intent you{+} may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about two miles away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>And even now I know that, whatever you will ask of God, God will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus says to her, Your brother will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believes on me, though he dies, yet he will live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and whoever lives and believes on me will never die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, [even] he who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews [also] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have you{+} laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews therefore said, Look at how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus says, Take{+} away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, says to him, Lord, by this time the body decays; for he has been [dead] four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus says to her, Did I not say to you, that, if you believed, you should see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the multitude that stands around I said it, that they may believe that you sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>He who was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw that which he did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a Sanhedrin, and said, What do we do? This man does many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You{+} know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you{+} take account that it is expedient for you{+} that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now this he did not say of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They sought therefore for Jesus, and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you{+} think? That he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus therefore six days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who sat to eat with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should deliver him up, says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why wasn't this ointment sold for $30,000, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus therefore said, Allow her to keep it against the day of my burying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you{+} always have with you{+}; but me you{+} do not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>The large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day the great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed [is] he who comes, the King of Israel, in the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion: look, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples did not understand at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Look at how you{+} prevail nothing: look, the world has gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew: Andrew comes, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answers them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of Man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Except a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it stays alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will also my servant be: if any man serves me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, [saying], I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel has spoken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice has not come for my sake, but for your{+} sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world: now will the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ stays forever: and how do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you{+}. Walk while you{+} have the light, that darkness does not overtake you{+}: and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you{+} have the light, believe on the light, that you{+} may become sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and he departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things, because he saw his glory; and he spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [it], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried and said, He who believes on me, does not believe on me, but on him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who looks at me looks at him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me may not stay in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hears my sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him: for I didn't come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me, and does not receive my sayings, has one who judges him: the word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I did not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.2'>In my Father's house are many places to stay; if it were not so, would I tell you{+} that I go to prepare a place for you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.3'>And if I go and prepare a place for you{+}, I come again, and will receive you{+} to myself; that where I am, [there] you{+} may be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.4'>And where I go, you{+} know the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.5'>Thomas says to him, Lord, we don't know where you are going; how can we know the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.6'>Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, but by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.7'>If you{+} have known me, you{+} will also know my Father: and from now on you{+} know him, and have seen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.8'>Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.9'>Jesus says to him, Have I been so long time with you{+}, and don't you know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how do you say, Show us the Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.10'>Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I say to you{+} I don't speak from myself: but the Father staying in me does his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.11'>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: otherwise believe for the very works' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.12'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, he who believes on me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater [works] than these he will do; because I go to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.13'>And whatever you{+} will ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.14'>If you{+} will ask me anything in my name, I will do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.15'>If you{+} love me, you{+} will keep my commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.16'>And I will pray the Father, and he will give you{+} another Comforter, that he may be with you{+} forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.17'>[even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world can't receive; for it does not see him, neither knows him: you{+} know him; for he stays with you{+}, and will be in you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.18'>I will not leave you{+} desolate: I come to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.19'>Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you{+} see me: because I live, you{+} will live also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.20'>In that day you{+} will know that I am in my Father, and you{+} in me, and I in you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.21'>He who has my commandments, and keeps them, it is he who loves me: and he who loves me will be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.22'>Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, Lord, and what has come to pass that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.23'>Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make a place to stay with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.24'>He who does not love me does not keep my words: and the word which you{+} hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.25'>These things I have spoken to you{+}, while [yet] staying with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.26'>But the Comforter, [even] the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you{+} all things, and bring to your{+} remembrance all that I said to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.27'>Peace I leave with you{+}; my peace I give to you{+}: not as the world gives, I give to you{+}. Don't let your{+} heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.28'>You{+} heard how I said to you{+}, I go away, and I come to you{+}. If you{+} loved me, you{+} would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.29'>And now I have told you{+} before it comes to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you{+} may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.30'>I will no more speak much with you{+}, for the prince of the world comes: and he has nothing in me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.31'>but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.1'>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.2'>Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes it away: and every [branch] that bears fruit, he cleanses it, that it may bear more fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.3'>Already you{+} are clean because of the word which I have spoken to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.4'>Stay in me, and I in you{+}. As the branch can't bear fruit of itself, except it stays in the vine; so neither can you{+}, except you{+} stay in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.5'>I am the vine, you{+} are the branches: He who stays in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit: for apart from me you{+} can do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.6'>If a man does not stay in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.7'>If you{+} stay in me, and my words stay in you{+}, ask whatever you{+} will, and it will be done to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.8'>In this is my Father glorified, that you{+} may bear much fruit and may be my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.9'>Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you{+}: stay{+} in my love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.10'>If you{+} keep my commandments, you{+} will stay in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and stay in his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.11'>These things I have spoken to you{+}, that my joy may be in you{+}, and [that] your{+} joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.12'>This is my commandment, that you{+} love one another, even as I have loved you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.13'>Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.14'>You{+} are my friends, if you{+} do the things which I command you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.15'>No longer do I call you{+} slaves; for the slave doesn't know what his lord does: but I have called you{+} friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.16'>You{+} did not choose me, but I chose you{+}, and appointed you{+}, that you{+} should go and bear fruit, and [that] your{+} fruit should stay: that whatever you{+} will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.17'>These things I command you{+}, that you{+} may love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.18'>If the world hates you{+}, you{+} know that it has hated me before [it hated] you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.19'>If you{+} were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you{+} are not of the world, but I chose you{+} out of the world, therefore the world hates you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.20'>Remember the word that I said to you{+}, A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you{+}; if they kept my word, they will keep yours{+} also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.21'>But all these things they will do to you{+} for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.22'>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.23'>He who hates me hates my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.24'>If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.25'>But [this comes to pass], that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.26'>When the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you{+} from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness of me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.27'>and you{+} also bear witness, because you{+} have been with me from the beginning.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.16'>
        <verse osisID='John.16.1'>These things I have spoken to you{+}, that you{+} should not be caused to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.2'>They will put you{+} out of the synagogues: yes, the hour comes, that whoever kills you{+} will think that he offers service to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.3'>And these things they will do, because they haven't known the Father, nor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.4'>But these things I have spoken to you{+}, that when their hour has come, you{+} may remember them, how that I told you{+}. And these things I didn't say to you{+} from the beginning, because I was with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.5'>But now I go to him who sent me; and none of you{+} asks me, Where do you go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.6'>But because I have spoken these things to you{+}, sorrow has filled your{+} heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.7'>Nevertheless I tell you{+} the truth: It is expedient for you{+} that I go away; for if I don't go away, the Comforter will not come to you{+}; but if I go, I will send him to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.8'>And he, when he has come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.9'>of sin, because they do not believe on me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.10'>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you{+} see me no more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.11'>of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.12'>I have yet many things to say to you{+}, but you{+} can't bear them now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.13'>Nevertheless when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you{+} into all the truth: for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he will hear, he will speak: and he will declare to you{+} the things that are to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.14'>He will glorify me: for he will take of mine, and will declare [it] to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.15'>All things that the Father has are mine: therefore I said, that he takes of mine, and will declare [it] to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.16'>A little while, and you{+} see me no more; and again a little while, and you{+} will see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.17'>[Some] of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you{+} don't see me; and again a little while, and you{+} will see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.18'>They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? We don't know what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.19'>Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said to them, Do you{+} inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and you{+} don't see me, and again a little while, and you{+} will see me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.20'>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, that you{+} will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: you{+} will be sorrowful, but your{+} sorrow will be turned into joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.21'>A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour has come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.22'>And you{+} therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you{+} again, and your{+} heart will rejoice, and your{+} joy no one takes away from you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.23'>And in that day you{+} will ask me no question. Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, if you{+} will ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.24'>Until now have you{+} asked nothing in my name: ask, and you{+} will receive, that your{+} joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.25'>These things I have spoken to you{+} in dark sayings: the hour comes, when I will no more speak to you{+} in dark sayings, but will tell you{+} plainly of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.26'>In that day you{+} will ask in my name: and I don't say to you{+}, that I will pray the Father for you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.27'>for the Father himself loves you{+}, because you{+} have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.28'>I came out from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.29'>His disciples say, Look, now you speak plainly, and speak no dark saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.30'>Now we know that you know all things, and don't need that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.31'>Jesus answered them, Do you{+} now believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.32'>Look, the hour comes, yes, has come, that you{+} will be scattered, every man to his own, and will leave me alone: and [yet] I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.33'>These things I have spoken to you{+}, that in me you{+} may have peace. In the world you{+} have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.17'>
        <verse osisID='John.17.1'>These things Jesus spoke; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that the son may glorify you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.2'>even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him, he should give eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.3'>And this is eternal life, that they should know you the only true God, and him whom you sent, [even] Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.4'>I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work which you have given me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.5'>And now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.6'>I manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world: they were yours, and you gave them to me; and they have kept your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.7'>Now they know that all things that you have given me are from you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.8'>for the words which you gave me I have given to them; and they received [them], and knew of a truth that I came forth from you, and they believed that you sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.9'>I pray for them: I don't pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me; for they are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.10'>and all things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine: and I am glorified in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.11'>And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.12'>While I was with them, I kept them in your name which you have given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.13'>But now I come to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.14'>I have given them your word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.15'>I don't pray that you should take them from the world, but that you should keep them from the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.16'>They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.17'>Sanctify them in the truth: your word is truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.17.21'>that they may all be one; even as you, Father, [are] in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.18'>
        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where a garden was, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Now Judas also, who delivered him up, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Judas then, having received the battalion [of soldiers], and attendants from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and says to them, Whom do you{+} seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. He says to them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who delivered him up, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When therefore he said to them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again therefore he asked them, Whom do you{+} seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, I told you{+} that I am [he]; if therefore you{+} seek me, let these go their way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me I lost not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. Now the slave's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>So the battalion and the colonel, and the attendants of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>The female slave therefore that kept the door says to Peter, Are you also [one] of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now the slaves and the attendants were standing [there], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret I spoke nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard [me], what I spoke to them: look, these know the things which I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And when he had said this, one of the attendants standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why do you strike me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Are you also [one] of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the slaves of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Didn't I see you in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter therefore denied again: and right away the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate therefore went out to them, and says, What accusation do you{+} bring against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your{+} law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell it to you concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me: what have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then my attendants would fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end I have been born, and to this end I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate says to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you{+} have a custom, that I should release to you{+} one at the Passover: do you{+} want therefore that I release to you{+} the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and they came to him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate went out again, and says to them, Look, I bring him out to you{+}, that you{+} may know that I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And [Pilate] says to them, Look, the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate says to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and says to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore says to him, Don't you speak to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered him, You would have no power against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>On this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation of the Passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Look, your{+} King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your{+} King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. They took Jesus therefore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, to the place called, The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on each side, and between them [was] Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it will be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, And on my vesture they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he says to his mother, Woman, here is your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he says to the disciple, Here is your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own [home].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the Scripture might be accomplished, says, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and delivered up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not stay on the cross on the Sabbath (for the day of that Sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers therefore came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>nevertheless one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knows that he says true, that you{+} also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things came to pass, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, They will look at him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb in which man was never yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There then because of the Jews' Preparation (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first [day] of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, to the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>She runs therefore, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping and looking in, he sees the linen cloths lying; yet he did not enter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter therefore also comes, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he looks at the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin, that was on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>So the disciples went away again to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and she looks at two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, Woman, why do you weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had thus said, she turned back, and looks at Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus says to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says to him, Sir, if you have borne him from here, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus says to her, Mary. She turns herself, and says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus says to her, Do not touch me; for I have not yet ascended to the Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your{+} Father, and my God and your{+} God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene comes and tells the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle [of the room], and says to them, Peace [be] to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had said this, he showed to them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] to you{+}: as the Father has sent me, even so I send you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says to them, Receive{+} the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>those whose sins you{+} forgive, they are forgiven to them; those whose [sins] you{+} retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will in no way believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle [of the room], and said, Peace [be] to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he says to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and see my hands; and reach [here] your hand, and put it into my side: and don't be faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus says to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed [are] those who have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other signs therefore Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written, that you{+} may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you{+} may have life in his name.</verse>
