      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I urge you, O Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, that keeps covenant and loving-kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your slave, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel your slaves while I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house have sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>we have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your slave Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I urge you, the word that you commanded your slave Moses, saying, If you{+} trespass, I will scatter you{+} abroad among the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if you{+} return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your{+} outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to make my name stay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are your slaves and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I urge you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your slave, and to the prayer of your slaves, who delight to fear your name; and prosper, I pray you, your slave this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been [formerly] sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very intensely afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said to the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king, If it pleases the king, and if your slave has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long will your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover I said to the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which pertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the slave, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for man came to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither did I tell man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, but the beast that I rode on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the Dragon's Well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers didn't know where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them, You{+} see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we will no more be a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the slave, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you{+} do? Will you{+} rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his slaves will arise and build: but you{+} have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of the Hundred they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And next to him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox goes up, he will break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach on their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>and don't cover their iniquity, and don't let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have provoked [you] to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half [the height] of it: for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very angry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They will not know, neither see, until we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, You{+} must return to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore I set in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Don't be{+} afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your{+} brothers, your{+} sons, and your{+} daughters, your{+} wives, and your{+} houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my attendants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>All of them built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>and the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>in whatever place you{+} hear the sound of the trumpet, resort{+} there to us; our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let every one with his attendant lodge inside Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my attendants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were some that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were also some that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also some that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute [on] our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons as their sons: and, look, we bring into slavery our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are brought into slavery [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You{+} exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and would you{+} even sell your{+} brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and never found a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, The thing that you{+} do is not good: Shouldn't you{+} walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>And I likewise, my brothers and my attendants, lend them money and grain. I pray you{+}, let us leave off this usury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you{+}, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you{+} exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so we will do, even as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that does not perform this promise; even thus will he be shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Yahweh. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors who were before me were chargeable to the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their attendants bore rule over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land: and all my attendants were gathered there to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the service was heavy on this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do mischief to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can't come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his attendant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you would be their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now, come and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For all of them would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it will not be done. So now, strengthen my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night they will come to slay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should a man such as I flee? And who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I discerned, and saw that God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For this cause he was hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said to them, Don't let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar{+} them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] across from his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few in it, and the houses were not built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.1'>And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.2'>And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.3'>And he read it before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were [attentive] to the Book of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.4'>And Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.5'>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.6'>and Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.7'>Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people [stood] in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.8'>And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.9'>And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Yahweh your{+} God; don't mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.10'>Then he said to them, Go your{+} way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord: neither be{+} grieved; for the joy of Yahweh is your{+} strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.11'>So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your{+} peace, for the day is holy; neither be{+} grieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.12'>And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.13'>And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' [houses] of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.14'>And they found written in the law, how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the sons of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.15'>and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.16'>So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.17'>And all the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the sons of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.18'>Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.9'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.1'>Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the sons of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.2'>And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.3'>And they stood up in their place, and read in the Book of the Law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.4'>Then stood up on the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.5'>Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Yahweh your{+} God from everlasting to everlasting; and let them bless your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.6'>You are Yahweh, even you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.7'>You are Yahweh the God, who chose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.8'>and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.9'>And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.10'>and showed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his slaves, and on all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and you made a name for yourself, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.11'>And you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers you cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.12'>Moreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.13'>You came down also on mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.14'>and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your slave,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.15'>and gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.16'>But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and didn't listen to your commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.17'>and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in Egypt appointed a captain to return to their slavery. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, and did not forsake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.18'>Yes, when they had made themselves a molten calf, and said, This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.19'>yet you in your manifold mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.20'>You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn't withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.21'>Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes didn't wax old, and their feet didn't swell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.22'>Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.23'>You also multiplied their sons as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.24'>So the sons went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.25'>And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns cut out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.26'>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and slew your prophets that testified against them to turn themselves again to you, and they wrought great provocations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.27'>Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.28'>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.29'>and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn't listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, which if man does, he will live in them, and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.30'>Yet many years you bore with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet they would not give ear: therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and don't wipe away my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading donkeys [with them]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold victuals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>Men of Tyre also dwelt in it, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you{+} do, and profane the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Didn't your{+} fathers do thus, and didn't our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? Yet you{+} bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath: and some of my attendants I set over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do you{+} lodge about the wall? If you{+} do so again, I will lay hands on you{+}. From that time forth they came no more on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving-kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also I saw the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], You{+} will not give your{+} daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your{+} sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Didn't Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then listen to you{+} to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</verse>
