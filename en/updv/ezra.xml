      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whoever there is among you{+} of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whoever is left, in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then the heads of fathers' [houses] of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all those who were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Yahweh, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>even those Cyrus king of Persia brought forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty altered,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.2.70'>So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people: and the singers, and the porters, and those given [to temple service] dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar on its base; for fear was on them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings on it to Yahweh, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and [offered] the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and [the offerings] of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill-offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to Yahweh: but the foundation of the temple of Yahweh was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, to them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began. And they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and Binnui [and] Hodaviah together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Yahweh, after the order of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, [saying], For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endures] forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the foundation of the house of Yahweh was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' [houses], the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' [houses], and said to them, Let us build with you{+}; for we seek your{+} God, as you{+} do; and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' [houses] of Israel, said to them, You{+} have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes: Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his fellow slaves, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian [character], and set forth in the Syrian [tongue].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>then [wrote] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their fellow slaves, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest [of the country] beyond the River, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your slaves the men beyond the River, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known to the king, that the Jews that came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now to the king, that, if this city is built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and certified the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so you will find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition inside the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We inform the king that, if this city is built, and the walls finished, by this means you will have no portion beyond the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>[Then] the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their fellow slaves who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest [of the country] beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which you{+} sent to us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I decreed, and search has been made, and it was found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all [the country] beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Make{+} now a decree to cause these [work]men to cease, and that this city will not be built, until a decree will be made by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>And take heed that you{+} are not slack in this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their fellow slaves, they went in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel [they prophesied] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time Tattenai came to them, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their fellow slaves, and said thus to them, Who gave you{+} a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the [work]men were who were making this building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his fellow slaves the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who gave you{+} a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked them their names also, to inform you, that we might write the names of the [work]men who were at the head of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the slaves of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>and he said to him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then the same Sheshbazzar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now it has been in building, and yet it is not completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let there be a search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king made a decree, and a search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.2'>And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and in it was thus written for a record:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height threescore cubits, and its width threescore cubits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and you will put them in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.6'>Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your{+} fellow slaves the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be{+} far from there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.7'>let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.8'>Moreover I make a decree what you{+} will do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses will be given with all diligence to these [work]men, that they are not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.9'>And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; [also] wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.10'>that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.11'>Also I have made a decree, that whoever will alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.12'>and the God who has caused his name to stay there overthrow all kings and peoples who will put forth their hand to alter [the same], to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.13'>Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their fellow slaves, because Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.14'>And the elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.15'>And this house was finished on the twenty-third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.16'>And the sons of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.17'>And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.18'>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the Book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.19'>And the sons of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves, all of them as one, but all the exiles had not purified themselves; for the Levites, all of them as one, were pure: and they killed the Passover for all the sons of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>And the sons of Israel that had come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.22'>and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.6'>this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Yahweh his God on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.7'>And there went up some of the sons of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and those given [to temple service], to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.10'>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.11'>Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh, and of his statutes to Israel:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.1'>Now these are the heads of their fathers' [houses], and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.6'>And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.7'>And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.8'>And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him eighty males.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.14'>And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur; and with them seventy males.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.15'>And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.17'>And I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say to Iddo, [and] his brothers those given [to temple service], at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.18'>And according to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.19'>and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.20'>and of those given [to temple service], whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>So we fasted and implored our God for this: and he was entreated of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred silver vessels [weighing...] talents; of gold a hundred talents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.27'>and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright bronze, precious as gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>And I said to them, You{+} are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering to Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>Watch{+}, and keep them, until you{+} weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' [houses] of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.30'>So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.31'>Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambusher by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.32'>And we came to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.33'>And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.34'>the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.35'>The sons of the captivity, that had come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and two lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.36'>And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, haven't separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, [doing] according to their disgusting things, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.5'>And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.6'>and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>Since the days of our fathers we have been exceedingly guilty to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And now for a little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we are slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended loving-kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>which you have commanded by your slaves the prophets, saying, The land, to which you{+} go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their disgusting behaviors, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>now therefore do not give your{+} daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your{+} sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you{+} may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your{+} sons forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples who do these disgusting things? Wouldn't you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is this day: look, we are before you in our guiltiness; for none can stand before you because of this.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.1'>Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very intensely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.4'>Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you: be of good courage, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.5'>Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the Levitical priests, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.6'>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and he spent the night there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.8'>and that whoever didn't come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.9'>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth [day] of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.10'>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You{+} have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.11'>Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.12'>Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As you have said concerning us, so must we do.</verse>
