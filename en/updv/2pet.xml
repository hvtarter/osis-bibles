      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of Jesus Christ, our God and Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Grace to you{+} and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you{+} may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>Yes, and for this very cause adding on your{+} part all diligence, in your{+} faith supply virtue; and in [your{+}] virtue knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and in [your{+}] knowledge self-control; and in [your{+}] self-control patience; and in [your{+}] patience godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and in [your{+}] godliness brotherly kindness; and in [your{+}] brotherly kindness love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things are yours{+} and abound, they make you{+} to not be idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your{+} calling and election sure: for if you{+} do these things, you{+} will never stumble:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>for thus will be richly supplied to you{+} the entrance into the eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I will be ready always to put you{+} in remembrance of these things, though you{+} know them, and are established in the truth which is with [you{+}].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you{+} up by putting you{+} in remembrance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>Yes, I will be diligent that at every time you{+} may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you{+} the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>and this voice we [ourselves] heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And we have the word of prophecy [made] more sure; to which you{+} do well that you{+} take heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the day-star arises in your{+} hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spoke from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you{+} also there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their sexual immorality; by reason of whom the way of the truth will be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And in greed they will with feigned words make merchandise of you{+}: whose sentence now from of old does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare angels who sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and delivered them to chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example to those who should live ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and delivered righteous Lot, very distressed by the sexual immorality of the wicked</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] lawless deeds):</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment to the day of judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the desire of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble to rail at dignities:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters of which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>suffering wrong as the wages of wrongdoing; [men] that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery, and that can't cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in greed; sons of cursing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the [son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a mute donkey spoke with man's voice and restrained the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For, uttering great swelling [words] of vanity, they entice in the desires of the flesh, by sexual immorality, those who are just escaping from the ones who live in error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for to whom a man is overcome, to this one he has been made a slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse with them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>It has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This is now, beloved, the second letter that I write to you{+}; and in both of them I stir up your{+} sincere mind by putting you{+} in remembrance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>that you{+} should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through your{+} apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come with mockery, walking after their own desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amid water, by the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which means the world that then was, being overflowed in water, perished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is long-suffering toward you{+}, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you{+} to be in [all] holy living and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, seeing that you{+} look for these things, be diligent that you{+} may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all [his] letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as [they do] also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You{+} therefore, beloved, knowing [these things] beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, you{+} fall from your{+} own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. To him [be] the glory both now and forever. Amen.</verse>
