      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, Yahweh will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn, and the top of Carmel will wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it will devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it will devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because he pursued his brother with the sword, and had cast off all pity, and his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>but I will send a fire on Teman, and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have ripped up the pregnant women of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it will devour its palaces, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>and their king will go into captivity, he and his princes together, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>but I will send a fire on Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>and I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will slay all its princes with him, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers walked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>but I will send a fire on Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>those who pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go to the [same] maiden, to profane my holy name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you{+} up out of the land of Egypt, and led you{+} forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up of your{+} sons for prophets, and of your{+} young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O you{+} sons of Israel? says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But you{+} gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Don't prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Look, I will press [you{+}] in your{+} place, as a cart presses that is full of sheaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>And flight will perish from the swift; and the strong will not strengthen his force; neither will the mighty deliver himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>neither will he stand that handles the bow; and he who is swift of foot will not deliver [himself]; neither will he who rides the horse deliver himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked in that day, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you{+}, O sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You{+} only I have known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit all your{+} iniquities on you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Will two walk together, except they have agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has taken nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare on the earth, where no trap is [set] for him? Will a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Will the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? Will evil befall a city, and Yahweh has not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Sovereign Yahweh will do nothing, except he reveals his secret to his slaves the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Sovereign Yahweh has spoken; who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish{+} in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and look at what great tumults are in it, and what oppressions are in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they don't know to do right, says Yahweh, who stores up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: An adversary [there will be], even round about the land; and he will bring down your strength from you, and your palaces will be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus says Yahweh: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so will the sons of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear{+}, and testify against the house of Jacob, says the Sovereign Yahweh, the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>For in the day that I will visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar will be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will strike the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory will perish, and the great houses will have an end, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, you{+} kine of Bashan, who are in the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Sovereign Yahweh has sworn by his holiness, that, look, the days will come upon you{+}, that they will take you{+} away with hooks, and your{+} residue with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And you{+} will go out at the breaches, everyone straight before her; and you{+} will be cast toward Harmon, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, [and] multiply transgression; and bring your{+} sacrifices every morning, [and] your{+} tithes every three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleases you{+}, O you{+} sons of Israel, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you{+} cleanness of teeth in all your{+} cities, and want of bread in all your{+} places; yet you{+} have not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And I also have withheld the rain from you{+}, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city: one piece was rained on, and the piece on which it did not rain withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet you{+} have not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have struck you{+} with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your{+} gardens and your{+} vineyards and your{+} fig-trees and your{+} olive-trees has the palmer-worm devoured: yet you{+} have not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent among you{+} the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your{+} young men I have slain with the sword, and have carried away your{+} horses; and I have made the stench of your{+} camp to come up even into your{+} nostrils: yet you{+} have not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown [cities] among you{+}, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you{+} were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet you{+} have not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; [and] because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, look, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares what his thought is to man; who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the Earth--Yahweh, the God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear{+} this word which I take up for a lamentation over you{+}, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she will no more rise: she is cast down on her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: The city that went forth a thousand will have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred will have ten left, to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel, Seek{+} me, and you{+} will live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>but don't seek Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and don't pass to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal will surely go into captivity, and Beth-el will come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek Yahweh, and you{+} will live; or else he will break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it will devour, and there will be none to quench it in Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>You{+} who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>[seek him] that makes the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night; that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth (Yahweh is his name);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>that brings sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they are disgusted by him who speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Forasmuch therefore as you{+} trample on the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: you{+} have built houses of cut stone, but you{+} will not dwell in them; you{+} have planted pleasant vineyards, but you{+} will not drink their wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know how manifold are your{+} transgressions, and how mighty are your{+} sins--you{+} who afflict the just, who take a bribe, and who turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time; for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good, and not evil, that you{+} may live; and so Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be with you{+}, as you{+} say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing will be in all the broad ways; and they will say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! And they will call the husbandman to mourning, and a wailing for such as are skillful in lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And in all vineyards will be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of you, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to you{+} who desire the day of Yahweh! Why would you{+} have the day of Yahweh? It is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Will not the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your{+} feasts, and I will take no delight in your{+} solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Yes, though you{+} offer me your{+} burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your{+} fat beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Did you{+} bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>Yes, you{+} have borne the tabernacle of your{+} king and the Kewan--your{+} idols, the star of your{+} god which you{+} made to yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore I will cause you{+} to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says Yahweh, whose name is the God of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass{+} to Calneh, and see; and from there go{+} to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? Or is their border greater than your{+} border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>--you{+} who put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>who lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>who sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore they will now go captive with the first that go captive; and the revelry of those who stretched themselves will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Sovereign Yahweh has sworn by himself, says Yahweh, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it will come to pass, if ten men remain in one house, that they will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And when a man's uncle will take him up, even he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and will say to him who is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with you? And he will say, No; then he will say, Hold your peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, look, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be struck with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Will horses run on the rock? Will one plow [there] with oxen? that you{+} have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>you{+} who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>For, look, I will raise up against you{+} a nation, O house of Israel, says Yahweh, the God of hosts; and they will afflict you{+} from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus the Sovereign Yahweh showed me: and, look, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, look, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Sovereign Yahweh, forgive, I urge you: how will Jacob stand? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>Yahweh repented concerning this: It will not be, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus the Sovereign Yahweh showed me: and, look, the Sovereign Yahweh called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then I said, O Sovereign Yahweh, cease, I urge you: how will Jacob stand? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>Yahweh repented concerning this: this also will not be, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed me: and, look, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And Yahweh said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Look, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them anymore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>and the high places of Isaac will be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos says, Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also Amaziah said to Amos, O you seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>but don't prophesy again anymore at Beth-el; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now therefore hear the word of Yahweh: You say, Don't prophesy against Israel, and don't drop [your word] against the house of Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>therefore thus says Yahweh: Your wife will prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, and your land will be divided by line; and you yourself will die in a land that is unclean, and Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>Thus the Sovereign Yahweh showed me: and, look, a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And he said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then Yahweh said to me, The end has come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple will be wailings in that day, says the Sovereign Yahweh: the dead bodies will be many: in every place they will cast them forth with silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, O you{+} who would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.6'>that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.7'>Yahweh has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.8'>Will not the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn that dwells in it? Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River; and it will be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.9'>And it will come to pass in that day, says the Sovereign Yahweh, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.10'>And I will turn your{+} feasts into mourning, and all your{+} songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and its end as a bitter day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.11'>Look, the days come, says the Sovereign Yahweh, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.12'>And they will wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they will run to and fro to seek the word of Yahweh, and will not find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.13'>In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.14'>Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As your god, O Dan, lives; and, As the pilgrimage of Beer-sheba lives; they will fall, and never rise up again.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.1'>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Strike the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them to pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there will not one of them flee away, and there will not one of them escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'>Though they dig into Sheol, from there will my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there; and though they are hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.4'>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will slay them: and I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.5'>For the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, [is] he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>[it is] he who builds his staircase in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'>Are you{+} not as the sons of the Ethiopians to me, O sons of Israel? says Yahweh. Haven't I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'>Look, the eyes of the Sovereign Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; except that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.9'>For, look, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like [grain] is sifted in a sieve, yet the least kernel will not fall on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.10'>All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, The evil will not overtake nor meet us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.11'>In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that has fallen, and close up its breaches; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.12'>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, says Yahweh who does this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.13'>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who sows seed; and the mountains will drop sweet wine, and all the hills will melt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.14'>And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they will build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and drink their wine; they will also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.15'>And I will plant them on their land, and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, says Yahweh your God.</verse>
