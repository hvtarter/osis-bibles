      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his slaves, [even] the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified [it] by his angel to his slave John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, [even] of all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it: for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you{+} and peace, from Him Who Is and Who Was and Who Is To Come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and he made us [to be] a kingdom, [to be] priests to his God and Father; to him [be] the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Look, he comes with the clouds; and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Yahweh God, He Who Is and Who Was and Who Is To Come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your{+} brother and copartner with you{+} in the tribulation and kingdom and patience [which are] in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, What you see, write in a book and send [it] to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and among the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girded about at the breasts with a golden belt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>And his head and his hair were white as white wool, [white] as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet like burnished bronze, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying, Don't be afraid; I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the Living one; and I became dead, and look, I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write therefore the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which will come to pass after these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands are seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works, and your toil and patience, and that you can't bear evil men, and tried those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and you have patience and did bear for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have [this] against you, that you left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to you, and will move your lampstand out of its place, except you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived [again]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your tribulation, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Don't at all fear the things which you are about to suffer: look, the devil is about to cast some of you{+} into prison, that you{+} may be tried; and you{+} will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt of the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where you dwell, [even] where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast my name, and did not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you{+}, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So you have also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore; or else I come to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished bronze:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works, and your love and faith and service and patience, and that your last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have [this] against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess; and she teaches and seduces my slaves to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time that she should repent; and she does not want to repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Look, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts: and I will give to each one of you{+} according to your{+} works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you{+} I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who don't know the deep things of Satan, as they say; I cast on you{+} no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Nevertheless that which you{+} have, hold fast until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>as I also have received of my Father: and I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have not found your works perfected before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how you have received and heard; and keep [it], and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments: and they will walk with me in white; for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes will thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no way blot his name out of the Book of Life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says he who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and none will shut, and who shuts and none opens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works (look, I have set before you a door opened, which none can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my word, and did not deny my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Look, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie; look, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of trial, that [hour] which is to come upon the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly: hold fast that which you have, that no one takes your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I would you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and don't know that you are the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy of me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and [that] the shame of your nakedness not be made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Look, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, [a voice] as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things which must come to pass hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in the Spirit: and look, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>and he who sat [was] to look at like a jasper stone and a sardius: and [there was] a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne [were] four and twenty thrones: and on the thrones [I saw] four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like a crystal; and among the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first creature [was] like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature [was] like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes around and inside: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, [is] Yahweh, the God of hosts, He Who Was and Who Is and Who Is To Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when the living creatures will give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the four and twenty elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne, and will worship him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for you created all things, and because of your will they were, and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written on the inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look on it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>and one of the elders says to me, Do not weep; look, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the book and its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw among the throne and of the four living creatures, and among the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came, and he takes [it] out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy are you to take the book, and to open its seals: for you were slain, and purchased to God with your blood [men] of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and made them [to be] to our God a kingdom and priests; and they will reign on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was tens of thousands of tens of thousands, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things are in them, I heard saying, To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, [be] the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked, and saw a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and there was given to him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another [horse] came forth, a red horse: and to him who sat on it, it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they will slay one another: and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I looked, and saw a black horse; and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard as it were a voice among the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for $100, and three measures of barley for $100; and don't hurt the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked, and saw a pale horse: and he who sat on him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Sovereign Yahweh, Holy and True, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to each of them a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow slaves also and their brothers, who should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled [their course].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the strong, and all--slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of their wrath has come; and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, that proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>in the midst of her street. And on this side of the river and on that was a tree of life that bears fruit twelve [times per year], every month yielding its fruit: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there will be no curse anymore: and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in her: and his slaves will serve him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there will be no more night; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for Yahweh God will give them light: and they will reign forever and ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I John am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he says to me, Don't do it: I am a fellow slave with you and with your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book: worship God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>He who is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he who is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he who is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he who is holy, let him be made holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>Look, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according to as his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right [to come] to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and makes a lie.</verse>
