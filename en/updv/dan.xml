  <div osisID='Dan' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in [certain] of the sons of Israel, even of the royal seed and of the nobles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end of it they should stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were, of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>And the prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave [the name of] Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, [of] Shadrach; and to Mishael, [of] Meshach; and to Azariah, [of] Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your{+} food and your{+} drink: for why should he see your{+} faces worse looking than the youths who are of your{+} own age? So you{+} would endanger my head with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove your slaves, I urge you, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked on before you, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's dainties; and as you see, deal with your slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he listened to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that ate of the king's dainties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the sacred scholars and psychics who were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even to the first year of King Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the sacred scholars, and the psychics, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever: tell your slaves the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing has gone from me: if you{+} don't make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you{+} will be cut in pieces, and your{+} houses will be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if you{+} show the dream and its interpretation, you{+} will receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his slaves the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that you{+} would gain time, because you{+} see the thing has gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if you{+} don't make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you{+}; for you{+} have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time is changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you{+} can show me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth that can show the king's matter, since no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any sacred scholar, or psychic, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his colleagues to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his colleagues:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his colleagues should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>he reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank you, and praise you, O you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in a hurry, and said thus to him, I have found a [prominent] man of the sons of the captivity of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, psychics, sacred scholars, nor astrologers, show to the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>but there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>as for you, O king, your thoughts came [into your mind] on your bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>You, O king, looked, and saw a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its aspect was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>and wherever the sons of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens he has given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after you will arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of bronze, which will bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, since you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they will not stick one to another, even as iron does not mingle with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of those kings will the God of heaven set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Since you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your{+} God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you have been able to reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and its width six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then the herald cried aloud, To you{+} it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>that at what time you{+} hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you{+} fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>and whoever does not fall down and worship will the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Therefore at that time [prominent] men, Chaldeans, came near and brought accusation against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who will hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, will fall down and worship the golden image;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and whoever does not fall down and worship, will be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are Jewish [prominent] men whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these [prominent] men, O king, have not regarded you: they don't serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these [prominent] men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it on purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you{+} don't serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if you{+} are ready that at what time you{+} hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you{+} fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if you{+} don't worship, you{+} will be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that will deliver you{+} out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it is [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded mighty [prominent] men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these [prominent] men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire slew those [prominent] men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three [prominent] men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in a hurry: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn't we cast three [prominent] men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Look, I see four [prominent] men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, you{+} slaves of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these [prominent] men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his slaves who trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, will be cut in pieces, and their houses will be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! And how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then the sacred scholars, the psychics, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the sacred scholars, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I looked, and saw a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to heaven, and its sight to the end of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, look, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for awhile, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, don't let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and its sight to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>whose leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and on whose branches the birds of the heavens stayed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>it is you, O king, that have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, until seven times pass over him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>that you will be driven from men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field, and you will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom will be sure to you, after that you will have known that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>and you will be driven from men; and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field; you will be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can hold back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.5'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.3'>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.4'>They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.5'>In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote across from the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.6'>Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.7'>The king cried aloud to bring in the psychics, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever will read this writing, and show me its interpretation, will be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.8'>Then all the king's wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.9'>Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.10'>[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spoke and said, O king, live forever; don't let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.11'>There is a [prominent] man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, [I say], your father, made him master of the sacred scholars, psychics, Chaldeans, and astrologers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>since an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.13'>Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.14'>I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.16'>But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you will be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.17'>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.18'>You, O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.19'>and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.21'>and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts', and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.22'>And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.23'>but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drank wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which don't see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand is your breath, and are all your ways, you have not glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.25'>And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.26'>This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and brought it to an end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.27'>TEKEL; you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.28'>PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.29'>Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.30'>In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.31'>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.6'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.1'>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.2'>and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, since he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>Then these [prominent] men said, We will not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.6'>Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whoever will ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he will be cast into the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>Therefore King Darius signed the writing and the interdict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he knelt on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did previously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>Then these [prominent] men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's interdict: Have you not signed an interdict, that every man who will make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, will be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, does not regard you, O king, nor the interdict that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>Then the king, when he heard these words, was intensely displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then these [prominent] men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.16'>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.17'>And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in a hurry to the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, slave of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; since before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.23'>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.24'>And the king commanded, and they brought those [prominent] men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.25'>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.26'>I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, And his kingdom [is] that which will not be destroyed; and his dominion will be even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.27'>He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.28'>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.7'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, look, the four winds of heaven broke forth on the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I looked until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And, look, another beast, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I looked, and saw another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night-visions, and, look, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and, look, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, look, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I looked until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] its wheels burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I looked at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night-visions, and, look, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given to him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom [is] that which will not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that will arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I looked, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said, The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be diverse from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom will ten kings arise: and another will arise after them; and he will be diverse from the former, and he will put down three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High; and he will think to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, look, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long will be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then the sanctuary will be cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, look, there stood before me as the appearance of a [prominent] man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'>And I heard man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O Son of Man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Look, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.20'>The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.21'>The he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.22'>And as for that which was broken, in the place of which four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will destroy wonderfully, and will prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>And through his policy he will cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security he will destroy many: he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>And the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true: but you shut up the vision; for it belongs to many days [to come].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the word, and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>I lifted up my eyes, and looked and saw a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished bronze, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn't see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And, look, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he said to me, O Daniel, you man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for now I have been sent away to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>Then he said to me, Don't be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard: and I have come for your words' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, look, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'>And, look, one in the likeness of the sons of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I retain no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'>For how can the slave of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.7'>But out of a shoot from her roots will one stand up in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them, and will prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.8'>And also their gods, with their molten images, [and] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, he will carry captive into Egypt; and he will refrain some years from the king of the north.</verse>
