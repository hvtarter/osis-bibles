      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>Count it all joy, my brothers, when you{+} fall into manifold trials;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>Knowing that the proving of your{+} faith works patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>And let patience have [its] perfect work, that you{+} may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>But if any of you{+} lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and does not upbraid; and it will be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing: for he who doubts is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For do not let that man think that he will receive anything of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>a man who leads a double life, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>But let the brother who is lowly glory in his high [position];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and the rich, in his low [position]: because as the flower of the grass he will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass: and its flower falls, and the grace of its fashion perishes: so also will the rich man fade away in his ventures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man who endures trial; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which [the Lord] promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God can't be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own desire, and enticed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then the desire, when it has conceived, bears sin: and the sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights [of heaven]; with whom there is neither shift in position, nor shadow that is cast by turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>You{+} know [this], my beloved brothers. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your{+} souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But be{+} doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your{+} own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>for he looks at himself, and goes away, and right away forgets what manner of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But he who looks into the perfect law, the [law] of liberty, and stays [with it], not being a hearer that forgets but a doer that works, this man will be blessed in his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any man thinks himself to be religious, while he doesn't bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if there comes into your{+} synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there comes in also a poor man in vile clothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you{+} have regard to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, You sit here in a good place; and you{+} say to the poor man, You stand there, or sit under my footstool;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Don't you{+} make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brothers; did not God choose those who are poor as to the world [to be] rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you{+} have dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you{+}, and themselves drag you{+} into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you{+} are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>Nevertheless if you{+} fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You will love your fellow man as yourself, you{+} do well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>but if you{+} have respect of persons, you{+} commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whoever will keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he has become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he who said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you do not commit adultery, but kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak{+}, and so do{+}, as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment [is] without mercy to him who has shown no mercy: mercy glories against judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What does it profit, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but doesn't have works? Can that faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you{+} says to them, Go in peace, be{+} warmed and filled; and yet you{+} don't give them the things needful to the body; what does it profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Even so faith, if it doesn't have works, is dead in itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith apart from [your] works, and I by my works will show you [my] faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that there is [only] one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But do you want to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You see that faith was working with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You{+} see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>And in like manner wasn't also Rahab the prostitute justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Don't many [of you{+}] be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For in many things we all stumble. If any doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Now if we put the horses' bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Look, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, where the impulse of the helmsman wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>So the tongue also is a little member, and boasts great things. Look, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But the tongue no man can tame; [it is] a restless evil, [it is] full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless the Lord and Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt water yield sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and understanding among you{+}? Let him show, by his good life, his works in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you{+} have bitter jealousy and faction in your{+} heart, don't glory and don't lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not [a wisdom] that comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile action.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>From where [come] wars and from where [come] fightings among you{+}? Don't [they come] from here, [even] of your{+} pleasures that war in your{+} members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You{+} lust and don't have; so you{+} kill. And you{+} covet and cannot obtain; so you{+} fight and war. You{+} don't have, because you{+} don't ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You{+} ask, and don't receive, because you{+} ask amiss, that you{+} may spend [it] in your{+} pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>You{+} adulteresses, don't you{+} know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or do you{+} think that in vain the Scripture says, The spirit which he made to dwell in us longingly desires to [the point of] envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he gives more grace. Therefore [the Scripture] says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Be subject therefore to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you{+}. Cleanse your{+} hands, you{+} sinners; and purify your{+} hearts, you{+} who lead a double life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your{+} laughter be turned to mourning, and your{+} joy to heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Don't speak one against another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is [only] one lawgiver and judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy: but who are you that judge your fellow man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, you{+} who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and will gain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>whereas you{+} don't know what will be on the next day. What is your{+} life? For you{+} are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead you{+} ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you{+} glory in your{+} vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>To him therefore that knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now, you{+} rich, weep and howl for your{+} miseries that are coming upon you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your{+} riches are corrupted, and your{+} garments are moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your{+} gold and your{+} silver are rusted; and their rust will be for a testimony against you{+}, and will eat your{+} flesh as fire. You{+} have laid up your{+} treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Look, the wages of the workers who mowed your{+} fields, which you{+} kept back by fraud, cries out: and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You{+} have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your{+} pleasure; you{+} have nourished your{+} hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You{+} have condemned, you{+} have killed the righteous; he does not resist you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Look, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be{+} also patient; establish your{+} hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Don't murmur, brothers, one against another, that you{+} are not judged: look, the judge stands before the doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Look, we call them blessed that endured: you{+} have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your{+} yes be yes, and your{+} no, no; that you{+} may not fall under judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any among you{+} suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any among you{+} sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>and the prayer of faith will save him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess therefore your{+} sins one to another, and pray one for another, that you{+} may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man avails much in its working.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brothers, if any among you{+} errs from the truth, and one converts him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know, that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
