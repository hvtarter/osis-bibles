      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O Yahweh, how long shall I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you of violence, and you will not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perverseness? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law is slacked, and justice does never go forth; for the wicked circles about the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Look{+} among the nations, and see{+}, and wonder{+} marvelously; for a work is working in your{+} days, which you{+} will not believe though it is told you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For, look, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that marches through the width of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>They are terrible and awesome; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: and they ride from afar; they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him; he derides every stronghold; for he heaps up dust, and takes it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then he will sweep by [as] a wind, and will pass over, and be guilty, [even] he whose might is his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>Are not you from everlasting, O Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment; and you, O Rock, have established him for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>You who are of purer eyes than to look at evil, and who cannot look at perverseness, why do you look on betrayers, and hold your peace when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>and make man as the fish of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>He takes up all of them with the angle, he catches them in his net, and gathers them in his drag: therefore he rejoices and is glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Will he therefore draw his sword, and not spare to slay the nations continually?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand on my watch, and set myself on the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And Yahweh answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he may run that reads it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and will not lie: though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Look, his soul is presumptuous, it is not upright in him; but the righteous will live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>And how much more arrogant is a betrayer, a haughty [able-bodied] man, that does not keep at home; who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and can't be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Will not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him who increases that which is not his! How long? And that loads himself with pledges!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Will they not rise up suddenly that will bite you, and awake that will vex you, and you will be for booty to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber will answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Look, is it not of Yahweh of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe to him who gives his fellow man drink, mixing your strong wine, and make him drunk also, that you may look at their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>You are filled with shame, and not glory: you also drink, and show your foreskin; the cup of Yahweh's right hand will come round to you, and foul shame will be on your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you, and the destruction of the beasts, which will frighten you; because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What does it profit the graven image, that its maker has graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake; Arise! [And] to the mute stone, It will teach. Look, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But Yahweh is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silent before him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O Yahweh, I have heard the report of you, and am afraid: O Yahweh, revive your work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood, and measured the earth; He looked, and drove apart the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills bowed down; His goings were [as] of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers, Or your wrath against the sea, That you rode on your horses, On your chariots of salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>Your bow was bared naked; By means of a word the arrows are assigned by oath. Selah. You split the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains saw you, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of your arrows as they went, At the shining of your glittering spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>You marched though the land in indignation; You threshed the nations in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>You went forth for the salvation of your people, For the salvation of your anointed; You wounded the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>You pierced with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>You trod the sea with your horses, The heap of mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invades us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>For though the fig-tree will not flourish, Neither will fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive will fail, And the fields will yield no food; The flock will be cut off from the fold, And there will be no herd in the stalls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength; And he makes my feet like hinds' [feet] And will make me to walk on my high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.</verse>
