  <div osisID='Mark' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make{+} ready the way of Yahweh, Make his paths straight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John the Baptist came in the wilderness and was preaching a baptism of repentance to remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the country of Judea, and all those of Jerusalem went out to him; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and [had] a leather belt about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying, There comes after me he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you{+} in water; But he will baptize you{+} in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent apart, and the Spirit as a dove descending on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came out of the heavens, You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And right away the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days tried by Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels were serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent{+}, and believe{+} in the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, Come{+} after me, and I will make you{+} to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left the nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on a little further, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat preparing the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they go into Capernaum; and right away on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And right away there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And right away, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and right away they tell him of her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And at evening, when the sun set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many who were sick with diverse diseases, and cast out many demons; and he didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and they found him, and say to him, All are seeking you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end I came forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there comes to him a leper, imploring him, and kneeling down, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and says to him, I will; be made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and says to him, See [that] you say nothing to any man: but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room [for them], no, not even about the door: and he spoke the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come, bringing to him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to bring [the man] to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And Jesus seeing their faith says to the sick of the palsy, Child, your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this man thus speak? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins but one, God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned to themselves, says to them, Why do you{+} reason these things in your{+} hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he says to the sick of the palsy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he arose, and immediately took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it comes to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said to his disciples, [How is it] that he eats with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it, he says to them, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick: I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up takes from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perishes, and the skins: but [they put] new wine into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass, that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he says to them, Did you{+} never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says to the man who had his hand withered, Stand in the middle [of the synagogue].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth [your] hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went out, and right away with the Herodians gave counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed on him that they might touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they looked at him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he charged them much that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he himself wanted; and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he appointed the twelve: and he gave the name Peter to Simon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he gave them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And he comes into a house. And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom can't stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one can enter into the house of the strong [man], and spoil his goods, except he first binds the strong [man]; and then he will spoil his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Truly I say to you{+}, All their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies by whichever they will blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever will blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his mother and his brothers come; and, standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Look, your mother and your brothers and your sisters outside seek for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answers them, and says, Who is my mother and my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking around on those who sat around him, he says, Here are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever will do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the seaside. And there is gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Listen: Look, the sower went forth to sow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some [seed] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other [seed] fell on the rocky [ground], where it did not have much earth; and right away it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>and when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And other [seed] fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, Who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, To you{+} is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he says to them, Do you{+} not know this parable? And how will you{+} know all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are those by the wayside, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, right away Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are those who are sown on the rocky [places], who, when they have heard the word, right away receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for awhile; then, when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are those who are sown among the thorns; these are those who have heard the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And those are the ones who were sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, [and] not to be put on the lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, except that it should be manifested; neither was [anything] made secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, Take heed what you{+} hear: with what measure you{+} mete it will be measured to you{+}; and more will be given to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The earth bears fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is [ready to] deliver, right away he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or in what parable shall we set it forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under its shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>and without a parable he did not speak to them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And on that day, when evening came, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there rises a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they wake him, and say to him, Teacher, don't you care that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, Why are you{+} fearful? Have you{+} not yet faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he came out of the boat, right away there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could anymore bind him, no, not with a chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying out with a loud voice, he says, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him, What is your name? And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he implored him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine being shepherded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And they implored him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, [in number] about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And those who shepherded them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they come to Jesus, and look at him who was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, [even] him who had the legion: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who saw it declared to them how it befell him who was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to urge him to depart from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed with demons implored him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>And he did not allow him, but says to him, Go to your house to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and [how] he had mercy on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him: and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falls at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and implores him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: [I pray you], that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been getting better, but rather grew worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard about Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I touch but his garments, I will be made whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power [proceeding] from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he yet spoke, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house] saying, Your daughter is dead: why do you trouble the Teacher any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Don't be afraid, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he allowed no man to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he sees a tumult, and [many] weeping and wailing greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he had entered in, he says to them, Why do you{+} make a tumult, and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, takes the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and goes in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking the child by the hand, he says to her, Talitha koum; which is, being interpreted, Girl, I say to you, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the girl rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed immediately with a great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that [something] should be given her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out from there; and he comes into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things?

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Isn't this the son of the carpenter and Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the surrounding villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he calls to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>and he charged them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, except a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money in their belt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but [he said], fasten on sandals and don't put on two coats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard [of it], for his name had become known. And they said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, [It is] a prophet, [even] as one of the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; don't be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were very amazed in themselves beyond measure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they didn't understand concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and ran around that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those who were sick, where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and implored him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, except when the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked them, What do you{+} question with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And he asked his father, How much time is it since this has come to him? And he said, From a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And often it has cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent to them another slave; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And when they had come, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and do not care about [what] anyone [thinks]; for you do not regard the person of men, but of a truth teach the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you{+} make trial of me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection, when they will rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, Is it not for this cause that you{+} err, that you{+} don't know the Scriptures, nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But as concerning the dead, that they are raised; have you{+} not read in the Book of Moses, in [the place concerning] the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you{+} do greatly err.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and having seeing that he answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this, You will love your fellow man as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to him, Of a truth, Teacher, you have well said that he is one; and there is no other but he:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his fellow man as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said in the Holy Spirit, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, Until I set your enemies under your feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and [to have] salutations in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many who were rich cast in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two dollars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly I say to you{+}, This poor widow cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>And when you{+} will hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled: [these things] must surely come to pass; but the end is not yet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, I am: and you{+} will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>And the high priest rent his clothes, and says, What further need do we have of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You{+} have heard the blasphemy: what do you{+} think? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants received him with blows of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was beneath in the court, there comes one of the female slaves of the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him, and says, You also were with the Nazarene, [even] Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you say: and he went out into the porch; and the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the slave saw him, and she began again to say to those who stood by, This is [one] of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, of a truth you are [one] of them; for you are a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse, and to swear, I don't know this man of whom you{+} speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And right away the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me thrice. And when he thought on it, he wept.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And right away in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And answering he says to him, You say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate again asked him, saying, Do you answer nothing? Look how many things they accuse you of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one called Barabbas, [lying] bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the multitude went up and began to ask him [to do] as he usually did for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>And Pilate answered them, saying, Do you{+} want that I release to you{+} the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate again answered and said to them, Then what do you{+} want me to do [with him] whom you{+} call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away inside the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he did not receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he can't save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And those who were crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour came, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Look, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let [him] be; let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the captain, who stood by across from him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were also women watching from far: among whom [were] both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and were serving him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And when evening was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councilor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the captain, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he learned it of the captain, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the [mother] of Joses looked at where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they were saying among themselves, Who will roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And looking up, they see that the stone has been rolled back: for it was exceedingly great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he says to them, Don't be amazed: you{+} seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: look, the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goes before you{+} into Galilee: there you{+} will see him, as he said to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</verse>
