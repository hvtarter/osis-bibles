  <div osisID='1Sam' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim of the Zuphites, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>but to Hannah he gave a special portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival provoked her intensely, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? And why don't you eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept intensely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your slave, and remember me, and not forget your slave, but will give to your slave a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli was watching her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice wasn't heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Don't count your slave for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation I have spoken until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let your slave find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her countenance was no more [sad].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up early in the morning, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah had sex with Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah became pregnant, and gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the lad is weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and remain there forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to you; tarry until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman tarried and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the lad was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew the bull, and brought the lad to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here by you, praying to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>I prayed for this lad; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>therefore I also have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. And he worshiped Yahweh there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh; My horn is exalted in Yahweh; My mouth is enlarged over my enemies; Because I rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy like Yahweh; For there is none besides you, Neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Don't talk anymore so exceedingly proudly; Don't let arrogance come out of your{+} mouth; For Yahweh is a God of knowledge, And by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men are broken; And those who stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread; And those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]: Yes, the barren has borne seven; And she who has many sons languishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>Yahweh kills, and makes alive: He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich: He brings low, he also lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust, He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's, And he has set the world on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked will be put to silence in darkness; For by strength no man will prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>Yahweh - He will shatter the ones who contend against him; Above him [that contends] he thunders in heaven: Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength to his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the lad was ministering to Yahweh before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the custom of the priests with the people was that, when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's attendant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's attendant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you will give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And the sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for they despised the offering of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a lad, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you [Elkanah] seed of this woman in place of the petition which he asked of Yahweh. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And Yahweh visited Hannah, and she became pregnant, and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the lad Samuel grew before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do you{+} do such things? For I hear of your{+} evil dealings from all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons; for the report that I hear is not good: you{+} make Yahweh's people to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If a man sins against another man, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the lad Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And a man of God came to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when, in Egypt, they belonged to the house of Pharaoh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why do you{+} kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Look, the days are coming, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there will not be an old man in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And you will see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] will give Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of yours, [whom] I will not cut off from my altar, [will be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house will die as men [before they become old].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this will be the sign to you, that will come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will die both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise myself up a faithful priest, that will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it will come to pass, that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the lad Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. And the word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was laying down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And he said, I didn't call; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And Yahweh called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And he answered, I didn't call, my son; lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it will be, if he calls you, that you will say, Speak, Yahweh; for your slave hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your slave hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And Yahweh said to Samuel, Look, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons cursed God, and he did not restrain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? I pray you, don't hide it from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Yahweh: he will do what seems good to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined the battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits [above] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Yahweh came into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who will deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and conduct yourselves like men, O you{+} Philistines, or else you{+} will be slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you{+}: conduct yourselves like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And he came and saw that Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What is the noise of this tumult? And the man hurried, and came and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did it go, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And he who brought the news answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was pregnant, near to be delivered: and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a son. But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the lad Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God was taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And those of Ashdod arose early on the next day, and saw Dagon fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And they arose early in the morning on the next day, and saw Dagon fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel will not remain with us; for his hand is intense on us, and on Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>And the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the attendants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.4'>And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn't find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.5'>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his attendant that was with him, Come, and let us return, or else my father will leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.6'>And he said to him, Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says surely comes to pass: now let us go there; perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.7'>Then Saul said to his attendant, But, look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what do we have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.8'>And the attendant answered Saul again, and said, Look, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.9'>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.12'>And they answered them, and said, He is; look, [he is] before you: hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.13'>as soon as you{+} come into the city, you{+} will right away find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice; [and] afterward they who are invited will eat.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.14'>And they went up to the city; [and] as they came inside the city, look, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.15'>Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.16'>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you will anoint him to be leader over my people Israel; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.17'>And when Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Look, the man of whom I spoke to you! This same will have authority over my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.18'>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.19'>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you{+} will eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.20'>And as for your donkeys being lost now these three days, don't set your mind on them; for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.21'>And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then did you speak to me after this manner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.22'>And Samuel took Saul and his attendant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.23'>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.24'>And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Look, that which has been reserved!

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.25'>And when they had come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul on the housetop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.26'>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Rise up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.27'>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the attendant to pass on before us (and he passed on), but you stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.3'>Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor; and you will meet there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.5'>After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is: and it will come to pass, when you come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.6'>and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you will prophesy with them, and will be turned into another man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.8'>And you will go down before me to Gilgal; and, look, I will come down to you, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days you will tarry, until I come to you, and show you what you will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.9'>And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.10'>And when they came there to the hill, look, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.11'>And it came to pass, when all who knew him formerly saw that, look, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.12'>And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.14'>And Saul's uncle said to him and to his attendant, Where did you{+} go? And he said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.2'>And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition I will make it with you{+}, that all your{+} right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.3'>And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is none to save us, we will come out to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.4'>Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.5'>And, look, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.6'>And the Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was greatly kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.7'>And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so it will be done to his oxen. And the dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>And he numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And they said to the messengers that came, Thus you{+} will say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you{+} will have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you{+}, and you{+} will do with us all that seems good to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And it was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that those who remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Will Saul reign over us? Bring the men, that we may put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>And Saul said, There will not be a man put to death this day; for today Yahweh has wrought deliverance in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.1'>And Samuel said to all Israel, Look, I have listened to your{+} voice in all that you{+} said to me, and have made a king over you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.2'>And now, see, the king walks before you{+}; and I am old and grayheaded; and, see, my sons are with you{+}: and I have walked before you{+} from my youth to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.3'>Here I am: witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes with it? And I will restore it you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.4'>And they said, You haven't defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.5'>And he said to them, Yahweh is witness against you{+}, and his anointed is witness this day, that you{+} have not found anything in my hand. And they said, He is witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.6'>And Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your{+} fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.7'>Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you{+} before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you{+} and to your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.8'>When Jacob came into Egypt, and your{+} fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your{+} fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.9'>But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.10'>And they cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.11'>And Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you{+} out of the hand of your{+} enemies on every side; and you{+} dwelt in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.12'>And when you{+} saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you{+}, you{+} said to me, No, but a king will reign over us; when Yahweh your{+} God was your{+} king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.13'>Now therefore here is the king whom you{+} have chosen, and whom you{+} have asked for: and see that Yahweh has set a king over you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.14'>If you{+} will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you{+} and also the king who reigns over you{+} are followers of Yahweh your{+} God, [well]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.15'>but if you{+} will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you{+}, as it was against your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.16'>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your{+} eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.17'>Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you{+} will know and see that your{+} wickedness is great, which you{+} have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking for yourselves a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.18'>So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.19'>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your slaves to Yahweh your God, that we will not die; for we have added to all our sins [this] evil, to ask for ourselves a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.20'>And Samuel said to the people, Don't be afraid; you{+} have indeed done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your{+} heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.21'>and don't turn{+} aside; for [then would you{+} go] after vain things which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.22'>For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you{+} a people to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.23'>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you{+}: but I will instruct you{+} in the good and the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.24'>Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your{+} heart; for consider what great things he has done for you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.25'>But if you{+} will still do wickedly, you{+} will be consumed, both you{+} and your{+} king.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>Saul was... years old when he began to reign; And he reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was a stench to the Philistines. And the people had gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>And Saul said, Bring the burnt-offering here to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, look, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>therefore I said, Now will the Philistines come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you haven't kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you: for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now your kingdom will not continue: Yahweh has sought himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be leader over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal, and went on his way. But the remainder of the people went up after Saul to meet the battlefolk, and they went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, remained in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Or else the Hebrews will make swords or spears:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his coulter, and his ax, and his mattock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the three-pronged fork, and for the axes, and to set the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But he didn't tell his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>And Saul remained in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armorbearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn yourself, look, I am with you according to your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then said Jonathan, Look, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you{+}; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand: and this will be the sign to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>And both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Look, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you{+} something. And Jonathan said to his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within, as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceedingly great trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw that the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who has gone from us. And when they had numbered, look, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was [there] at that time with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>And Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and saw that every man's sword was against his fellow man, [and there was] a very great panic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Now the Hebrews who were formerly with the Philistines, and who went up with them into the camp round about, even they also [came] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also stuck [closely] after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people had come to the forest, look, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan didn't hear when his father charged the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then one of the people answered, and said, Your father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day. And the people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you{+}, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>And they struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>Then they told Saul, saying, Look, the people sin against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, you{+} have betrayed [Yahweh]: roll a great stone to me this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar to Yahweh: the same was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>And Saul said, Draw near here, all you{+} chiefs of the people; and know and see in what this sin has been this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he will surely die. But there wasn't a man among all the people who answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then he said to all Israel, You{+} be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Why haven't you answered your slave today? If the guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, Yahweh, God of Israel, give Urim; but if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim. And Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, look, I must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>And Saul said, God do so and more also; for you will surely die, Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>And the people said to Saul, Will Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Yahweh lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he did not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>And he did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.51'>And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>And there was intense war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.1'>And Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.2'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, I have remembered that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.3'>Now go and strike Amalek, and completely destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, go{+} down from among the Amalekites, or else I will destroy you{+} with them; for you{+} showed kindness to all the sons of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.7'>And Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.8'>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.9'>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and the oxen, and the seconds, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed completely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.10'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.12'>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, look, he set up for himself a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.13'>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of Yahweh: I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.14'>And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.15'>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we have completely destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.16'>Then Samuel said to Saul, Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.17'>And Samuel said, Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.18'>and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, Go, and completely destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.19'>Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.20'>And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.21'>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.22'>And Samuel said, Does Yahweh have as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Look, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion is as the sin of fortune-telling, and stubbornness is as idolatry and talismans. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.25'>Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said to him, Yahweh has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to your fellow man, who is better than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.29'>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not man, that he should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.30'>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.31'>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.32'>Then Samuel said, Bring{+} here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.33'>And Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.34'>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.35'>And Samuel didn't come to see Saul anymore until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.1'>And Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go: I will send you to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided myself a king among his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.2'>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.3'>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you will do: and you will anoint to me him whom I name to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.4'>And Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Do you come peaceably?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.5'>And he said, Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.6'>And it came to pass, when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.7'>But Yahweh said to Samuel, Don't look on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [it is] not [a matter of] what man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks on the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.8'>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.9'>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.10'>And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.11'>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your lads here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, look, he is shepherding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.12'>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had handsome eyes, and was good-looking. And Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.13'>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.14'>Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.15'>And Saul's slaves said to him, Look now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.18'>Then one of the young men answered, and said, Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, who is skillful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.19'>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.20'>And Jesse took a donkey [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.1'>Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.12'>Now David was the son of a man, an Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man, in the days of Saul, was old and notable among men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.28'>And Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.29'>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.30'>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the slaves of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.1'>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his slaves, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Don't let the king sin against his slave, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh wrought a great victory for all Israel: you saw it, and rejoiced; why then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As Yahweh lives, he will not be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as formerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And an evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said to him, Far from it; you will not die: look, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And David swore moreover, and said, Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, Don't let Jonathan know this, or else he will be grieved: but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David said to Jonathan, Look, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If your father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he says thus, It is well; your slave will have peace: but if he is angry, then know that evil has been determined by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Therefore deal kindly with your slave; for you have brought your slave into a covenant of Yahweh with you: but if there is iniquity in me, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would not I tell it you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then said David to Jonathan, Who will tell me if perchance your father answers you roughly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said to David, [By] Yahweh, God of Israel: surely I will sound out my father by about this time on the third day, look, if there is good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And you will not only while I yet live show me the loving-kindness of Yahweh, that I will not die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>but also you will not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], And Yahweh will require it at the hand of the sons of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And on the third day, you will go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when the business was in hand, and will remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And, look, I will send the lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I say to the lad, Look, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say thus to the boy, Look, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And as concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, look, Yahweh is between you and me forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon came, the king sat him down to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it came to pass on the next day, the second of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why didn't the son of Jesse come to meat, neither yesterday, nor today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>and he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he didn't come to the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the ground, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now send and fetch him to me, for he will surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast his spear at him to strike him; therefore Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Isn't the arrow beyond you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, hurry, don't stop. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad didn't know anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose from beside the mound, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, since we have sworn both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today will their vessels be holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the slaves of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business was urgent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, look, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other but that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the slaves of Achish said to him, Isn't this David the king of the land? Didn't they sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself insane in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; then he stopped to go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And David remained in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>And David saw that Saul came out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.17'>And he said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father will not find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.18'>And they both made a covenant before Yahweh: and David remained in the forest, and Jonathan went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.19'>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.20'>Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.21'>And Saul said, Blessed be you{+} of Yahweh; for you{+} have had compassion on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.22'>Go, I pray you{+}, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where [the trace of] his foot is, [and] who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.23'>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come{+} again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you{+}: and it will come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.24'>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.25'>And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: therefore he came down to the rock, and remained in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.26'>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.27'>But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Hurry, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.28'>So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.29'>And David went up from there, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.1'>And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Look, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were dwelling in the innermost parts of the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>And the men of David said to him, Look, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Look, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you will do to him as it will seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.10'>Look, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but [I] spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn't kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I haven't sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.12'>Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.1'>And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding and beautiful: but the man was harsh and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go{+} up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>and thus you{+} will say to him, To life! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>And now I have heard that you have shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did not hurt them, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask your young men, and they will tell you: therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatever comes to your hand, to your slaves, and to your son David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.10'>And Nabal answered David's slaves, and said, Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many slaves nowadays that break away every man from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I don't know from where they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said to his men, Gird{+} on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred remained by the baggage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Look, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he railed at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither did we miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.16'>they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them shepherding the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one can't speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>Then Abigail hurried, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five seahs of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said to her young men, Go on before me; look, I come after you{+}. But she didn't tell her husband Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>And it was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, look, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>Now David had said, Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has returned me evil for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.22'>God do so to David, and more also, if I leave of all who pertain to him by the morning light so much as one urinating against a wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.23'>And when Abigail saw David, she hurried, and dismounted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>And she fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and let your slave, I pray you, speak in your ears, and you hear the words of your slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Don't let my lord, I pray you, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your slave didn't see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, seeing Yahweh has withheld you from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now this present which your slave has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>Forgive, I pray you, the trespass of your slave: for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil will not be found in you all your days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>And though man rises up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies, he will sling them out, as from the hollow of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And it will come to pass, when Yahweh will have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and will have appointed you leader over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Yahweh will have dealt well with my lord, then remember your slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one urinating against a wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, look, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry inside him, for he was very drunk: therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died inside him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>And it came to pass about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his slave from evil: and the evildoing of Nabal Yahweh has returned on his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>And when the slaves of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Look, your slave is a slave to wash the feet of my lord's slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.44'>Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.26'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David remained in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul came of a certainty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay inside the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, look, Saul lay sleeping inside the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I pray you, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>And David said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be innocent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>And David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day will come to die; or he will go down into battle and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed: but now take, I pray you, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they got away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh had fallen on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain far off; a great space being between them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Don't you answer, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cried to the king?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>This thing is not good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you{+} are worthy to die, because you{+} haven't kept watch over your{+} lord, Yahweh's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.2'>And David said to Achish, Therefore you will know what your slave will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you keeper of my head forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.3'>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away the spiritists and the wizards out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.4'>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.5'>And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.6'>And when Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh did not answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.7'>Then Saul said to his slaves, Seek me a woman who is mistress of a spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his slaves said to him, Look, there is a woman at En-dor who is mistress of a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.8'>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Tell my fortune, I pray you, with a spirit, and call up for me whomever I will name to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And the woman said to him, Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the spiritists and the wizards out of the land: why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives, no punishment will happen to you for this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said to her, Don't be afraid: for what did you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and has not answered me anymore, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>And Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh has departed from you, and has become your adversary?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And Yahweh has done for himself, as he spoke by me: and Yahweh has rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your fellow man, even to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and did not execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this thing to you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: Yahweh will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was very afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, Look, your female slave has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore, I pray you, you listen also to the voice of your female slave, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his slaves, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>and she brought it before Saul, and before his slaves; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>Then the princes of the Philistines said, What [are] these Hebrews [doing here]? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Isn't this David, the slave of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather] these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away [to me] to this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for how should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Isn't this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I haven't found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords don't favor you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you do not displease the lords of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your slave so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He will not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Therefore, rise up early in the morning with the slaves of your lord that came with you, and go to the town that I gave you{+}. And don't take the complaint to heart, because you are good in my sight. And as soon as you{+} are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>And it came to pass, when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>and had taken captive the women who were in it, both small and great: they did not slay any, but carried them off, and went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>And when David and his men came to the city, look, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray you, bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod there to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for you will surely overtake [them], and without fail will recover [all].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind had stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stopped, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drank any water, three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said to him, To whom do you belong? And where are you from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, slave to an Amalekite; and this is now the third day since my master left me because I was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And when he had brought him down, look, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had left at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him: and when David came near to the people, he greeted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, Because they didn't go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his sons, that he may lead them away, and depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>Then said David, You{+} will not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>And who will listen to you{+} in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so will his share be that tarries by the baggage: they will share alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his fellow man, saying, Look, a present for you{+} of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>To those who were in Bethuel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>and to those who were in Arad, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to roam.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>And the Philistines stuck [closely] on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>And the battle went intensely against Saul, and the archers, men with the bow, overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Then Saul said to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, or else these uncircumcised will come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men too, that same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the good news to the house of their idols, and to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</verse>
