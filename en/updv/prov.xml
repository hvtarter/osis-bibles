      <chapter osisID='Prov.1'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they will be a chaplet of grace to your head, And chains about your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, Let us lay in wait for blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those who go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We will find all precious substance; We will fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>You will cast your lot among us; We will all have one bag:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, don't walk in the way with them; Refrain your foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; It takes away the life of its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries aloud in the street; She utters her voice in the broad places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She cries in the most noisy places; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, you{+} simple ones, will you{+} love simplicity? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn{+} at my reproof: Look, I will cause my spirit to gush out on you{+} I will make my words known to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you{+} have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But you{+} have set at nothing all my counsel, And would have none of my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh in [the day of] your{+} calamity; I will mock when your{+} fear comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your{+} fear comes as a storm, And your{+} calamity comes on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They didn't want my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the backsliding of the simple will slay them, And the careless ease of fools will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever harkens to me will stay securely, And will be quiet without fear of evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words, And lay up my commandments with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So as to incline your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yes, if you cry after discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, And find knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For Yahweh gives wisdom; Out of his mouth [comes] knowledge and understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to those who walk in integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you will understand righteousness and justice, And equity, [yes], every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom will enter into your heart, And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion will watch over you; Understanding will keep you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver you from the way of evil, From the men who speak perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver you from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>That forsakes the best friend of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house inclines to death, And her paths to the spirits of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None who go to her return again, Neither do they attain to the paths of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That you may walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright will stay in the land, And the perfect will be left in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked will be cut off from the land, And betrayers will be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, do not forget my law; But let your heart keep my commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days, and years of life, And peace, they will add to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Don't let kindness and truth forsake you: Bind them about your neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So you will find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him, And he will direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Don't be wise in your own eyes; Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be health to your navel, And marrow to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor Yahweh with your substance, And with the first fruits of all your increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So your barns will be filled with corn, And your vats will overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, don't despise the chastening of Yahweh; Neither be weary of his reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom Yahweh loves he reproves; Even as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is [the] man who finds wisdom, And [the] man who gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And its profit than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold on her: And happy is everyone who retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>So they will be life to your soul, And grace to your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then you will walk in your way securely, And your foot will not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you will not be afraid: Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Don't be afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For Yahweh will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Don't withhold good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Don't say to your fellow man, Go, and come again, And tomorrow I will give; When you have it by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Don't devise evil against your fellow man Who dwells securely by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Don't strive with man without cause, If he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Don't envy the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse is disgusting to Yahweh; But his friendship is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked; But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely he scoffs at the scoffers; But he gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise will inherit glory; But shame will be the promotion of fools.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.4'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Hear, [my] sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you{+} good doctrine; Don't forsake{+} my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was a son to my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>And he taught me, and said to me: Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.5'>Get wisdom, get understanding; Don't forget, neither decline from the words of my mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.6'>Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.7'>Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom; Yes, with all your getting get understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.8'>Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.9'>She will give to your head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty she will deliver to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of your life will be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.12'>When you go, your steps will not be straitened; And if you run, you will not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.13'>Take fast hold of instruction; don't let her go: Keep her; for she is your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.14'>Don't enter into the path of the wicked, And don't walk in the way of evil men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it, don't pass by it; Turn from it, and pass on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they don't sleep, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shines more and more to the perfect day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is as darkness: They don't know at what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, attend to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.22'>For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.23'>Keep your heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.24'>Put away from you a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.25'>Let your eyes look right on, And let your eyelids look straight before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.26'>Make level the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.27'>Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left: Remove your foot from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.5'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, attend to my wisdom; Incline your ear to my understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>That you may preserve discretion, And that your lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>If she does not find the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she will not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And do not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove your way far from her, And don't come near the door of her house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>Or else you will give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>Or else strangers will be filled with your strength, And your labors [be] in the house of an alien,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>And you mourn at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>And say, How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was well-near in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of your own cistern, And running waters out of your own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Should your springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.17'>Let them be for yourself alone, And not for strangers with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.18'>Let your fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of your youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.19'>[As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her nipples immerse you at all times; And be ravished always with her love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.20'>For why should you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh; And he makes level all his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>His own iniquities will take the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.23'>He will die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.6'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.1'>My son, if you have become surety for your fellow man, If you have stricken your hands for a stranger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.2'>You are snared with the words of your mouth, You are taken with the words of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.3'>Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, Seeing you have come into the hand of your fellow man: Go, humble yourself, and importune your fellow man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.4'>Don't give sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.5'>Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.6'>Go to the ant, you sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.7'>Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.10'>[Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.11'>So will your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>[A] worthless man, a man of iniquity, Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>That winks with his eyes, that speaks with his feet, That makes signs with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>In whose heart is perverseness, Who devises evil continually, Who sows discord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>Therefore will his calamity come suddenly; All of a sudden he will be broken, and that without remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>There are six things which Yahweh hates; Yes, seven which are disgusting to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>A heart that devises wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>A false witness that utters lies, And he who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.20'>My son, keep the commandment of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.30.17'>The eye that mocks at his father, And despises to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.18'>There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yes, four which I don't know:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.19'>The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent on a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a [noble] man with a young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.20'>So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eats, and wipes her mouth, And says, I have done no wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.21'>For three things the earth trembles, And for four, [which] it can't bear:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.30.29'>There are three things which are stately in their march, Yes, four which are stately in going:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.30'>The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And does not turn away for any;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.31'>The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.32'>If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, Or if you have thought evil, [Lay] your hand on your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.30.33'>For the churning of milk brings forth butter, And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; So the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</verse>
