  <div osisID='1Thess' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you{+} and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for all of you{+}, making mention [of you{+}] in our prayers without ceasing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering your{+} work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brothers beloved by God, your{+} election,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>how that our good news did not come to you{+} in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as you{+} know what manner of men we showed ourselves among you{+} for your{+} sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you{+} became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you{+} became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you{+} has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your{+} faith toward God has gone forth; so that we don't need to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had to you{+}; and how you{+} turned to God from idols, to serve as slaves to a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brothers, know our entering in to you{+}, that it has not been found vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you{+} know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak to you{+} the good news of God in much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation [is] not of error, nor of impurity, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but even as we have been approved of God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proves our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time did we come in words of flattery, as you{+} know, nor in a cloak of greed, God is witness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory of men, neither from you{+} nor from others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>We could have been a burden as apostles of Christ. But we became juveniles among you{+}, as when a nurse cherishes her own children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>even so, being affectionately desirous of you{+}, we were well pleased to impart to you{+}, not the good news of God only, but also our own souls, because you{+} became very dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you{+} remember, brothers, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you{+}, we preached to you{+} the good news of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You{+} are witnesses, and God [also], how holily and righteously and unblamably we became toward you{+} who believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>as you{+} know how we [dealt with] each one of you{+}, as a father with his own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>exhorting you{+}, and encouraging, and testifying, to the end that you{+} should walk worthily of God, who calls you{+} into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you{+} received from us the word of the message, [even the word] of God, you{+} accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you{+} who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you{+}, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for you{+} also suffered the same things of your{+} own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and did not please God, and are contrary to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you{+} for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your{+} face with great desire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>because we wanted to come to you{+}, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you{+}, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you{+} are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and coworker under God in the good news of Christ, to establish you{+}, and to comfort [you{+}] concerning your{+} faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For truly, when we were with you{+}, we told you{+} beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and you{+} know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your{+} faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you{+}, and our labor should be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But when Timothy came even now to us from you{+}, and brought us good news about your{+} faith and love, and that you{+} have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also [to see] you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you{+} in all our distress and affliction through your{+} faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>for now we live, if you{+} stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you{+}, for all the joy with which we joy for your{+} sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your{+} face, and may provide that which is lacking in your{+} faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and the Lord make you{+} to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also [do] toward you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>to the end he may establish your{+} hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brothers, we urge and exhort you{+} in the Lord Jesus, that, as you{+} received of us how you{+} ought to walk and to please God, even as you{+} do walk, --that you{+} abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you{+} know what charge we gave you{+} through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, [even] your{+} sanctification, that you{+} abstain from fornication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you{+} know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not by immoral sexual passion, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no man transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you{+} and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God called us not for impurity, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who rejects, rejects not man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning love of the brothers you{+} have no need that one write to you{+}: for you{+} yourselves are taught of God to love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for indeed you{+} do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you{+}, brothers, that you{+} abound more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that you{+} make it your aim to be quiet, and to participate in your{+} own [things], and to work with your{+} own hands, even as we charged you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you{+} may walk becomingly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But we would not have you{+} ignorant, brothers, concerning those who fall asleep; that you{+} do not sorrow, even as the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so those also that have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you{+} by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you{+} have no need that anything be written to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you{+}, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you{+} as a thief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>for you{+} are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep in the night: and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us into wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, that, whether we are awake or asleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also you{+} do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>But we urge you{+}, brothers, to know those who labor among you{+}, and are over you{+} in the Lord, and admonish you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them exceedingly highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And we exhort you{+}, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render to anyone evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, both one toward another, and toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>pray without ceasing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>do not despise prophesyings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>but prove all things; hold fast that which is good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And may the God of peace himself sanctify you{+} wholly; and may your{+} spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he who calls you{+}, who will also do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray also for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you{+} by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you{+}.</verse>
