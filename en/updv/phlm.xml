  <div osisID='Phlm' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and coworker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of your faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I had much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin you [to do] that which is befitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for love's sake I rather urge, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I urge you for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I have sent back to you in his own person, that is, my very heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I was hoping to keep with me, that in your behalf he might serve me in the bonds of the good news:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but without your mind I would do nothing; that your goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he was therefore parted [from you] for a season, that you should have him forever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you count me a partner, receive him as [you would] me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he has wronged you at all, or owes [you] anything, put that to my account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul write it with my own hand, I will repay it: that I should not have to say to you that you owe to me even your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But as well, also prepare a lodging for me: for I hope that through your{+} prayers I will be granted to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>[and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my coworkers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your{+} spirit.</verse>
