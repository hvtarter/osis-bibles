  <div osisID='Job' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting had gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from? Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Haven't you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance has increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, all that he has is in your power; only on him do not put forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys pasturing beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans fell [on them], and took them away: yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and, look, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I will return there: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin, nor charge God foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from? And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil: and he still holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, he is in your hand; only spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with intense boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with it; and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Renounce God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three companions heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes far off, and didn't know him, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born, And the night which said, A [noble] man was conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; Don't let God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud stay on it; Let all that makes blackness of day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it: Don't let it rejoice among the days of the year; Don't let it come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Look, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it see the eyelids of the morning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, Nor hid trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why didn't I die from the womb? Why didn't I give up the ghost when my mother bore me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should be nursed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I should have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together; They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there: And the slave is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter in soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, but it does not come, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a [noble] man whose way is hid, And whom God has hedged in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I fear comes on me, And that which I am afraid of comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble comes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one assay to commune with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Look, you have instructed many, And you have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have upheld him who was falling, And you have made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it has come to you, and you faint; It touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Isn't your fear [of God] your confidence, [And] the integrity of your ways your hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray you, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>According to as I have seen, those who plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Will common man be more just than God? Will [noble] man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Look, he puts no trust in his slaves; And his angels he charges with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more those who stay in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Between morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish forever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Isn't their tent-cord plucked up inside them? They die, and that without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now; is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation kills the foolish man, And jealousy slays the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His sons are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eats up, And takes it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapes for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction does not come forth from the dust, Neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me, I would seek to God, And to God I would commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who does great things and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>So that he sets up on high those who are low, And those who mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can't perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor has hope, And iniquity stops her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Look, happy is [the] common man whom God corrects: Therefore don't despise the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he makes sore, and binds up; He wounds, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver you in six troubles; Yes, in seven no evil will touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem you from death; And in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You will be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine you will laugh; Neither will you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you will be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And you will know that your tent is in peace; And you will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You will know also that your seed will be great, And your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You will come to your grave in a full age, Like a shock of grain comes in in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>See this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know it for your good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are inside me, The poison of which my spirit drinks up: The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which has no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuses to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>And be it still my consolation, Yes, let me exult in pain that does not spare, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him who is ready to faint kindness [should be shown] from his friend; Even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers have betrayed as a wadi, As a channel of wadis, they pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are black by reason of the ice, [And] in which the snow hides itself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came there, and were confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now you{+} are nothing; You{+} see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Give to me? Or, Offer a present for me of your{+} substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand in what I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are words of uprightness! But your{+} reproof, what does it reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do you{+} think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yes, you{+} would cast [lots] on the fatherless, And make merchandise of your{+} companion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be pleased to look at me; For surely I will not lie to your{+} face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you{+}, let there be no injustice; Yes, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue? Can't my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not a warfare to common man on earth? And are not his days like the days of a hired worker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a slave who earnestly desires the shadow, And as a hired worker that looks for his wages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.2'>Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.3'>Will he make many supplications to you? Or will he speak soft words to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.4'>Will he make a covenant with you, That you should take him for a slave forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.5'>Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your maidens?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.6'>Will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.7'>Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.8'>Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.9'>Look, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be overcome even at the sight of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.10'>None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.11'>Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? [Whatever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.12'>I will not keep silent concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.13'>Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come inside his jaws?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.14'>Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.15'>[His] strong scales are [his] back, Shut up together [as with] a close seal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.16'>One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.17'>They are stuck [as close as] a man to his brother; They join together, so that they can't be sundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, As of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>In his neck resides strength, And terror dances before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>The flakes of his flesh are stuck: They are firm on him; they can't be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>His heart is as firm as a stone; Yes, firm as the nether millstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.25'>When he raises himself up, the gods are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.26'>If one lays at him with the sword, it can't avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.27'>He counts iron as straw, [And] bronze as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow can't make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Clubs are counted as stubble: He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds: He spreads [as it were] a threshing-wain on the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He makes the deep to boil like a pot: He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He makes a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be gray-headed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.33'>On earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.34'>He beholds everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered Yahweh, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that you can do all things, And that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have uttered that which I didn't understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I urge you, and I will speak; I will demand of you, and declare you to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I abhor [myself], And repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that, after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two companions; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my slave Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my slave Job will pray for you{+}; for him I will accept, that I do not deal with you{+} after your{+} folly; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according to as Yahweh commanded them: and Yahweh accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his companions: and Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.</verse>
