      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus speaks Yahweh of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time [for us] to come, the time for Yahweh's house to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Is it a time for you{+} yourselves to dwell in your{+} ceiled houses, while this house lies waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: Consider your{+} ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>You{+} have sown much, and bring in little; you{+} eat, but you{+} don't have enough; you{+} drink, but you{+} are not filled with drink; you{+} clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he who earns wages, earns wages [to put it] into a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Consider your{+} ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>You{+} looked for much, and, look, it came to little; and when you{+} brought it home, I blew on it. Why? says Yahweh of hosts. Because of my house that lies waste, while you{+} run every man to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore above you{+} the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought on the land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on man, and on cattle, and on all the labor of the hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Yahweh their God had sent him; and the people feared before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then Haggai, Yahweh's messenger, spoke Yahweh's message to the people, saying, I am with you{+}, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth [month], in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh [month], in the one and twentieth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who is left among you{+} that saw this house in its former glory? And how do you{+} see it now? Is it not in your{+} eyes as nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Yahweh; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all you{+} people of the land, says Yahweh, and work: for I am with you{+}, says Yahweh of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>[according to] the word that I covenanted with you{+} when you{+} came out of Egypt, and my Spirit remained among you{+}: don't be{+} afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations will come; and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says Yahweh of hosts; and in this place I will give peace, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>If one bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then Haggai said, If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It will be unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says Yahweh; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now, I pray you{+}, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>how were you? When one came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I struck you{+} with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your{+} hands; yet you{+} did not [turn] to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Consider, I pray you{+}, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], since the day that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid, consider it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? And even the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day I will bless [you{+}].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And the word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them; and the horses and their riders will come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, my slave, the son of Shealtiel, says Yahweh, and will make you as a signet; for I have chosen you, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
