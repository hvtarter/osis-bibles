      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah begot Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez begot Hezron; and Hezron begot Ram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram begot Amminadab; and Amminadab begot Nahshon; and Nahshon begot Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon begot Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz begot Obed from Ruth; and Obed begot Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon from the wife of Uriah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon begot Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begot Abijah; and Abijah begot Asaph;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asaph begot Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begot Joram; and Joram begot Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah begot Jotham; and Jotham begot Ahaz; and Ahaz begot Hezekiah;</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Herod, King of Judea, in the highpriesthood of Caiaphas, there came a certain man named John baptizing a baptism of repentance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>who was known as being from the kindred of Aaron the priest, son of Zacharias and Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And John had a garment of camel's hair, and a leather belt about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And he said, I indeed baptize you{+} in water to repentance: but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear: he will baptize you{+} in the Holy Spirit and [in] fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And Jesus when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water: and look, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>and look, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tried by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, say that these stones may become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>But he answered and said, It is written, Man will not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then the devil takes him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and says to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning you: and, On their hands they will bear you up, Lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You will not make trial of Yahweh your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Again, the devil takes him to an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and he said to him, All these things I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Then Jesus says to him, Go, Satan: for it is written, You will worship Yahweh your God, and you will serve only him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>Then the devil leaves him; and look, angels came and were serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent{+}; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And he says to them, Come{+} after me, and I will make you{+} fishers of men. And they immediately left the nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And they go into Capernaum; and right away on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as their scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>And right away there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits and healed all who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>And there came to him a leper. And he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And Jesus says to him, See you tell no man; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy, Child, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And look, certain of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why do you{+} think evil in your{+} hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--then he says to the sick of the palsy, Arise, and take up your bed, and go up to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And he arose, and departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.26'>But when the multitudes saw it, they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.27'>And as Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.28'>And it came to pass, as he sat to eat in the house, look, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.29'>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your{+} Teacher eat with the publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.30'>But when he heard it, he said, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.31'>Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.32'>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.33'>And no man puts a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; for that which should fill it up takes from the garment, and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.34'>Neither do [men] put new wine into old wineskins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>At that season Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Look, your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>But he said to them, Have you{+} not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>And he departed from there, and went into their synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>and look, a man having a withered hand. And they watched him to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day; so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>And he said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Then he says to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>And Jesus withdrew from there: and great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and [from] beyond the Jordan followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought to him all who were sick, held with diverse diseases and torments, and possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And he came down with them, and stood on a level place with a great multitude of his disciples and the people who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>Blessed [are] you{+} poor: for yours{+} is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>Blessed [are] you{+} who hunger now: for you{+} will be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Blessed [are] you{+} who weep now: for you{+} will laugh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Blessed are you{+}, when men will hate you{+}, and when they will separate you{+} [from their company],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Rejoice in that day, and leap [for joy]: for look, your{+} reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>But woe to you{+} who are rich! For you{+} have received your{+} consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>Woe to you{+}, you{+} who are full now! For you{+} will hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>Woe [to you{+}], you{+} who laugh now! For you{+} will mourn and weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>Woe [to you{+}], when all men will speak well of you{+}! For in the same manner their fathers did to the false prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But I say to you{+} who hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>Love your{+} enemies, do good to those who hate you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>bless those who curse you{+}, pray for those who despitefully use you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>To him who strikes you on the [one] cheek offer also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>and from him who takes away your cloak don't withhold your coat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>Give to everyone who asks you; and of him who takes away your goods don't ask [for them] back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>And as you{+} would that men should do to you{+}, do{+} to them likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>And if you{+} love those who love you{+}, what thanks do you{+} have? For even sinners love those who love them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>For even if you{+} do good to those who do good to you{+}, what thanks do you{+} have? Even sinners do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>And if you{+} lend to them of whom you{+} hope to receive, what thanks is it to you{+}? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>But love your{+} enemies, and do [them] good, and lend, never despairing; and your{+} reward will be great, and you{+} will be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Be{+} merciful, even as your{+} Father is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>And do not judge, and you{+} will not be judged: and do not condemn, and you{+} will not be condemned: release, and you{+} will be released:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>give, and it will be given to you{+}; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your{+} bosom. For with what measure you{+} mete it will be measured to you{+} again.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.7'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>And there came to him a captain, imploring him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>and saying, Lord, my [young] slave lies in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>And he says to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>And the captain answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; but only say the word, and my [young] slave will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you{+}, I have found no one with such faith in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>And Jesus said to the captain, Go your way; as you have believed, [so] be it done to you. And his [young] slave was healed in that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent through his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>and said to him, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you{+} hear and see:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>And blessed is he, whoever will find no occasion of stumbling in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you{+} go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>But what did you{+} go out to see? A man clothed in soft [raiment]? Look, those who wear soft [raiment] are in kings' houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>But why did you{+} go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you{+}, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>This is he, of whom it is written, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>Truly I say to you{+}, Among those who are born of women there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet, he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>And she, being put forward by her mother, says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And being grieved, the king, because of his oaths and because of those who sat to eat with him, he commanded it to be given;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the girl: and she brought it to her mother.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>On that day Jesus went out of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And there were gathered to him great multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Look, the sower went forth to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>and others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth: and right away they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And others fell on the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>and others fell on the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>He who has ears, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>And the disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And he answered and said to them, To you{+} it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance: but whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Therefore I speak to them in parables; because seeing they don't see, and hearing they don't hear, neither do they understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Then hear{+} the parable of the sower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, [then] the evil [one] comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown by the wayside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And he who was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and right away with joy receives it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>yet he does not have root in himself, but endures for awhile; and when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away he stumbles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And he who was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the care of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And he who was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it; who truly bears fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>He set another parable before the multitudes, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds also among the wheat, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the weeds also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? From where then has it weeds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And he said to them, A hostile man has done this. And the slaves say to him, Will you then that we go and gather them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>But he says, No; lest perhaps while you{+} gather up the weeds, you{+} root up the wheat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>Another parable he set before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable he spoke nothing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And he answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil [one];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the very end of the age; and the reapers are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.35'>As therefore the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so it will be in the very end of the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.36'>The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.37'>and will cast them into the furnace of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.38'>Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he gave commandment to depart to the other side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And when he came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him a man possessed with demons coming forth out of the tombs who was so strong that no man could bind him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And Jesus asked him, What is your name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine being shepherded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>And they implored him, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and look, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And those who shepherded them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to him who was possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>And look, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they implored [him] that he would depart from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>And he entered into a boat, and crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>And there came a ruler, and fell at his feet, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: come and lay your hands on her, and she will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And look, a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said to herself, If I do but touch his garment, I will be made whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said, Do not weep; for the girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the girl arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the news of this went forth into all that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.1'>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.4'>And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.15'>and he was transfigured before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.16'>And look, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.17'>And Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will, I will make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.20'>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, except when the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.22'>And they asked him, saying, [How is it] that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.23'>And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.24'>But I say to you{+}, that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they would, even as it is written of him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.19'>Now when evening came, he was sitting at meat with the twelve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.20'>and as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you{+}, that one of you{+} will deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.21'>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began to say to him each one, Is it I, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.22'>And he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.23'>The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! Good were it for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.24'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.25'>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.26'>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.27'>But I say to you{+}, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you{+} in my Father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.28'>Then came to him the sons of Zebedee, asking a certain thing of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.29'>And he said to them, What do you{+} want? They say to him, Say that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.30'>But Jesus answered and said, You{+} don't know what you{+} ask. Are you{+} able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.31'>He says to them, My cup indeed you{+} will drink: but to sit at my right hand, and on [my] left hand, this is not mine to give; but [it is for those] for whom it has been prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.32'>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.33'>But Jesus called them to him, and said, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and those who have authority over them are called Benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.34'>But you{+} [will] not [be] so: but he who is the greater among you{+}, let him become as the younger; and he who is chief, as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.35'>For which is greater, he who sits at meat, or he who serves? Isn't it he who sits at meat? But I am among you{+} as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.36'>But you{+} are those who have continued with me in my trials;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.37'>and I appoint to you{+}, even as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.38'>that you{+} may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you{+} will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.39'>Then Jesus says to them, All you{+} will be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.40'>But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended in you, I will never be offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.41'>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.42'>Peter says to him, Even if I must die with you, [yet] I will not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Sit{+} here, while I go yonder and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then he says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death: stay{+} here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, What, could you{+} not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Watch and pray, that you{+} don't enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>Then he comes to the disciples, and says to them, Are you{+} still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>Arise, let us be going: look, he is at hand that delivers me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>And while he yet spoke, look, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Now he that delivered him up gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he: take him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>And right away he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And look, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Jesus says to him, Return your sword to its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>Then Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you{+} come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you{+} did not take me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>But all this has come to pass, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And those who had taken Jesus led him away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>But Peter followed him from far off, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the attendants, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>and they did not find it, though many false witnesses came. But afterward, two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>who said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And the high priest stood up, and said to him, Do you answer nothing? What is it which these witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him, Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Jesus said to him, You have said. And you{+} will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He has spoken blasphemy: what further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you{+} have heard the blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>What do you{+} think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>Then they spat in his face and buffeted him. And some struck him with the palms of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is he that struck you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court: and a female slave came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But he denied before them all, saying, I don't know what you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>And when he had gone out into the porch, another [female slave] saw him, and she says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>And again he denied with an oath, I don't know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth you also are [one] of them; for your speech makes you known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>Then he began to curse and to swear, I don't know the man. And right away the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Now Jesus was standing before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, You say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Then Pilate says to him, Don't you hear how many things they witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marveled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>Now at the feast the governor would usually release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you{+} want that I release to you{+}? Barabbas or Jesus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>And they said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus? They all say, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>And they platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head; and they knelt down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: they compelled him to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>And they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>And they offered him wine mingled with gall: but he did not receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>and they sat and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then there are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>And those who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>and saying, You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days: save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>He saved others; himself he can't save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>He trusts on God; let him deliver [him] now, if he desires him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And the robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And the rest said, Let [him] be; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And look, the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>Now the captain who was watching Jesus, when he saw what happened, said, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>And many women were there watching from far, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>And when evening came, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting across from the tomb.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now late on the Sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And look, an angel appeared. His appearance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>And the angel said to the women, Don't be{+} afraid; for I know that you{+} seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear, and fled.</verse>
