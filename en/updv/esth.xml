      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his slaves; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even 180 days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains: therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law and judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it will be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>And this day the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen will say [the like] to all the king's princes. So [there will arise] much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it pleases the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, that Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to her fellow woman who is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And when the king's decree which he will make will be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then the king's attendants that ministered to him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>and let the maiden that pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden had a beautiful body and face; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden was good in his eyes, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king's house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>then in this wise the maiden came to the king: whatever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his slaves, even Esther's feast; and he ordered a rest to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like when she was brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it to Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [of it] in Mordecai's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's slaves, who were in the king's gate, bowed down to, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down, nor reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king's slaves, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king's commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down, nor reverence him, then Haman was full of wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>But it was contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people; neither do they keep the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it pleases the king, let it be written that they are to be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the [king's] business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then the king's scribes were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people after their language; in the name of King Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The posts went forth in a hurry by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>and he came even before the king's gate: for none might enter inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it to her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he did not receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend on her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai [saying]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the king's slaves, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, will come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he is to be put to death, except those to whom the king will hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I haven't been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai bade them return answer to Esther, Don't think within yourself that you will escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish: and who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther bade them return answer to Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast{+} for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house: and the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his eyes; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then the king said to her, What do you want, queen Esther? And what is your request? It will be given to you even to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then the king said, Cause Haman to hurry, that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? And it will be granted to you: and what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it will be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then Esther answered, and said, My petition and my request is:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and slaves of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but me; and also tomorrow I am invited by her together with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night the king could not sleep; and he commanded to bring the Book of Records of the Chronicles, and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those who kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then the king's attendants that ministered to him said, Nothing has been done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman came into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>And the king's attendants said to him, Look, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What will be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>And Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a royal crown is set:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with them whom the king delights to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus it will be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then the king said to Haman, Hurry, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus it will be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>While they were yet talking with him, the king's chamberlains came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? And it will be granted you: and what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it will be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my request:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male slaves and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>Then King Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart to do so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine [and went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>Then Harbonah said, one of the chamberlains that was before the king, Look also at the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman the Jews' enemy to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>And she said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>for how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Look, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>You{+} write also to the Jews, as it pleases you{+}, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] of it; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>And he wrote the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>in which the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, [their] little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, [namely], on the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>So the posts that rode on swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hurried and pressed on by the king's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews had fallen on them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them, (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over those who hated them,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and those who did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>And the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would to those who hated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, they slew; but on the spoil they didn't lay their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>On that day the number of those who were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? And it will be granted you: or what is your request further? And it will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>Then said Esther, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And the king commanded it to be done so: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they didn't lay their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>And the other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of those who hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they didn't lay their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>[This was done] on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] of it, and on the fourteenth of it; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>but when [the matter] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>the Jews appointed, and took on them, and on their seed, and on all such as joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to its writing, and according to its appointed time, every year;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according to as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had appointed for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fasts and their cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And the king Ahasuerus laid a tax on the land, and on the isles of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</verse>
