      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ [who are] at Colossae: Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard of your{+} faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you{+} have toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope which is laid up for you{+} in the heavens, of which you{+} heard before in the word of the truth of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which has come to you{+}; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as [it does] in you{+} also, since the day you{+} heard and knew the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>even as you{+} learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your{+} behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also declared to us your{+} love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray and make request for you{+}, that you{+} may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father, who made you{+} meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>for in him were all things created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For it was the good pleasure [of the Father] that in him should all the fullness dwell;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you{+}, being in time past alienated and enemies in your{+} mind in your{+} evil works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you{+} holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if indeed you{+} continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news which you{+} heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was made a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your{+} sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I was made a servant, according to the dispensation of God which was given me toward you{+}, to fulfill the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>[even] the mystery which has been hid since the ages and since the generations: but now it has been manifested to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you{+}, the hope of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>to which I labor also, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I would have you{+} know how greatly I strive for you{+}, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, [even] Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>This I say, that no one may delude you{+} with persuasiveness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you{+} in the spirit, joying and seeing your{+} order, and the steadfastness of your{+} faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As therefore you{+} received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him, and established in your{+} faith, even as you{+} were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Take heed lest there will be anyone who makes spoil of you{+} through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>for in him dwells all the fullness of Deity bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and in him you{+} are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>in whom you{+} were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you{+} were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you{+}, being dead in your{+} trespasses and the uncircumcision of your{+} flesh, you{+}, he made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he has taken it out from between [him and us], nailing it to the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no man therefore judge you{+} in meat and in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no man rob you{+} of your{+} prize by a voluntary humility and worshiping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has seen, puffed up for nothing by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increasing with the increase of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you{+} died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you{+} subject yourselves to ordinances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>Which things indeed have a show of wisdom in do-it-yourself religion, and humility, and severity to the body; [but are] not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you{+} were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your{+} mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you{+} died, and your{+} life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ will be manifested, [who is] your{+} life, then you{+} will also be manifested with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death therefore your{+} members which are on the earth: fornication, impurity, immoral sexual passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which you{+} also once walked, when you{+} lived in these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>but now do you{+} also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your{+} mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>do not lie one to another; seeing that you{+} have put off the old man with his activities,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed to knowledge after the image of him who created him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all things, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you{+}, so also [should] you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>and above all these things [put on] love, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of Christ rule in your{+} hearts, to the which you{+} also were called in one body; and be{+} thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you{+} richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms [and] hymns [and] spiritual songs, singing with grace in your{+} hearts to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you{+} do, in word or in deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be in subjection to your{+} husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your{+} wives, and do not be bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your{+} parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your{+} children, that they not be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Slaves, obey in all things those who are your{+} masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>whatever you{+} do, work heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from the Lord you{+} will receive the recompense of the inheritance: you{+} serve as slaves to the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>For he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done: and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, render to your{+} slaves that which is just and equal; knowing that you{+} also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>as well praying for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your{+} speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you{+} may know how you{+} ought to answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All my affairs Tychicus will make known to you{+}, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>whom I have sent you{+} for this very purpose, that you{+} may know our state, and that he may comfort your{+} hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you{+}. They will make known to you{+} all things that [are done] here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you{+}, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you{+} received commandments; if he comes to you{+}, receive him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these [are my] only coworkers to the kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of you{+}, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you{+}, always striving for you{+} in his prayers, that you{+} may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I bear him witness, that he has much labor for you{+}, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when this letter has been read among you{+}, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you{+} also read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the service which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation of me Paul with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you{+}.</verse>
