        <verse osisID='Song.1.2'>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For your love is better than wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>Your oils have a goodly fragrance; Your name is oil poured forth; Therefore the young women love you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.4'>Draw me; we will run after you: The king has brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in you; We will make mention of your love more than of wine: Rightly they love you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>I am black, but comely, Oh you{+} daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Don't look on me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; [But] my own vineyard I have not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where you shepherd [your flock], Where you make [it] to rest at noon: For why should I be as one who is veiled Beside the flocks of your fellow shepherds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If you don't know, O you most beautiful among women, Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And shepherd your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.9'>I have compared you, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.10'>Your cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], Your neck with strings of jewels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.8'>The voice of my beloved! Look, he comes, Leaping on the mountains, Skipping on the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Look, he stands behind our wall; He looks in at the windows; He glances through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For, look, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.12'>The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing [of birds] has come, And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>The fig-tree ripens her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved is mine, and I am his: He shepherds [his flock] among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart On the mountains of Bether.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.2'>[I said], I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen who go about the city found me; [To whom I said], Did you{+} see him whom my soul loves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>It was but a little while that I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of her who became pregnant with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you{+} do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>All of them handle the sword, [and] are expert in war: Every man has his sword on his thigh, Because of fear in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made its pillars of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, The midst of it being paved with love, From the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O you{+} daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon, With the crown with which his mother has crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Look, you are beautiful, my love; look, you are beautiful; Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Your teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn, Which have come up from the washing, Of which everyone has twins, And none is bereaved among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, And your mouth is comely. Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind your veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Your neck is like the tower of David Built for an armory, On which hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.5'>Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>You have ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride; You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, With one chain of your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How fair is your love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your oils than all manner of spices!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Your lips, O [my] bride, drop [as] the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under your tongue; And the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.15'>[You are] a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.16'>Awake, O north wind; and come, you south; Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I have come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk. Eat, O companions; Drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I was asleep, but my heart awoke: It is the voice of my beloved that knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen who go about the city found me, They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you{+} find my beloved, That you{+} tell him, that I am sick from love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, O you most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, That you so adjure us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.10'>My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.11'>His head is the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.12'>His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands are rings of gold set with beryl: His insides are ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.16'>His mouth is most sweet; Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my companion, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.2'>My beloved has gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To shepherd in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.3'>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; He shepherds [his flock] among the lilies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.4'>You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.5'>Turn away your eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Your hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.8'>There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, And young women without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove, my undefiled, is [but] one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; [Yes], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is she who looks forth as the morning, Beautiful as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, [And] the pomegranates were in flower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Before I was aware, my soul set me [Among] the chariots of my princely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look at you. Why will you{+} look at the Shulammite, As on the dance of Mahanaim?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skillful workman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Your body is [like] a round goblet, [In which] no mingled wine is wanting: Your waist is [like] a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Your neck is like the tower of ivory; Your eyes [as] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Your head on you is like Carmel, And the hair of your head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses [of it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.6'>How fair and how pleasant are you, [O] love, daughter of delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>Your stature is like a palm-tree, And your breasts to its clusters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of its branches: Let your breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of your breath like apples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>And your mouth like the best wine, That goes down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloved's; And his desire is toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded, [And] its blossom is open, [And] the pomegranates are in flower: There I will give you my love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>Oh that you were as my brother, That nursed the breasts of my mother! [When] I should find you outside, I would kiss you; Yes, and none would despise me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead you, [and] bring you into my mother's house, Who would instruct me; I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.8.4'>I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, That you{+} do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.5'>Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, Leaning on her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened you: There your mother was in travail with you, There she who brought you forth was in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal on your heart, As a seal on your arm: For love is as strong as death; Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; The flashes of it are flashes of fire, An intense flame of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters can't quench love, Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would be completely despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, And she has no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she will be spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she is a wall, We will build on her a turret of silver: And if she is a door, We will enclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.10'>I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers [of it]: Then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.11'>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one for its fruit was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.12'>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: You, O Solomon, will have the thousand, And those who keep its fruit two hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.13'>You who dwell in the gardens, My fellow shepherds listen for your voice: Cause me to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.14'>Hurry, my beloved, And be like a roe or to a young hart On the mountains of spices.</verse>
