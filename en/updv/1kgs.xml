  <div osisID='1Kgs' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his slaves said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a beautiful damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn't have any sex with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? And he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and those following Adonijah helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's slaves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and get in to King David, and say to him, Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your slave, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Look, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do you want?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your slave, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, look, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, do not know it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon your slave he has not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king will sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And, look, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Look, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, look, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, [Long] live King Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, even me your slave, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your slave Solomon, he has not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your slave who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then King David answered and said, Call to me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>truly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne in my stead; truly so I will do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said to them, Take with you{+} the slaves of your{+} lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow{+} the trumpet, and say, [Long] live King Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then you{+} will come up after him, and he will come and sit on my throne; for he will be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, says so [too].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so he will be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, [Long] live King Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he yet spoke, look, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord King David has made Solomon king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you{+} have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king's slaves came to bless our lord King David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne: and the king bowed himself on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Look, Adonijah fears King Solomon; for, look, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his slave with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, not a hair of him will fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I am going the way of all the earth: be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there will not fail you (he said) a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his belt that was about his loins, and in his sandals that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, look, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore don't hold him innocent, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you will bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three years he reigned in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have something to say to you. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: nevertheless the kingdom has turned about, and has become my brother's; for it was his from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me. And she said to him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray you, to Solomon the king (for he will not say no to you), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Good; I will speak for you to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; and [you ask] for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah will be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Sovereign Yahweh before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn't turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told King Solomon, Joab had fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and, look, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What was [wrong] with you that you fled to the altar? And Joab said, Because I was afraid of you, I fled to Yahweh. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it, [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>So will their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever: but to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there will be peace forever from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don't go forth from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know you for certain that you will surely die: your blood will be on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your slave do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the slaves of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Look, your slaves are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; and Shimei went, and brought his slaves from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and came again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad anywhere, you will surely die? And you said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then haven't you kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have charged you with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore Yahweh will return your wickedness on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But King Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before Yahweh forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, You have shown to your slave David my father great loving-kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great loving-kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O Yahweh my God, you have made your slave king instead of David my father: and I am but a small lad; I don't know how to go out or come in.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.2'>And the house which King Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was threescore cubits, and its width twenty [cubits], and its height thirty cubits.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.5'>And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.6'>The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house round about, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.7'>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.8'>The entrance for the middle story was on the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.9'>So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.10'>And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.11'>And the word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.12'>Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.14'>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.28'>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.31'>And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.32'>So [he made] two doors of olive-wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.33'>So also he made for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.36'>And he built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.37'>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of Yahweh was laid, in the month Ziv.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.29'>and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.30'>And every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of bronze; and the four feet of it had undersetters: beneath the basin the undersetters were molten, with wreaths at the side of each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.31'>And the mouth of it inside the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.32'>And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.33'>And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.34'>And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: its undersetters were of the base itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.35'>And in the top of the base there was a round circle half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its supports and its panels were of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.36'>And on the plates of its supports, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.37'>After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.38'>And he made ten basins of bronze: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.39'>And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.40'>And Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for King Solomon in the house of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.41'>the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.43'>and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.44'>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.45'>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.46'>The king had cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.47'>And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceedingly many: the weight of the bronze could not be found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.48'>And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table on which the showbread was, of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.49'>and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.50'>and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.51'>Thus all the work that King Solomon wrought in the house of Yahweh was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.11'>And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.12'>And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.13'>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her slaves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.16'>And King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.17'>And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.18'>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.19'>There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.20'>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.21'>And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver: it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.22'>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.23'>So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.24'>And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.26'>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king's merchants acquired those from Kue for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.29'>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they would bring them out by their means.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.1'>Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.11'>And now whereas my father laded you{+} with a heavy yoke, I will add to your{+} yoke: my father chastised you{+} with whips, but I will chastise you{+} with scorpions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.1'>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.2'>And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And the famine was intense in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.3'>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.4'>for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.5'>And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the fountains of water, and to all the brooks: perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we do not lose all the beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.6'>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.7'>And as Obadiah was in the way, look, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.8'>And he answered him, It is I: go, tell your lord, Look, Elijah [is here].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.9'>And he said, In what have I sinned, that you would deliver your slave into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.10'>As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn't find you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.11'>And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Look, Elijah [is here].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.12'>And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, I don't know where the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will slay me: but I your slave have feared Yahweh from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>Wasn't it told to my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid a hundred men of Yahweh's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Look, Elijah [is here]; and he will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.15'>And Elijah said, As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>And Elijah came near to all the people, and said, How long do you{+} go limping between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>And you{+} call on the name of your{+} god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh; and the God who answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.25'>And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose{+} one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you{+} are many; and call on the name of your{+} god, but put no fire under.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>And they took the bull which was given to them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying, Israel will be your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your slave, and that I have done all these things at your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Hear me, O Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and [that] you have turned their heart back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Yahweh, he is God; Yahweh, he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don't let one of them escape. And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>And he said to his attendant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Look, there rises a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Make ready [your chariot], and go down, that the rain doesn't stop you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>and the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.4'>But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.5'>And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, look, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.11'>And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before Yahweh.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.4'>And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; otherwise, if it pleases you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, [and] that dwelt with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, You cursed God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according to as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth cursed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: look, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And you will speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? And you will speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth will dogs lick your blood, even yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Look, I will bring evil on you, and will completely sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab [every] one urinating against a wall, whether slave or free in Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezebel, Yahweh also spoke, saying, The dogs will eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>He who dies of Ahab in the city, the dogs will eat; and he who dies in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>(But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And what he did was very disgusting in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the sons of Israel.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Do you see how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the evil on his house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said to his slaves, Do you{+} know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray you, for the word of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Don't let the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these you will push the Syrians, until they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Look now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And Yahweh said, Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, I will entice him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And Yahweh said to him, How? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You will entice him, and will prevail also: go forth, and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore, look, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Look, you will see on that day, when you will go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, you{+} peoples, all of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it wasn't the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am critically wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle increased that day: and the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves [there]); according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And the remnant of the homosexuals, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they did not go; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my slaves go with your slaves in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>And he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked Yahweh to anger, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
