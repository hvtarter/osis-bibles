      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and bore witness to your truth, even as you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you do toward those who are brothers and strangers as well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who bore witness to your love before the church: whom you will do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be coworkers for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote somewhat to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, doesn't receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, talking foolishly against us with wicked words. And not content with this, he doesn't receive the brothers either, and he forbids and casts out of the church those who would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yes, we also bear witness: and you know that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write [them] to you with ink and pen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>but I hope shortly to see you, and we will speak face to face. [15] Peace [be] to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
