  <div osisID='Deut' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah across from Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You{+} have dwelt long enough in this mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>turn{+}, and take your{+} journey, and go{+} to the hill-country of the Amorites, and to all its neighboring places, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Look, I have set the land before you{+}: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your{+} fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke to you{+} at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you{+} myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>Yahweh your{+} God has multiplied you{+}, and see, you{+} are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, may he make you{+} a thousand times as many as you{+} are, and bless you{+}, as he has promised you{+}!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone bear your{+} cumbrance, and your{+} burden, and your{+} strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take yourselves wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your{+} tribes, and I will make them heads over you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And you{+} answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good [for us] to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your{+} tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you{+}, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your{+} tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your{+} judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your{+} brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>You{+} will not respect persons in judgment; you{+} will hear the small and the great alike; you{+} will not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you{+}, you{+} will bring to me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you{+} at that time all the things which you{+} should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you{+} saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said to you{+}, You{+} have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And you{+} came near to me every one of you{+}, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you{+}, one man for every tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Yet you{+} would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your{+} God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and you{+} murmured in your{+} tents, and said, Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and more numerous than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you{+}, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>Yahweh your{+} God who goes before you{+}, he will fight for you{+}, according to all that he did for you{+} in Egypt before your{+} eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you{+} went, until you{+} came to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing you{+} did not believe Yahweh your{+} God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went before you{+} in the way, to seek you{+} out a place to pitch your{+} tents in, in fire by night, to show you{+} by what way you{+} should go, and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And Yahweh heard the voice of your{+} words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely not a man of these men of this evil generation will see the good land, which I swore to give to your{+} fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he will see it; and to him I will give the land that he has trodden on, and to his sons, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also Yahweh was angry with me for your{+} sakes, saying, You also will not go in there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he will go in there: encourage him; for he will cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your{+} little ones, that you{+} said should be a prey, and your{+} sons, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go in there, and to them I will give it, and they will possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you{+}, you{+} turn, and take your{+} journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then you{+} answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. And you{+} girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And Yahweh said to me, Say to them, Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you{+}; lest you{+} be struck before your{+} enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you{+}, and you{+} didn't listen; but you{+} rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you{+}, and chased you{+}, as bees do, and beat you{+} down in Seir, even to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And you{+} returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your{+} voice, nor gave ear to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So you{+} remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you{+} remained [there].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>You{+} have compassed this mountain long enough: you{+} turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And you command the people, saying, You{+} are to pass through the border of your{+} brothers the sons of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you{+}: you{+} take good heed to yourselves therefore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>don't contend with them; for I will not give you{+} of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You{+} will purchase food of them for money, that you{+} may eat; and you{+} will also buy water of them for money, that you{+} may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>So we passed by from our brothers the sons of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And Yahweh said to me, Don't vex Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim dwelt in it previously, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites also dwelt in Seir previously, but the sons of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, and get yourselves over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>and when you come near across from the sons of Ammon, don't vex them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt in it previously; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did for the sons of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>You{+} rise up, take your{+} journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who will hear the report of you, and will tremble, and be in anguish because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You will sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the sons of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did to me; until I will pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And Yahweh said to me, Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and completely destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we completely destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, completely destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; look, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits the width of it, after the cubit of a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is on the gorge of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border [of it], and to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it], from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you{+} at that time, saying, Yahweh your{+} God has given you{+} this land to possess it: you{+} will pass over armed before your{+} brothers the sons of Israel, all the men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your{+} wives, and your{+} little ones, and your{+} cattle, (I know that you{+} have much cattle,) will remain in your{+} cities which I have given you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until Yahweh gives rest to your{+} brothers, as to you{+}, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your{+} God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you{+} will return every man to his possession, which I have given you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your{+} God has done to these two kings: so will Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>You{+} will not fear them; for Yahweh your{+} God, it is he who fights for you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I implored Yahweh at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Sovereign Yahweh, you have begun to show your slave your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Let me go over, I pray you, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But Yahweh was angry with me for your{+} sakes, and didn't listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Get up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and look at it with your eyes: for you will not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he will go over before this people, and he will cause them to inherit the land which you will see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we remained in the valley across from Beth-peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you{+}, to do them; that you{+} may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, gives you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You{+} will not add to the word which I command you{+}, neither will you{+} diminish from it, that you{+} may keep the commandments of Yahweh your{+} God which I command you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your{+} eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal-peor; for all the men who followed Baal-peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But you{+} who stuck to Yahweh your{+} God are alive every one of you{+} this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>Look, I have taught you{+} statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you{+} should do so in the midst of the land where you{+} go in to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your{+} wisdom and your{+} understanding in the sight of the peoples, that will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.7'>For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.8'>And what great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you{+} this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.9'>Only you be careful and keep your soul diligently, or else you will forget the things which your eyes saw, and they will depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and the sons of your sons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.10'>the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.11'>And you{+} came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.12'>And Yahweh spoke to you{+} out of the midst of the fire: you{+} heard the voice of words, but you{+} saw no form; [you{+} heard] only a voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.13'>And he declared to you{+} his covenant, which he commanded you{+} to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.14'>And Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you{+} statutes and ordinances, that you{+} might do them in the land where you{+} go over to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.15'>Therefore take{+} good heed to yourselves; for you{+} saw no manner of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you{+} in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.16'>Or else you{+} will corrupt yourselves, and make you{+} a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.17'>the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.18'>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.19'>Or else you will lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, you will be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.20'>But Yahweh has taken you{+}, and brought you{+} forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.21'>Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your{+} sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.22'>but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you{+} will go over, and possess that good land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.23'>Take heed to yourselves, or else you{+} will forget the covenant of Yahweh your{+} God, which he made with you{+}, and make a graven image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.24'>For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.25'>When you will beget sons, and sons of sons, and you{+} will have been long in the land, and will corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.26'>I call heaven and earth to witness against you{+} this day, that you{+} will soon completely perish from off the land to where you{+} go over the Jordan to possess it; you{+} will not prolong your{+} days on it, but will be completely destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.27'>And Yahweh will scatter you{+} among the peoples, and you{+} will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you{+} away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.28'>And there you{+} will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.29'>But from there you{+} will seek Yahweh your God, and you will find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.30'>When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you, in the latter days you will return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.31'>for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.32'>Ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of heaven to the other, whether there has been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.33'>Did ever a people hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.34'>Or has any god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your{+} God did for you{+} in Egypt before your{+} eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.35'>To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God; there is no other besides him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.36'>Out of heaven he made you hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.37'>And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.38'>to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.39'>Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.40'>And you will keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your sons after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.41'>Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.42'>that the manslayer might flee there, that slays his fellow man unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.43'>[namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.44'>And this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.45'>these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.46'>beyond the Jordan, in the valley across from Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.47'>And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.48'>from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to mount Sion (the same is Hermon),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.49'>and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.5'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.1'>And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your{+} ears this day, that you{+} may learn them, and observe to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.2'>Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.3'>Yahweh did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.4'>Yahweh spoke with you{+} face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.5'>(I stood between Yahweh and you{+} at that time, to show you{+} the word of Yahweh: for you{+} were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up into the mount;) saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.6'>I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.7'>You will have no other gods before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.8'>You will not make to you a graven image, [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.9'>you will not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.10'>and showing loving-kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.11'>You will not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him innocent that takes his name in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.12'>Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.13'>Six days you will labor, and do all your work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.14'>but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God: you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male slave, nor your female slave, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is inside your gates; that your male slave and your female slave may rest as well as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.15'>And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.16'>Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.17'>You will not kill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.18'>Neither will you commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.19'>Neither will you steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.20'>Neither will you bear false witness against your fellow man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.21'>Neither will you covet your fellow man's wife; neither will you desire your fellow man's house, his field, or his male slave, or his female slave, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your fellow man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.22'>These words Yahweh spoke to all your{+} assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.23'>And it came to pass, when you{+} heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you{+} came near to me, even all the heads of your{+} tribes, and your{+} elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.24'>and you{+} said, Look, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and yet he [still] lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.25'>Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God anymore, then we will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.26'>For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.27'>You go near, and hear all that Yahweh our God will say: and you speak to us all that Yahweh our God will speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.28'>And Yahweh heard the voice of your{+} words, when you{+} spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.29'>Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their sons forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.30'>Go say to them, You{+} return to your{+} tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.31'>But as for you, you stand here by me, and I will speak to you all [of] the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you will teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.32'>You{+} will observe to do therefore as Yahweh your{+} God has commanded you{+}: you{+} will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.33'>You{+} will walk in all the way which Yahweh your{+} God has commanded you{+}, that you{+} may live, and that it may be well with you{+}, and that you{+} may prolong your{+} days in the land which you{+} will possess.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.6'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.1'>Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your{+} God commanded to teach you{+}, that you{+} might do them in the land where you{+} go over to possess it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.2'>that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.3'>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you{+} may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.4'>Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.5'>and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.6'>And these words, which I command you this day, will be on your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.7'>and you will teach them diligently to your sons, and will talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.8'>And you will bind them for a sign on your hand, and they will be for frontlets between your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.9'>And you will write them on the door-posts of your house, and on your gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.10'>And it will be, when Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.11'>and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns cut out, which you didn't cut, vineyards and olive-trees, which you didn't plant, and you will eat and be full;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.12'>You be careful not to forget Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.13'>You will fear Yahweh your God; and him you will serve, and will swear by his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.14'>You{+} will not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.15'>for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; if you do, the anger of Yahweh your God will be kindled against you, and he will destroy you from off the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.16'>You{+} will not try Yahweh your{+} God, as you{+} tried him in Massah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.17'>You{+} will diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your{+} God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.18'>And you will do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.19'>to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.20'>When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What [is the meaning of] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.21'>Then you will say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.22'>and Yahweh showed signs and wonders, great and intense, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.23'>and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.24'>And Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.6.25'>And it will be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all [of] this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.7'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.1'>When Yahweh your God will bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and will cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.2'>and when Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and you will strike them; then you will completely destroy them: you will make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.3'>neither will you make marriages with them; your daughter you will not give to his son, nor his daughter will you take to your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.4'>For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you{+}, and he will destroy you quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.5'>But thus you{+} will deal with them: you{+} will break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.6'>For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.7'>Yahweh did not set his love on you{+}, nor choose you{+}, because you{+} were more in number than any people; for you{+} were the fewest of all peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.8'>but because Yahweh loves you{+}, and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your{+} fathers, has Yahweh brought you{+} out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you{+} out of the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.9'>Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving-kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.10'>and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.11'>You will therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.7.13'>and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.14'>You will be blessed above all peoples: there will not be male or female barren among you{+}, or among your{+} cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.15'>And Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.16'>And you will consume all the peoples that Yahweh your God will deliver to you; your eye will not pity them: neither will you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.17'>If you will say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.18'>You will not be afraid of them: you will well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.19'>the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so will Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.20'>Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.21'>You will not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.22'>And Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, or else the beasts of the field will increase on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.23'>But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.24'>And he will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will make their name to perish from under heaven: no man will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.7.25'>The graven images of their gods you{+} will burn with fire: you will not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to you, or else you will be snared in it; for it is disgusting to Yahweh your God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>Also in Horeb you{+} provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you{+} to destroy you{+}.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>And Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And I took your{+} sin, the calf which you{+} had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mount.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.32.20'>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: For they are a very perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.21'>They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.22'>For a fire is kindled in my anger, And burns to the lowest Sheol, And devours the earth with its increase, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.23'>I will heap evils on them; I will spend my arrows on them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.24'>[They will be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.25'>Outside will the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; [It will destroy] both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.26'>I said, I would scatter them far, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among common man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.27'>Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Or else their adversaries should judge amiss, And they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Yahweh has not done all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.28'>For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.29'>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.30'>How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Yahweh had delivered them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.31'>For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.32'>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.33'>Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.34'>Isn't this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.35'>For the day of vengeance and recompense will come in time. Their foot will slide, for the day of their calamity is near. And the things that are to come upon them will hurry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.36'>For Yahweh will judge his people, And repent himself for his slaves; When he sees that [their] power is gone, And there is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.37'>And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.38'>Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you{+} Let them be your{+} protection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.39'>See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.40'>For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.41'>If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand takes hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, And will recompense those who hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.42'>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, And my sword will devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the longhaired heads of the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.43'>Rejoice with him, [you{+}] heavens. And bow down before him, all [you{+}] gods. For he will avenge the blood of his sons, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will pay back those who hate him, And will make expiation for the land of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.44'>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.45'>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.46'>And he said to them, Set your{+} heart to all the words which I testify to you{+} this day, which you{+} will command your{+} sons to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.47'>For it is no vain thing for you{+}; because it is your{+} life, and through this thing you{+} will prolong your{+} days in the land, where you{+} go over the Jordan to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.48'>And Yahweh spoke to Moses that very same day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.49'>Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and look at the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.50'>and die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.51'>because you{+} trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you{+} did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.52'>For you will see the land before you; but you will not go there into the land which I give the sons of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.34.1'>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is across from Jericho. And Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,</verse>
