  <div osisID='Jonah' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.1'>Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.2'>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness has come up before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.3'>But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.4'>But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was likely to be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.5'>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it to them. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.6'>So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What do you mean, O sleeper? Arise, call on your God, perhaps God will think on us, that we will not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.7'>And they said every one to his fellow man, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.8'>Then they said to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is on us; what is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.9'>And he said to them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.10'>Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, What is this that you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.11'>Then they said to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.12'>And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so the sea will be calm to you{+}: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is on you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.13'>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.14'>Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, We urge you, O Yahweh, we urge you, let us not perish for this man's life, and don't lay innocent blood on us; for you, O Yahweh, have done as it pleased you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.15'>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.16'>Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.17'>And Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the insides of the fish three days and three nights.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.1'>Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God out of the insides of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.2'>And he said, I called by reason of my affliction to Yahweh, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, [And] you heard my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.3'>For you had cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All your waves and your billows passed over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.4'>And I said, I am cast out from before your eyes; Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.5'>The waters surrounded me, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.6'>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars [closed] on me forever: Yet you have brought up my life from the pit, O Yahweh my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.7'>When my soul fainted inside me, I remembered Yahweh; And my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.8'>Those who regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.9'>But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.10'>And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.1'>And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.2'>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the preaching that I bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.3'>So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, of three days' journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.4'>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh will be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.5'>And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.6'>And the news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.7'>And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; don't let them feed, nor drink water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.8'>but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily to God: yes, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.9'>Who knows whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we will not perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.10'>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do to them; and he did not do it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.1'>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.2'>And he prayed to Yahweh, and said, I pray you, O Yahweh, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, and one who repents of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.3'>Therefore now, O Yahweh, take, I urge you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.4'>And Yahweh said, Do you well to be angry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.5'>Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made for himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.6'>And Yahweh God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the gourd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.7'>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it struck the gourd, that it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.8'>And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.9'>And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.10'>And Yahweh said, You have had regard for the gourd, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.11'>and should I not have regard for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than sixscore thousand of man who can't discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</verse>
