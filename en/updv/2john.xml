        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth's sake which stays in us, and it will be with us forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I urge you, lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you{+} heard from the beginning, that you{+} should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone forth into the world: those who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that you{+} don't lose the things which we have worked for, but that you{+} receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever goes onward and doesn't stay in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God: he who stays in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you{+}, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into [your{+}] house, and give him no greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who gives him greeting shares in his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you{+}, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you{+}, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you.</verse>
