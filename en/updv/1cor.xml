      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is at Corinth, [even] those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, [the] called saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their [Lord] and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always concerning you{+}, for the grace of God which was given you{+} in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you{+} were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you{+} come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you{+} to the end, [that you{+} are] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, through whom you{+} were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I urge you{+}, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you{+} speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you{+}; but [that] you{+} are completely joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been signified to me concerning you{+}, my brothers, by them [who are of the household] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now this I mean, that each of you{+} says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you{+}? Or were you{+} baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you{+}, except Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any man should say that you{+} were baptized into my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I don't know whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ didn't send me to baptize, but to preach the good news: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is to those who perish foolishness; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning I will bring to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For look at your{+} calling, brothers, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame those who are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, God chose, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh should glory before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him are you{+} in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, according to as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brothers, when I came to you{+}, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you{+} the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know anything among you{+}, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you{+} in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your{+} faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full-grown: yet a wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that has been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages to our glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age has known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But to us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so the things of God none knows, except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>Now the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he can't know them, because they are spiritually judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he who is spiritual judges all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, could not speak to you{+} as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to juveniles in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you{+} with milk, not with meat; for you{+} were not yet able [to bear it]: no, not even now are you{+} able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you{+} are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you{+} jealousy and strife, are you{+} not carnal, and do you{+} not walk after the manner of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you{+} not men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you{+} believed; and to each as the Lord gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he who plants anything, neither he who waters; but God who gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one: but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's coworkers: you{+} are God's husbandry, God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another builds on it. But let each take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For another foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each man's work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will prove each man's work of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man's work that he built on it stays, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself will be saved; yet so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Don't you{+} know that you{+} are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinks that he is wise among you{+} in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you{+} are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account of us, as of attendants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you{+}, or of man's judgment: yes, I do not judge my own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing against myself; yet I am not hereby justified: but he who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then each will have his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your{+} sakes; that in us you{+} might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written; that no one of you{+} is puffed up for the one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you to differ? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you{+} are filled, already you{+} have become rich, you{+} have come to reign without us: yes and I would that you{+} did reign, that we also might reign with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you{+} are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you{+} are strong; you{+} have glory, but we have dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you{+}, but to admonish you{+} as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you{+} have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you{+} have] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begot you{+} through the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I urge you{+} therefore, be{+} imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause I have sent to you{+} Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will put you{+} in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you{+} shortly, if the Lord wills; and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you{+} want? Shall I come to you{+} with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is fornication among you{+}, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you{+}] has his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you{+} are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he who had participated in this deed might be taken away from among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I truly, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him who has so worked this thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus, you{+} being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your{+} glorying is not good. Don't you{+} know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, that you{+} may be a new lump, even as you{+} are unleavened. For our Passover also has been sacrificed, [even] Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you{+} in my letter not to associate with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the greedy and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you{+} must needs go out of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>but as it is, I wrote to you{+} not to associate with any man who is named a brother if he is a fornicator, or greedy, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; do not even eat with such a one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging those who are outside? Do not you{+} judge those who are inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those who are outside God will judge. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you{+}, having a matter against the other, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or don't you{+} know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you{+}, are you{+} unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Don't you{+} know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you{+} have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you{+} set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say [this] to move you{+} to shame. What, can't there be [found] among you{+} one wise man who will be able to decide between his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Therefore already it is altogether a defect in you{+}, that you{+} have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>No, but you{+} yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your{+}] brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or don't you{+} know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you{+}: but you{+} were washed, but you{+} were sanctified, but you{+} were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Don't you{+} know that your{+} bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or don't you{+} know that he who sticks to the prostitute is one body? For, The two, he says, will become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he who sticks to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or don't you{+} know that your{+} body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you{+}, which you{+} have from God? And you{+} are not your{+} own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you{+} were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your{+} body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things of which you{+} wrote: It is good for a man not to have any sex with a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But, because of fornications, let each have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now there are many members, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye can't say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I would have all of you{+} speak with tongues, yet even better that you{+} should prophesy: and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks with tongues, except he interprets, that the church may receive edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you{+} speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you{+}, unless I speak to you{+} either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they don't give a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also you{+}, unless you{+} utter by the tongue speech easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you{+} will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no [kind] is without significance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I don't know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who speaks a barbarian, and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you{+} indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brothers? When you{+} come together, each has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any man speaks in a tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most three, and [that] in turn; and let one interpret:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And let the prophets speak [by] two or three, and let the others discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you{+} can all prophesy one at a time, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>
