        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly [places] in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>having preappointed us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>to a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth; in him, [I say,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>in whom also we were made a heritage, having been preappointed according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>in whom you{+} also, having heard the word of the truth, the good news of your{+} salvation, --in whom, having also believed, you{+} were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>which is a security deposit of our inheritance, to the redemption of [God's] own possession, to the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you{+}, and the love which [you{+} show] toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>do not cease to give thanks for you{+}, making mention [of you{+}] in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you{+} a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>having the eyes of your{+} heart enlightened, that you{+} may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what is the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly [places],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all things in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And you{+} [he made alive,] when you{+} were dead through your{+} trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you{+} once walked according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom we also all once lived in the desire of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ, (by grace you{+} have been saved)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly [places], in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>for by grace you{+} have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, [it is] the gift of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, that no man should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember, that once you{+}, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>that you{+} were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus you{+} who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, who made both one, and in his flesh broke down the middle wall of partition, the enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>Having abolished the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; that he might create in himself the two into one new man, [so] making peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>and he came and preached [the good news of] peace to you{+} who were far off, and peace to those who were near:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>So then you{+} are no more strangers and sojourners, but you{+} are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>in whom each building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom you{+} also are built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you{+} Gentiles--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if indeed you{+} have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given to me toward you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>how that by revelation was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>by which, when you{+} read, you{+} can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>[to wit], that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles [the good news of] the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which since the [past] ages has been hid in God who created all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>to the intent that now to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly [places] might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the purpose of the ages which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I ask that you{+} may not faint at my tribulations for you{+}, which are your{+} glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he would grant you{+}, according to the riches of his glory, that you{+} may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your{+} hearts through faith; to the end that you{+}, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you{+} may be filled to all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to him [be] the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generations of forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you{+} to walk worthily of the calling with which you{+} were called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>[There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as also you{+} were called in one hope of your{+} calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, he gave gifts to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he gave some [to be] apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the preparing of the saints, to the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>that we may no longer be juveniles, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, [even] Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom all the body being joined and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in [due] measure of each individual part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you{+} no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who, feeling no more pain, delivered themselves up to sexual immorality, to work all impurity with greed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you{+} did not so learn Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed you{+} heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that you{+} put away, as concerning your{+} former manner of life, the old man, that waxes corrupt after the desires of deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and that you{+} are renewed in the spirit of your{+} mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and put on the new man, that after God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak{+} truth each one with his fellow man: for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be{+} angry, and don't sin: don't let the sun go down on your{+} wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>neither give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him who stole steal no more: and even better, let him labor, working with his own hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your{+} mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you{+} were sealed to the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you{+}, with all malice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>and be{+} kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you{+}.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be{+} therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and walk in love, even as Christ also loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But fornication, all impurity, or greed, don't let it even be named among you{+}, as becomes saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this you{+} know for sure, that anyone who is a fornicator, or unclean, or greedy (that is, an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no man deceive you{+} with empty words: for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore don't be{+} partakers with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you{+} were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>--for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and even better, reprove them as well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>for everything that is made manifest is light. Therefore [he] says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Look therefore carefully how you{+} walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore don't be{+} foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And don't be drunk with wine, in which is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your{+} heart to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, [be in subjection] to your{+} own husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, [being] himself the savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your{+} wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church], not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>because we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will stick to his wife; and the two will become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless, let each one of you{+} also love his own wife even as himself; but the wife should fear her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your{+} parents in the Lord: for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And, you{+} fathers, do not provoke your{+} children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Slaves, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your{+} masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your{+} heart, as to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will serving as slaves, as to the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good thing each one does, the same he will receive again from the Lord, whether slave or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And, you{+} masters, do the same things to them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours{+} is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armor of God, that you{+} may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you{+} may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand therefore, having girded your{+} loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and having fastened your{+} feet in the foundation of the good news of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>as well taking up the shield of faith, with which you{+} will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.19'>And on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.20'>for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.21'>But that you{+} also may know my affairs, what I participate in, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you{+} all things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.22'>whom I have sent to you{+} for this very purpose, that you{+} may know our state, and that he may comfort your{+} hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.23'>Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.24'>Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with [a love] incorruptible.</verse>
