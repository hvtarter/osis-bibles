      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you{+} and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begot us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who by the power of God are guarded through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In which you{+} greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you{+} have been put to grief in manifold trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the proof of your{+} faith, [being] more precious than gold that perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found to praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom not having seen you{+} love; on whom, though now you{+} do not see him, yet believing, you{+} rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the end of your{+} faith, [even] the salvation of [your{+}] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that [should come] to you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching what [time] or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point to, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you{+}, they were providing these things, which now have been announced to you{+} through those who preached the good news to you{+} by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore girding up the loins of your{+} mind, be sober and set your{+} hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you{+} at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as sons of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your{+} former desires in [the time of] your{+} ignorance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but like he who called you{+} is holy, be{+} yourselves also holy in all manner of living;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, You{+} will be holy; for I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you{+} call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your{+} sojourning in fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that you{+} were redeemed from your{+} useless manner of life handed down from your{+} fathers, not with corruptible things, silver or gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, [even the blood] of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of times for your{+} sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your{+} faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Seeing you{+} have purified your{+} souls in your{+} obedience to the truth to unfeigned love of the brothers, love one another fervently from a pure heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and stays.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For, All flesh is as grass, And all its glory as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>But the word of the Lord stays forever. And this is the word of good news which was preached to you{+}.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babies, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that you{+} may grow by it to salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if you{+} have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>to whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you{+} also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Because it is contained in Scripture, Look, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he who believes on him will not be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>For you{+} therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: to which also they were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you{+} are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for [God's] own possession, that you{+} may show forth the excellencies of him who called you{+} out of darkness into his marvelous light:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I urge you{+} as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your{+} behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, in what they speak against you{+} as evildoers, they may by your{+} good works, which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For so is the will of God, that by doing good you{+} should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not using your{+} freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as slaves of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Household slaves, [be] in subjection to your{+} masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endures griefs, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory is it, if, when you{+} sin, and are buffeted [for it], you{+} will take it patiently? But if, when you{+} do good, and suffer [for it], you{+} will take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For hereunto were you{+} called: because Christ also suffered for you{+}, leaving you{+} an example, that you{+} should follow his steps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered did not threaten; but delivered [himself] to him who judges righteously:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you{+} were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you{+} were like sheep that go astray; but have now been returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your{+} souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In like manner, you{+} wives, [be] in subjection to your{+} own husbands; that, even if any do not obey the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>watching your{+} chaste behavior [coupled] with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Whose [adorning] let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [apparel] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For after this manner previously the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You{+} became her children--doing good and not being put in fear by any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>You{+} husbands, in like manner, dwell with [your{+} wives] according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your{+} prayers not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all of you{+} [be] likeminded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humbleminded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary blessing; for hereunto were you{+} called, that you{+} should inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For, He who would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And his ears to their supplication: But the face of the Lord is on those who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he that will harm you{+}, if you{+} are zealous of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you{+} should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are you{+}:] and don't be afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but sanctify in your{+} hearts the Lord Christ: [being] ready always to give answer to every man who asks you{+} a reason concerning the hope that is in you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>yet with meekness and fear, having a good conscience; that, in what you{+} are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your{+} good manner of life in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that you{+} suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you{+} to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who previously were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>which also after a true likeness does now save you{+}, [even] baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, you{+} arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>that you{+} no longer should live the rest of your{+} time in the flesh to the desires of men, but to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time past may suffice to have worked the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in sexual immorality, erotic desires, winebibbings, revelings, carousings, and horrible idolatries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>in which they think it strange that you{+} do not run with [them] into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you{+}]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For to this end was the good news preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand: be{+} therefore of sound mind, and be sober to prayer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>above all things being fervent in your{+} love among yourselves; for love covers a multitude of sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>using hospitality one to another without murmuring:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>according to as each has received a gift, serving [with] it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>if any man speaks, [speaking] as it were oracles of God; if any man serves, [serving] as of the strength which God supplies: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, don't think it strange concerning the fiery trial among you{+}, which comes on you{+} to prove you{+}, as though a strange thing happened to you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but insomuch as you{+} share in Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also you{+} may rejoice with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you{+} are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed [are you{+}]; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>For let none of you{+} suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other men's matters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>but if [a man suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if [it begins] first at us, what [will be] the end of those who do not obey the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders among you{+} I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Shepherd the flock of God which is among you{+}, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for greed of monetary gain, but eagerly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you{+}, but making yourselves examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the chief Shepherd will be manifested, you{+} will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, you{+} younger, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you{+} gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you{+} in due time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your{+} anxiety on him, because he cares for you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be watchful: your{+} adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>whom withstand steadfast in your{+} faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your{+} brothers who are in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>And the God of all grace, who called you{+} to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you{+} have suffered a little while, will himself restore, establish, strengthen, [and] firmly set [you{+}].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him [be] the dominion forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account [him], I have written to you{+} briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand{+} fast in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She who is in Babylon, elect together with [you{+}], greets you{+}; and [so does] Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you{+} who are in Christ.</verse>
