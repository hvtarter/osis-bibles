  <div osisID='Hos' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution; for the land commits great prostitution, [departing] from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she became pregnant, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And Yahweh said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it will come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a daughter. And [Yahweh] said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>And [Yahweh] said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for you{+} are not my people, and I will not be your{+} [God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the sons of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, You{+} are not my people, it will be said to them, [You{+} are] the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say{+} to your{+} brothers, Ammi; and to your{+} sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your{+} mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>or else I will strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>Yes, on her sons I will have no mercy; for they are sons of prostitution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>for their mother has prostituted; she who became pregnant with them has done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, look, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she will not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she will follow after her lovers, but she will not overtake them; and she will seek them, but will not find them: then will she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then it was better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none will deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit on her the days of the Baalim, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, look, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it will be at that day, says Yahweh, that you will call: Ishi; and will call me no more: Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they will no more be mentioned by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth you to me forever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you will know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it will come to pass in that day, I will answer, says Yahweh, I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth will answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will answer Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people; and they will say, [You are] my God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And Yahweh said to me, Go again, love a woman loved by a companion, but [is] an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>and I said to her, You will remain with me many days; you will not prostitute; and you will not have any sex with any man--not even me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the sons of Israel will remain many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or talismans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>afterward the sons of Israel will return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and will come with fear to Yahweh and to his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} sons of Israel; for Yahweh has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>Swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery are rampant; and blood is everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the land will mourn, and everyone who dwells in it will languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yes, the fish of the sea also will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for your people are as those who strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>And you will stumble in the day, and the prophet also will stumble with you in the night; and I will destroy your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of the knowledge [of God]: because you have rejected the knowledge [of God], I will also reject you, that you will be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And it will be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>And they will eat, and not have enough; they will cause prostitution, and will not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them; for the spirit of prostitution has caused them to err, and they have prostituted, [departing] from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because their shadow is good: therefore your{+} daughters commit prostitution, and your{+} brides commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your{+} daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your{+} brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with prostitutes; and the people that does not understand will be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though you, Israel, are prostituting, yet don't let Judah offend; and don't come{+} to Gilgal, neither go{+} up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Yahweh lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now Yahweh will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink has become sour; they prostitute continually; her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they will be put to shame because of their altars.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, O you{+} priests, and listen, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for to you{+} pertains the judgment; for you{+} have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And the revolters have gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have prostituted, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is inside them, and they don't know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity; Judah also will stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they will not find him: he has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have betrayed Yahweh; for they have borne strange sons: now will the new moon devour them with their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow{+} the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind you, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which will surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was determined to walk after crap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore I am to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king: but he is not able to heal you{+}, neither will he cure you{+} of your{+} wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there will be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days he will revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we will live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>And let us know, let us follow on to know Yahweh: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your{+} goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goes forth as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they like man have transgressed the covenant: there they have betrayed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yes, they have committed lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there prostitution is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I bring back the captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the troop of robbers ravages outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they don't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceases to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have brought their heart into their ambush, as into an oven: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings have fallen: there is none among them who calls to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know [it]: yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he does not know [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: yet they have not returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they will go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them! For they have wandered from me; destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds: they gash themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they devise mischief against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not upwards; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this will be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>[Set] the trumpet to your mouth. As an eagle [he comes] against the house of Yahweh, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They will cry to me, My God, we Israel know you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off that which is good: the enemy will pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I did not know it: of their silver and their gold they have made for themselves idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>He has cast off your calf, O Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be before they attain to innocence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is not God; yes, the calf of Samaria will be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind: he has no standing grain; the blade will yield no meal; if it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now they are among the nations as a vessel in which none delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria, [like] a wild donkey alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yes, though they hire among the nations, now I will gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Yahweh does not accept them: now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they will return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire on their cities, and it will devour their castles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Don't rejoice, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for you have prostituted [away] from your God; you have loved hire on every grain-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing-floor and the wine press will not feed them, and the new wine will fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They will not dwell in Yahweh's land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They will not pour out wine-offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices will be to them as the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite; it will not come into the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you{+} do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, look, they have gone away from destruction; [yet] Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles will possess them; thorns will be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel will know it: the prophet is a fool, the man who has the spirit is insane, for the abundance of your iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your{+} fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became detestable things like that which they loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird: there will be no birth, and no pregnancy, and no conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.12'>Though they bring up their sons, yet I will bereave them, so that man will not be left: yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.13'>I saw Ephraim as a grove of palm trees planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim will bring out his sons to the slayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.14'>Give them, O Yahweh--what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.15'>All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.16'>Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they will bear no fruit: yes, though they bring forth, yet I will slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.17'>My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.10'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.1'>Israel is a luxuriant vine, that puts forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.2'>Their heart is divided; now they will be found guilty: he will strike their altars, he will destroy their pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.3'>Surely now they will say, We have no king; for we don't fear Yahweh; and the king, what can he do for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.4'>They speak [vain] words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.5'>The neighbor of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people will mourn over it, and its priests who rejoiced over it, for its glory, because it has departed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.6'>It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to the great king: Ephraim will receive shame, and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.7'>Samaria is cut off, her king as a twig on the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.8'>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars; and they will say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.9'>O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the sons of iniquity does not overtake them in Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.10'>When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples will be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two furrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.11'>And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loves to tread out [the grain]; but I have passed by her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah will plow, Jacob will break his clods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.12'>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your{+} fallow ground; for it is time to seek Yahweh, until he comes and rains righteousness on you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.13'>You{+} have plowed wickedness, you{+} have reaped iniquity; you{+} have eaten the fruit of lies; for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.14'>Therefore will a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.15'>So Beth-el will do to you{+} because of your{+} great wickedness: at daybreak the king of Israel will be completely cut off.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.11'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.1'>When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.2'>The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.3'>Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; He took them up in his arms; but they did not know that I healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.4'>I drew them with cords of man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke from their jaws; and I laid food before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.5'>They will not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to return [to me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.6'>And the sword will fall on their cities, and will consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.7'>And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him who is] on high, none at all will exalt [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.8'>How shall I give you up, Ephraim? [How] shall I cast you off, Israel? How shall I make you as Admah? [How] shall I set you as Zeboiim? My heart is turned inside me, my compassions are kindled together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.9'>I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; and I will not come in wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.10'>They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the sons will come trembling from the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.11'>They will come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.11.12'>Ephraim circles me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; and even Judah went down from God and the faithful Holy One.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.12'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.1'>Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he continually multiplies lies and violence; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.2'>Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings he will recompense him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.3'>In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.4'>yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spoke with us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.5'>even Yahweh, the God of hosts; Yahweh is his memorial [name].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.6'>Therefore you will turn to your God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.7'>[He is] a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.8'>And Ephraim said, Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself: in all my labors they will find in me no iniquity which [would be] sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.9'>But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make you to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.10'>I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the hand of the prophets I have used similitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.11'>Is Gilead iniquity? They are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yes, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.12'>And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.13'>And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.12.14'>Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore his blood will be left on him, and his reproach his Lord will return to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.13'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.1'>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.2'>And now they sin more and more, and have made for themselves molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let man who sacrifices kiss the calves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.3'>Therefore they will be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passes early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.4'>Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you will know no god but me, and besides me there is no savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.5'>I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.6'>According to their pasture, so they were filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore they have forgotten me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.7'>Therefore I am to them as a lion; as a leopard I will watch by the way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.8'>I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there I will devour them like a lioness; the wild beast will tear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.9'>It is your destruction, O Israel, that [you are] against me, against your help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.10'>Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? And your judges, of whom you said, Give me a king and princes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.11'>I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.12'>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.13'>The sorrows of a travailing woman will come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.14'>I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O Death, I will be your plague. O Sheol, I will be your destruction. Repentance will be hid from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.15'>Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come, the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness; and his spring will become dry, and his fountain will be dried up: he will make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.13.16'>Samaria will bear her guilt; for she has rebelled against her God: they will fall by the sword; their infants will be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped up.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.14'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.1'>O Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.2'>Take with you{+} words, and return to Yahweh: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so we will render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.3'>Assyria will not save us; we will not ride on horses; neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands, [You{+} are] our gods; for in you the fatherless finds mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.4'>I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.5'>I will be as the dew to Israel; he will blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.6'>His branches will spread, and his beauty will be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.7'>Those who dwell under his shadow will return; they will revive the grain, and blossom as the vine: his scent will be as the wine of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.8'>Ephraim [will say], What have I to do anymore with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is your fruit found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.14.9'>Who is wise, that he may understand these things? Prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Yahweh are right, and the just will walk in them; but transgressors will fall in them.</verse>
