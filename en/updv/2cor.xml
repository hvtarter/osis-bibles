  <div osisID='2Cor' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But whether we are afflicted, it is for your{+} comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your{+} comfort, which works in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>and our hope for you{+} is steadfast; knowing that, as you{+} are partners of the sufferings, so also are you{+} of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we would not have you{+} ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction which befell [us] in Asia, that we were exceedingly weighed down, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death inside ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you{+} also helping together on our behalf by your{+} supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, and not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you{+}, than what you{+} read or even acknowledge, and I hope you{+} will acknowledge to the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>as also you{+} did acknowledge us in part, that we are your{+} glorying, even as you{+} also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I was minded to come first to you{+}, that you{+} might have a second benefit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and by you{+} to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you{+}, and of you{+} to be set forward on my journey to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yes yes and the no no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is faithful, our word toward you{+} is not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For God's Son, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you{+} by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him is yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For however many are the promises of God, in him is the yes: therefore also through him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now he who establishes us with you{+} in Christ, and anointed us, is God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also sealed us, and gave [us] the security deposit of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God for a witness on my soul, that to spare you{+} I forbare to come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have lordship over your{+} faith, but are coworkers of your{+} joy: for in faith you{+} stand fast.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you{+} with sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you{+} sorry, who then is he that makes me glad but he that is made sorry by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in all of you{+}, that my joy is [the joy] of all of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you{+} with many tears; not that you{+} should be made sorry, but that you{+} might know the love that I have more abundantly to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to all of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that on the contrary you{+} should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with too much sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I urge you{+} to confirm [your{+}] love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you{+}, whether you{+} are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>But to whom you{+} forgive anything, I [forgive] also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your{+} sakes [I have forgiven it] in the presence of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and makes manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are a sweet savor of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to the one a savor from death to death; to the other a savor from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you{+} or from you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Our letter is you{+}, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being made manifest that you{+} are a letter of Christ, served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And such confidence we have through Christ toward God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the service of death, written, [and] engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which [glory] was passing away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will not rather the service of the spirit be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if in the service of condemnation [there is] glory, much rather does the service of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For truly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which passes away [was] with glory, much more that which stays [is] in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and [are] not as Moses, [who] put a veil on his face, that the sons of Israel should not look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>but their minds were hardened. For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil stays, not being unveiled, because it is in Christ that it is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But upon turning to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But all of us, with unveiled face looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore seeing we have this service even as we obtained mercy, we do not faint:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>And even if our good news is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn [on them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ the Lord, and ourselves as your{+} slaves for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Seeing it is God, that said, Light will shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>[we are] pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not to despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death works in us, but life in you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore I spoke; we also believe, and therefore we also speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus, and will present us with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things [are] for your{+} sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not faint; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For truly in this we groan, longing to be clothed on with our habitation which is from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if so be that being unclothed we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For indeed we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we want to be unclothed, but that we want to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he who worked us for this very thing is God, who gave to us the security deposit of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>For we walk by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we also make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he has participated in, whether [it is] good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your{+} consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We are not again commending ourselves to you{+}, but [speak] as giving you{+} occasion of glorying on our behalf, that you{+} may have the means to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and he died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>Therefore we from now on know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know [him so] no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if any man is in Christ, [he is] a new creation: the old things are passed away; look, they have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave to us the service of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we urge [you{+}] on behalf of Christ, be{+} reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>Him who knew no sin he made [to be] sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>And working together [with him] we entreat also that you{+} do not receive the grace of God in vain</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(for he says, At an acceptable time I listened to you, And in a day of salvation I helped you: look, now is the acceptable time; look, now is the day of salvation):</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service not be blamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>by glory and shame, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and [yet] true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and look, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>Our mouth is open to you{+}, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You{+} are not straitened in us, but you{+} are straitened in your{+} own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now for a recompense in like kind--I speak as to [my] children--be{+} also enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what communion has light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what concord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement has a temple of God with idols? For we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore Come{+} out from among them, and be{+} separate, says the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And will be to you{+} a Father, And you{+} will be to me sons and daughters, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Open your{+} hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I don't say it to condemn [you{+}]: for I have said before, that you{+} are in our hearts to die together and live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my boldness of speech toward you{+}, great is my glorying on your{+} behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but [we were] afflicted on every side; outside [were] fightings, inside [were] fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly, [even] God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you{+}, while he told us your{+} longing, your{+} mourning, your{+} zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For though I made you{+} sorry with my letter, I do not regret it: though I did regret [it] (for I see that that letter made you{+} sorry, though but for a season),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>I now rejoice, not that you{+} were made sorry, but that you{+} were made sorry to repentance; for you{+} were made sorry after a godly sort, that you{+} might suffer loss by us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, [a repentance] which brings no regret: but the sorrow of the world works death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For look, this very same thing, that you{+} were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it worked in you{+}, yes what clearing of yourselves, yes what indignation, yes what fear, yes what longing, yes what zeal, yes what avenging! In everything you{+} approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>So although I wrote to you{+}, I did not [write] for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your{+} earnest care for us might be made manifest to you{+} in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we have been comforted: And in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if in anything I have gloried to him on your{+} behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you{+} in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection is more abundantly toward you{+}, while he remembers the obedience of all of you{+}, how with fear and trembling you{+} received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you{+}.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brothers, we make known to you{+} the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For according to their power, I bear witness, yes and beyond their power, [they gave] of their own accord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>imploring us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>and [this], not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you{+} this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you{+} abound in everything, [in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all earnestness, and [in] our love to you{+}, [see] that you{+} abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I don't speak by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your{+} love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you{+} know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your{+} sakes he became poor, that you{+} through his poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give [my] judgment: for this is expedient for you{+}, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now complete the doing also; that as [there was] the readiness to will, so [there may be] the completion also out of your{+} ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the readiness is there, [it is] acceptable according to as [a man] has, not according to as [he] has not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For not that others may be eased [and] you{+} distressed; but by equality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>your{+} abundance at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become for your{+} want; that there may be equality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>as it is written, He who [gathered] much had nothing over; and he who [gathered] little had no lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you{+} into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you{+} of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the good news [is spread] through all the churches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches as our travel companion in [the matter of] this grace, which is being provided by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [to show] our readiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in [the matter of] this bounty which is being provided by us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which [he has] in you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>Whether [any inquire] about Titus, my partner and coworker toward you{+}, or our brothers, the messengers of the churches, [they are] the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show{+} to them in the face of the churches the proof of your{+} love, and of our glorying on your{+} behalf.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For as concerning the service to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>for I know your{+} readiness, of which I glory on your{+} behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past; and your{+} zeal has stirred up very many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I have sent the brothers, that our glorying on your{+} behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, you{+} may be prepared:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you{+} unprepared, we--not to mention you{+}--should be put to shame in this confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers, that they would go before to you{+}, and make up beforehand your{+} aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this [I say,] He who sows sparingly will reap also sparingly; and he who sows bountifully will reap also bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>[Let] each [do] according to as he has purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound to you{+}; that you{+}, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor; His righteousness stays forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>And he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will supply and multiply your{+} seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your{+} righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>you{+} being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the providing of this service of the ministry not only fills up the measure of the wants of the saints, but abounds also through many thanksgivings to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>seeing that through the proving [of you{+}] by this service they glorify God for the obedience of your{+} confession to the good news of Christ, and for the liberality of [your{+}] contribution to them and to all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>while they themselves also, with supplication on your{+} behalf, long after you{+} by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I Paul myself entreat you{+} by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your{+} presence am lowly among you{+}, but being absent am of good courage toward you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>yes, I urge you{+}, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence with which I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds, casting down imaginations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your{+} obedience will be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>You{+} look at the things that are before your{+} face. If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord gave for building you{+} up, and not for casting you{+} down, I will not be put to shame:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>that I may not seem as if I would terrify you{+} by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [are we] also in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of those who commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not glory beyond [our] measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not stretch ourselves too much, as though we did not reach to you{+}: for we came even as far as to you{+} in the good news of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not glorying beyond [our] measure, [that is,] in other men's labors; but having hope that, as your{+} faith grows, we will be magnified in you{+} according to our province to [further] abundance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>so as to preach the good news even to the parts beyond you{+}, [and] not to glory in another's province in regard of things ready to our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For [it is] not he who commends himself [who] is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>Would that you{+} could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed you{+} do bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you{+} with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you{+} to one husband, that I might present you{+} [as] a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your{+} minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if someone comes preaching a different Jesus than we preached, or you{+} receive a spirit other than you{+} received, or good news other than you{+} accepted, you{+} endure well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I reckon that I am not a bit behind the very chiefest apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But though [I am] unskilled in speaking, yet [I am] not [unskilled] in knowledge; certainly, in every way we have made [this] manifest to you{+} in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you{+} might be exalted, because I preached to you{+} the good news of God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches, taking wages to serve you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>and when I was present with you{+} and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you{+}, and [so] I will keep [myself].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man will stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you{+}? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, I will continue to do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire an occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder; for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>It is no great thing therefore if his servants also fashion themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if [you{+} do], yet receive me as foolish, that I also may glory a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>That which I speak, I don't speak after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you{+} bear with the foolish gladly, being wise [yourselves].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you{+} bear with a man, if he brings you{+} into slavery, if he devours you{+}, if he takes you{+} [captive], if he exalts himself, if he strikes you{+} on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak by way of shame, as though we had been weak. Yet in what any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Of the Jews five times I received forty [stripes] less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>[in] journeyings often, [in] perils of rivers, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils from [my] countrymen, [in] perils from the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>[in] labor and travail, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fasts often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn [with distress]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must surely glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forevermore knows that I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>and through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>I must surely glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know; or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I don't know; God knows),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>On behalf of such a one I will glory: but on my own behalf I will not glory, except in [my] weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I should desire to glory, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he sees me [to be], or hears from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted too much, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this thing I implored the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for [my] power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become foolish: you{+} compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you{+}: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you{+} in all patience, both by signs and wonders, and mighty works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is there in which you{+} were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except [it is] that I myself was not a burden to you{+}? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Look, this is the third time I am ready to come to you{+}; and I will not be a burden to you{+}: for I don't seek yours{+}, but you{+}: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your{+} souls. If I love you{+} more abundantly, am I loved the less?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But let it be so, I did not myself burden you{+}; but, being crafty, I caught you{+} with guile.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you{+}? Did we not walk in the same spirit? [Did we] not [walk] in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>You{+} think all this time that we are excusing ourselves to you{+}. In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, [are] for your{+} edifying.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest again when I come my God should humble me before you{+}, and I should mourn for many of those who have sinned before, and didn't repent of the impurity and fornication and sexual immorality in which they participated.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Try yourselves, whether you{+} are in the faith; approve yourselves. Or don't you{+} know as to yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you{+}? Unless indeed you{+} are disapproved.</verse>
