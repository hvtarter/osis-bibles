      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of you in my supplications, night and day</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God did not give us a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the good news according to the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but has now been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>to which I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>That good thing which was committed to [you] guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and wasn't ashamed of my chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>(the Lord grant to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And if also a man contends in the games, he is not crowned, except he has contended lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The husbandmen who labors must be the first to partake of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say; for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in which I suffer hardship to bonds, as a criminal; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we will also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we endure, we will also reign with him: if we will deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we are faithless, he stays faithful; for he can't deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of God, that they are not to strive about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed worker, correctly handling the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their word will eat as does a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his: and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared to every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And the Lord's slave must not strive, but be gentle toward all, apt to teach, forbearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in meekness correcting those who oppose themselves; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. From these also turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by diverse desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yes, and all who would live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But you stay in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that from a baby you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All Scripture [is] inspired of God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely to every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge [you] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own desires;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>from now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Be diligent to come shortly to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas forsook me, having loved this present age, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you; for he is useful to me in [my] service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom you also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defense no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you{+}.</verse>
