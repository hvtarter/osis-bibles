      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' [houses].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the slave of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-jearim to [the place] that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly sought to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God, You have shown great loving-kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you haven't asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you; neither will there any after you have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>So Solomon went to the high place that was at Gibeon, [then] from the tent of meeting [at Gibeon] to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king's merchants acquired those from Kue for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon counted out 70,000 men to bear burdens, and 80,000 men who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in it, [even so deal with me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Look, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is [an ordinance] forever to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except only to burn incense before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Now therefore send me a skillful man to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knows how to engrave [all manner of] engravings, [to be] with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your slaves know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, look, my slaves will be with your slaves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And, look, I will give to your slaves, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand cors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram said moreover, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be [a place] appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you will need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the sojourners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set 70,000 of them to bear burdens, and 80,000 who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where [Yahweh] appeared to David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the width twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that was before [the house], the length of it, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height 120; and he overlaid it inside with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought on it palm-trees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy house: its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of molten work; and they overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one [cherub] was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was [likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits [also], sticking to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>Also he made before the house two pillars of 35 cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains in the oracle, and put [them] on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>Moreover he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in a circle; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And under it was the likeness of oxen, which circled it round about, for ten cubits, circling the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And it was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward, toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for King Solomon in the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He also made the bases, and the basins he made on the bases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels of them, Huram his father made for King Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the bronze could not be found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which was the showbread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Yahweh was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was [in] the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; the Levitical priests brought these up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the ark but the two tables which Moses put [there] at Horeb, by which Yahweh made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his loving-kindness [endures] forever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon spoke, Yahweh has said that he would stay in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither did I choose any man to be leader over my people Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>nevertheless you will not build the house; but your son who will come forth out of your loins, he will build the house for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>And Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>(for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>and he said, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; who keeps covenant and loving-kindness with your slaves, that walk before you with all their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>who have kept with your slave David my father that which you promised him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now therefore, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your slave David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There will not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now therefore, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your slave David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But will God in very deed dwell with man on the earth? Look, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house which I have built!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>Yet you have respect to the prayer of your slave, and to his supplication, O Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your slave prays before you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your slave will pray toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And listen to the supplications of your slave, and of your people Israel, when they will pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when you hear forgive.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.7'>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.14'>And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so David the man of God had commanded.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.2'>And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he did not tell her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.12'>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.13'>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.11'>And now whereas my father laded you{+} with a heavy yoke, I will add to your{+} yoke: my father chastised you{+} with whips, but I [will chastise you{+}] with scorpions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.22'>And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the leader among his brothers; for [he was minded] to make him king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.23'>And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought [for them] many wives.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.1'>And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.3'>with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.4'>And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.5'>Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You{+} have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you{+} in the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.6'>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Yahweh is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.7'>And when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>Nevertheless they will be his slaves, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>And King Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And it was so, that, as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things [found].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>And he did that which was evil, because he did not set his heart to seek Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.16'>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.2'>He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.5'>Don't you{+} know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.6'>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the slave of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.7'>And there were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>And now you{+} think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you{+} are a great multitude, and there are with you{+} the golden calves which Jeroboam made you{+} for gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>Haven't you{+} driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? So that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [those that are] no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we haven't forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [they set] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Yahweh our God; but you{+} have forsaken him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>And, look, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you{+}. O sons of Israel, don't fight{+} against Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers; for you{+} will not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And when Judah looked back, and saw that the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.15'>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.17'>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.18'>Thus the sons of Israel were brought under at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.19'>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, 280,000: all these were mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength: help us, O Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Yahweh, you are our God; don't let common man prevail against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.14'>And they struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.15'>They struck also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.1'>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.2'>and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear{+} me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Yahweh is with you{+}, while you{+} are with him; and if you{+} seek him, he will be found of you{+}; but if you{+} forsake him, he will forsake you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.3'>Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.5'>And in those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the lands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.8'>And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the detestable things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.10'>So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.11'>And they sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.12'>And they entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>And they swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made a horrible image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her horrible image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.1'>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>[There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between my father and your father: look, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.5'>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.6'>Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built with them Geba and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.7'>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and haven't relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the host of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.8'>Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceedingly many? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.2'>And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.3'>And Jehoiada took for himself two wives; and he begot sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.4'>And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.5'>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your{+} God from year to year; and see that you{+} hurry the matter. Nevertheless the Levites did not hurry it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.6'>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why haven't you required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the slave of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.7'>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also they bestowed all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh on the Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.8'>So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.9'>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the slave of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.10'>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.11'>And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.12'>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such as wrought iron and bronze to repair the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.13'>So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.14'>And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Yahweh continually all the days of Jehoiada.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.15'>But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; he was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.16'>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.17'>Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.18'>And they forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.19'>Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.20'>And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why do you{+} transgress the commandments of Yahweh, so that you{+} can't prosper? Because you{+} have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.21'>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.22'>Thus Joash the king didn't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Yahweh look at it, and require it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.23'>And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.24'>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.25'>And when they had departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own slaves conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.26'>And these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.24.27'>Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] on him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, look, they are written in the Commentary of the Book of the Kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.25'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.1'>Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.2'>And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.3'>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his slaves who had killed the king his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.4'>But he did not put their sons to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the Book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The fathers will not die for the sons, neither will the sons die for the fathers; but every man will die for his own sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.5'>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.6'>He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.7'>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, don't let the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, [to wit], with all the sons of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.8'>But if you will go, do [valiantly], be strong for the battle: God will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.9'>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.10'>Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.11'>And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the sons of Seir ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.12'>And the sons of Judah carried away alive [another] ten thousand, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that all of them were broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.13'>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.14'>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.15'>Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which haven't delivered their own people out of your hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.16'>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him, Have we made you of the king's counsel? Forbear; why should you be struck? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and haven't listened to my counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.17'>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.18'>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.19'>You say, Look, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: remain now at home; why should you meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.20'>But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might hand them over, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.21'>So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.22'>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.23'>And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.24'>And [he took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.25'>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, look, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.27'>Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.28'>And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.26'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.1'>And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.2'>He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.3'>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.4'>And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.5'>And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.6'>And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the country of] Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.7'>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.8'>And the Meunites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceedingly strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.9'>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of the wall], and fortified them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.10'>And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: [and he had] husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.11'>Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.12'>The whole number of the heads of fathers' [houses], even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.13'>And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.14'>And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.15'>And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.16'>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.17'>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.18'>and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It does not pertain to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither will it be for your honor from Yahweh God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.19'>Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.20'>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and saw that he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, he himself hurried also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.21'>And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.22'>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.23'>So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.27'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.1'>Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.2'>And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: nevertheless he did not enter into the temple of Yahweh. And the people did yet corruptly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.3'>He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.4'>Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.5'>He fought also with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the sons of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the sons of Ammon render to him, in the second year also, and in the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.6'>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.7'>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, look, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.8'>He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.27.9'>And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.28'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.1'>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.2'>but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.3'>Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his sons in the fire, according to the disgusting behaviors of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.4'>And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.5'>Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.6'>For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.7'>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the leader of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.8'>And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.9'>But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Look, because Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your{+} hand, and you{+} have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.10'>And now you{+} purpose to subdue the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for male slaves and female slaves to yourselves: [but] are there not even with you{+} trespasses of your{+} own against Yahweh your{+} God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.11'>Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you{+} have taken captive of your{+} brothers; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.12'>Then certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.13'>and said to them, You{+} will not bring in the captives here: for you{+} purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.14'>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.15'>And the men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and arrayed them, and gave them sandals, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.16'>At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.17'>For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.18'>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they dwelt there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.19'>For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed intensely against Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.21'>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it did not help him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.23'>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, [therefore] I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.24'>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.28.25'>And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked Yahweh to anger, the God of his fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.35'>And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.5'>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.24'>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.25'>And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.26'>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.9'>And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.10'>And Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.11'>Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.12'>And when he was in distress, he implored Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.13'>And he prayed to him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.14'>Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he surrounded Ophel [with it], and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.15'>And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.16'>And he built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered on it sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.17'>Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, look, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.19'>His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places where he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: look, they are written in the history of Hozai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.20'>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.21'>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.23'>And he didn't humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.24'>And his slaves conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.25'>But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.1'>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.2'>And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves [of them] that had sacrificed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.5'>And he burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.6'>And [so he did] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, he searched their houses round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.7'>And he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.8'>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.10'>And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who wrought in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.11'>even to the carpenters and to the builders they gave it, to buy cut stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.12'>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and [others of] the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.13'>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.14'>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of Yahweh [given] by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Yahweh. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.16'>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your slaves, they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.17'>And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.18'>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.19'>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.20'>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's slave, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>Go{+}, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that was found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>So Hilkiah, and those whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Tell{+} the man who sent you{+} to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>But to the king of Judah, who sent you{+} to inquire of Yahweh, thus you{+} will say to him, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: As concerning the words which you have heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Look, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants. And they brought back word to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>Then he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the countries that pertained to the sons of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they did not depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>And Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>And he said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; there will no more be a burden on your{+} shoulders: now serve Yahweh your{+} God, and his people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>And prepare yourselves after your{+} fathers' houses by your{+} courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your{+} brothers the sons of the people, and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>And kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your{+} brothers, to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>And Josiah gave to the sons of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover-offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his princes gave for a freewill-offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the leaders of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king's commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] from their hand, and the Levites flayed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the sons of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>And they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the sons of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busy] in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they did not need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the sons of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>And there was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, king of Judah? [I come] not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded me to hurry: forbear yourself from [meddling with] God, who is with me, that he does not destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn't listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said to his slaves, Take me away; for I am critically wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>So his slaves took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, look, they are written in the lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>and his acts, first and last, look, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.2'>Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.6'>Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.7'>Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.8'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the disgusting things that he did, and that which was found in him, look, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.9'>Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.10'>And at the return of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God; he didn't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet [speaking] from the mouth of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the disgusting things of the nations; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>And Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people, until there was no remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.20'>And those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they were slaves to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.21'>to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths: [for] as long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you{+} of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.</verse>
