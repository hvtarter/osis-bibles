Ye louyde britheren of God, we witinge youre chesing;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>
for oure gospel was not at you in word oneli, but also in vertu, and in the Hooli Goost, and in myche plente; as ye witen, whiche we weren among you for you;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>
and ye ben maad foleweris of vs, and of the Lord, resseyuynge the word in myche tribulacioun, with ioye of the Hooli Goost;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>
so that ye ben maad ensaumple to alle men that bileuen, in Macedonye and in Acaie.

For of you the word of the Lord is pupplischid, not oneli in Macedonye and Acaie, but youre feith that is to God, in ech place is gon forth; so that it is not nede to vs to speke ony thing.

For thei schewen of you, what maner entre we hadden to you, and hou ye ben conuertid to God fro maumettis, to serue to the lyuynge God and veri; and to abide his sone fro heuenes,

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>
For, britheren, ye witen oure entre to you, for it was not veyn;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>
but first we suffriden, and weren punyschid with wrongis, as ye witen in Filippis, and hadden trust in oure Lord, to speke to you the gospel of God in myche bisynesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>
And oure exortacioun is not of errour, nether of vnclennesse, nether in gile,
</verse>

but as we ben preued of God, that the gospel of God schulde be takun to vs, so we speken; not as plesynge to men, but to God that preueth oure hertis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>
For nether we weren ony tyme in word of glosing, as ye witen, nether in occasioun of auerise; God is witnesse; nether sekinge glorie of men,

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>
nether of othere, whanne we, as Cristis apostlis, miyten haue be in charge to you. But we weren maad litle in the myddil of you, as if a nursche fostre hir sones;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>
so we desiringe you with greet loue, wolden haue bitake to you, not oneli the gospel of God, but also oure lyues, for ye ben maad most dereworthe to vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>
For, britheren, ye ben myndeful of oure trauel and werynesse; we worchiden nyyt and day, that we schulden not greue ony of you, and prechiden to you the euangelie of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>
God and ye ben witnessis, hou holili, and iustli, and with outen pleynt, we weren to you that bileueden.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>
As ye witen, hou we preyeden you, and coumfortiden ech of you, as the fadir hise sones,

Therfor we doon thankingis to God with outen ceessyng. For whanne ye hadden take of vs the word `of the heryng of God, ye token it not as the word of men, but as `it is verili, the word of God, that worchith in you that han bileued.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>
For, britheren, ye ben maad foleweris of the chirchis of God, that ben in Jude, in Crist Jhesu, for ye han suffrid the same thingis of youre euene lynagis, as thei of the Jewis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>
Whiche slowen bothe the Lord Jhesu and the profetis, and pursueden vs, and thei plesen not to God, and thei ben aduersaries to alle men;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>
forbedinge vs to speke to hethene men, that thei be maad saaf, that thei fille her synnes euere more; for the wraththe of God cam on hem in to the ende.

For which thing we suffriden no lengere, and it pleside to vs to dwelle aloone at Atenys;
