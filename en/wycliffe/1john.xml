That thing that was fro the bigynnyng, which we herden, which we sayn with oure iyen, which we bihelden, and oure hondis touchiden, of the word of lijf; and the lijf is schewid.

And we sayn, and we witnessen, and tellen to you the euerlastynge lijf, that was anentis the fadir, and apperide to vs.

Therfor `we tellen to you that thing, that we seyn, and herden, that also ye haue felowschipe with vs, and oure felowschip be with the fadir, and with his sone Jhesu Crist.

And this is the tellyng, that we herden of hym, and tellen to you, that God is liyt, and ther ben no derknessis in him.

If we seien, that we han felawschip with hym, and we wandren in derknessis, we lien, and don not treuthe.

But if we walken in liyt, as also he is in liyt, we han felawschip togidere; and the blood of Jhesu Crist, his sone, clensith vs fro al synne.

If we seien, that we han no synne, we disseyuen vs silf, and treuthe is not in vs.

And in this thing we witen, that we knowen hym, if we kepen hise comaundementis.

He that seith that he knowith God, and kepith not hise comaundementis, is a liere, and trewthe is not in hym.

But the charite of God is perfit verili in hym, that kepith his word. In this thing we witen, that we ben in hym, if we ben perfit in hym.

Moost dere britheren, Y write to you, not a newe maundement, but the elde maundement, that ye hadden fro the bigynnyng. The elde maundement is the word, that ye herden.

Eftsoone Y write to you a newe maundement, that is trewe bothe in hym and in you; for derknessis ben passid, and veri liyt schyneth now.

He that seith, that he is in liyt, and hatith his brother, is in derknesse yit.

He that loueth his brothir, dwellith in liyt, and sclaundre is not in hym.
</verse>

But he that hatith his brother, is in derknessis, and wandrith in derknessis, and woot not whidir he goith; for derknessis han blindid hise iyen.

Litle sones, Y write to you, that youre synnes ben foryouun to you for his name.

Fadris, Y write to you, for ye han knowun hym, that is fro the bigynnyng. Yonge men, Y write to you, for ye han ouercomun the wickid.
</verse>

Y write to you, yonge children, for ye han knowe the fadir. Y write to you, britheren, for ye han knowen hym, that is fro the bigynnyng. Y write to you, yonge men, for ye ben stronge, and the word of God dwellith in you, and ye han ouercomun the wickid.

Nyle ye loue the world, ne tho thingis that ben in the world. If ony man loueth the world, the charite of the fader is not in hym.

For al thing that is in the world, is coueitise of fleisch, and coueitise of iyen, and pride of lijf, which is not of the fadir, but it is of the world.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>
And the world schal passe, and the coueitise of it; but he that doith the wille of God, dwellith with outen ende.

My litle sones, the laste our is; and as ye han herd, that antecrist cometh, now many antecristis ben maad; wherfor we witen, that it is the laste our.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>
Thei wenten forth fro vs, but thei weren not of vs; for if thei hadden be of vs, thei hadden dwelte with vs; but that thei be knowun, that thei ben not of vs.

But ye han anointyng of the Hooli Goost, and knowen alle thingis.

Who is a liere, but this that denyeth that Jhesu is not Crist? This is antecrist, that denyeth the fadir, and the sone.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>
So ech that denyeth the sone, hath not the fadir; but he that knowlechith the sone, hath also the fadir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>
That thing that ye herden at the bigynnyng, dwelle it in you; for if that thing dwellith in you, which ye herden at the bigynnyng, ye schulen dwelle in the sone and in the fadir.

And now, ye litle sones, dwelle ye in hym, that whanne he schal appere, we haue a trist, and be not confoundid of hym in his comyng.

If ye witen that he is iust, wite ye that also ech that doith riytwisnesse, is borun of hym.

And ech man that hath this hope in hym, makith hym silf hooli, as he is hooli.

Ech man that doith synne, doith also wickidnesse, and synne is wickidnesse.

And ye witen, that he apperide to do awei synnes, and synne is not in hym.

Ech man that dwellith in hym, synneth not; and ech that synneth, seeth not hym, nether knew hym.

Litle sones, no man disseyue you; he that doith riytwysnesse, is iust, as also he is iust.
</verse>

He that doith synne, is of the deuel; for the deuel synneth fro the bigynnyng. In this thing the sone of God apperide, that he vndo the werkis of the deuel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>
Ech man that is borun of God, doith not synne; for the seed of God dwellith in hym, and he may not do synne, for he is borun of God.

In this thing the sones of God ben knowun, and the sones of the feend. Ech man that is not iust, is not of God, and he that loueth not his brothir.
