The wordis of Ecclesiastes, sone of Dauid, the kyng of Jerusalem.

The vanyte of vanytees, seide Ecclesiastes; the vanyte of vanytees, and alle thingis ben vanite.
</verse>

What hath a man more of alle his trauel, bi which he traueilith vndur the sunne?
</verse>

Generacioun passith awei, and generacioun cometh; but the erthe stondith with outen ende.
</verse>

The sunne risith, and goith doun, and turneth ayen to his place;

and there it risith ayen, and cumpassith bi the south, and turneth ayen to the north. The spirit cumpassynge alle thingis goith `in cumpas, and turneth ayen in to hise cerclis.
</verse>

Alle floodis entren in to the see, and the see fletith not ouer the markis set of God; the floodis turnen ayen to the place fro whennus tho comen forth, that tho flowe eft.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>
Alle thingis ben hard; a man may not declare tho thingis bi word; the iye is not fillid bi siyt, nether the eere is fillid bi hering.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>
What is that thing that was, that that schal come? What is that thing that is maad, that that schal be maad?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>
No thing vndir the sunne is newe, nether ony man may seie, Lo! this thing is newe; for now it yede bifore in worldis, that weren bifore vs.
</verse>

Mynde of the formere thingis is not, but sotheli nether thenkyng of tho thingis, that schulen come afterward, schal be at hem that schulen come in the last tyme.

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>
I Ecclesiastes was king of Israel in Jerusalem;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>
and Y purposide in my soule to seke and enserche wiseli of alle thingis, that ben maad vndur the sunne. God yaf this werste ocupacioun to the sones of men, that thei schulden be ocupied therynne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>
I siy alle thingis that ben maad vndur the sunne, and lo! alle thingis ben vanyte and turment of spirit.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>
Weiward men ben amendid of hard; and the noumbre of foolis is greet with outen ende.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>
I spak in myn herte, and Y seide, Lo! Y am made greet, and Y passide in wisdom alle men, that weren bifore me in Jerusalem; and my soule siy many thingis wiseli, and Y lernede.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>
And Y yaf myn herte, that Y schulde knowe prudence and doctryn, and errours and foli. And Y knew that in these thingis also was trauel and turment of spirit;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>
for in myche wisdom is myche indignacioun, and he that encressith kunnyng, encreessith also trauel.

        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>
Therfor Y seide in myn hertez, Y schal go, and Y schal flowe in delicis, and Y schal vse goodis; and Y siy also that this was vanyte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>
And leiyyng Y arrettide errour, and Y seide to ioye, What art thou disseyued in veyn?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>
I thouyte in myn herte to withdrawe my fleisch fro wyn, that Y schulde lede ouer my soule to wisdom, and that Y schulde eschewe foli, til Y schulde se, what were profitable to the sones of men; in which dede the noumbre of daies of her lijf vndur the sunne is nedeful.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>
Y magnefiede my werkis, Y bildide housis to me, and Y plauntide vynes; Y made yerdis and orcherdis,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>
and Y settide tho with the trees of al kynde;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>
and Y made cisternes of watris, for to watre the wode of trees growynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>
I hadde in possessioun seruauntis and handmaidis; and Y hadde myche meynee, and droues of grete beestis, and grete flockis of scheep, ouer alle men that weren bifore me in Jerusalem.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>
Y gaderide togidere to me siluer and gold, and the castels of kingis and of prouyncis; Y made to me syngeris and syngeressis, and delicis of the sones of men, and cuppis and vessels in seruyce, to helde out wynes;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>
and Y passide in richessis alle men, that weren bifor me in Jerusalem. Also wisdom dwellide stabli with me,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>
and alle thingis whiche myn iyen desiriden, Y denyede not to hem; nether Y refreynede myn herte, that ne it vside al lust, and delitide it silf in these thingis whiche I hadde maad redi; and Y demyde this my part, if Y vside my trauel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>
And whanne Y hadde turned me to alle werkis whiche myn hondys hadden maad, and to the trauels in whiche Y hadde swet in veyn, Y siy in alle thingis vanyte and turment of the soule, and that no thing vndir sunne dwellith stabli.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>
I passide to biholde wisdom, errours, and foli; Y seide, What is a man, that he may sue the king, his maker?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>
And Y siy, that wisdom yede so mych bifor foli, as miche as liyt is dyuerse fro derknessis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>
The iyen of a wijs man ben in his heed, a fool goith in derknessis; and Y lernede, that o perisching was of euer either.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>
And Y seide in myn herte, If o deth schal be bothe of the fool and of me, what profitith it to me, that Y yaf more bisynesse to wisdom? And Y spak with my soule, and perseyuede, that this also was vanyte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>
For mynde of a wijs man schal not be, in lijk maner as nether of a fool with outen ende, and tymes to comynge schulen hile alle thingis togidere with foryetyng; a lerned man dieth in lijk maner and an vnlerned man.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>
And therfor it anoiede me of my lijf, seynge that alle thingis vndur sunne ben yuele, and that alle thingis ben vanyte and turment of the spirit.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>
Eft Y curside al my bisynesse, bi which Y trauelide moost studiousli vndur sunne, and Y schal haue an eir after me,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>
whom Y knowe not, whether he schal be wijs ether a fool; and he schal be lord in my trauels, for whiche Y swatte greetli, and was bisi; and is ony thing so veyn?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>
Wherfor Y ceesside, and myn herte forsook for to trauele ferthere vnder sunne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>
For whi whanne another man trauelith in wisdom, and techyng, and bisynesse, he leeueth thingis getun to an idel man; and therfor this is vanyte, and greet yuel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>
For whi what schal it profite to a man of al his trauel, and turment of spirit, bi which he was turmentid vndur sunne?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>
Alle hise daies ben ful of sorewis and meschefs, and bi nyyt he restith not in soule; and whether this is not vanyte?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>
Whether it is not betere to ete and drynke, and to schewe to hise soule goodis of hise trauels? and this thing is of the hond of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>
Who schal deuoure so, and schal flowe in delicis, as Y dide?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>
God yaf wisdom, and kunnyng, and gladnesse to a good man in his siyt; but he yaf turment, and superflu bisynesse to a synnere, that he encreesse, and gadere togidere, and yyue to hym that plesith God; but also this is vanyte, and veyn bisynesse of soule.

I siy the turment, which God yaf to the sones of men, that thei be occupied therynne.

God made alle thingis good in her tyme, and yaf the world to disputyng of hem, that a man fynde not the werk which God hath wrouyt fro the bigynnyng `til in to the ende.

And Y knew that no thing was betere `to a man, `no but to be glad, and to do good werkis in his lijf.

For whi ech man that etith and drinkith, and seeth good of his trauel; this is the yifte of God.

That thing that is maad, dwellith perfitli; tho thingis that schulen come, weren bifore; and God restorith that, that is goon.

Therfor oon is the perisching of man and of beestis, and euene condicioun is of euer eithir; as a man dieth, `so and tho beestis dien; alle beestis brethen in lijk maner, and a man hath no thing more than a beeste.
