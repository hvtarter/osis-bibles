Which whanne also he is the briytnesse of glorie, and figure of his substaunce, and berith alle thingis bi word of his vertu, he makith purgacioun of synnes, and syttith on the riythalf of the maieste in heuenes;

For to whiche of the aungels seide God ony tyme, Thou art my sone, Y haue gendrid thee to dai? And eftsoone, Y schal be to hym in to a fadir, and he schal be to me in to a sone?
</verse>

And whanne eftsoone he bryngith in the firste bigetun sone in to the world, he seith, And alle the aungels of God worschipe hym.
</verse>

But he seith to aungels, He that makith hise aungels spiritis, and hise mynystris flawme of fier.

But to the sone he seith, God, thi trone is in to the world of world; a yerde of equite is the yerde of thi rewme;

thou hast louyd riytwisnesse, and hatidist wickidnesse; therfor the God, thi God, anoyntide thee with oile of ioye, more than thi felowis.

And, Thou, Lord, in the bigynnyng foundidist the erthe, and heuenes ben werkis of thin hondis; thei schulen perische,

But to whiche of the aungels seide God at ony tyme, Sitte thou on my riythalf, till Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?

Therfor more plenteuousli it bihoueth vs to kepe tho thingis, that we han herd, lest perauenture we fleten awei.

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>
For if the ilke word that was seid bi aungels, was maad sad, and ech brekyng of the lawe and vnobedience took iust retribucioun of meede,

For God witnesside to gidere bi myraclis, and wondris, and grete merueilis, and dyuerse vertues, and departyngis of the Hooli Goost, bi his wille.

But not to aungels God sugetide the world that is to comynge, of which we speken.

But sum man witnesside in a place, and seide, What thing is man, that thou art myndeful of hym, or mannus sone, for thou visitist hym?

Thou hast maad hym a litil lesse than aungels; thou hast corowned hym with glorie and onour; and thou hast ordeyned him on the werkis of thin hondis.

        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>
Thou hast maad alle thingis suget vndur hise feet. And in that that he sugetide alle thingis to hym, he lefte no thing vnsuget to him. But now we seen not yit alle thingis suget to hym;
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>
but we seen hym that was maad a litil lesse than aungels, Jhesu, for the passioun of deth crowned with glorie and onour, that he thorouy grace of God schulde taste deth for alle men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>
For it bisemede hym, for whom alle thingis, and bi whom `alle thingis weren maad, which hadde brouyt many sones into glorie, and was auctour of the heelthe of hem, that he hadde an ende bi passioun.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>
For he that halewith, and thei that ben halewid, ben alle of oon; for which cause he is not schamed to clepe hem britheren,

And eftsoone, Y schal be tristnynge in to hym; and eftsoone, Lo! Y and my children, whiche God yaf to me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>
Therfor for children comyneden to fleisch and blood, and he also took part of the same, that bi deth he schulde destrie hym that hadde lordschipe of deth, that is to seie, the deuel,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>
and that he schulde delyuere hem that bi drede of deth, `bi al lijf weren boundun to seruage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>
And he took neuere aungelis, but he took the seed of Abraham.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>
Wherfor he ouyte to be likned to britheren bi alle thingis, that he schulde be maad merciful and a feithful bischop to God, that he schulde be merciful to the trespassis of the puple.

For in that thing in which he suffride, and was temptid, he is miyti to helpe also hem that ben temptid.

        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>
Therfor, hooli britheren, and parceneris of heuenli cleping, biholde ye the apostle and the bischop of oure confessioun, Jhesu,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>
which is trewe to hym that made hym, as also Moises in al the hous of hym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>
But this byschop is had worthi of more glorie than Moises, bi as myche as he hath more honour of the hous, that made the hous.
</verse>

For ech hous is maad of sum man; he that made alle thingis of nouyt is God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>
And Moises was trewe in al his hous, as a seruaunt, in to witnessyng of tho thingis that weren to be seid;

        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>
but Crist as a sone in his hous. Which hous we ben, if we holden sad trist and glorie of hope in to the ende.

Wherfor as the Hooli Goost seith, To dai, if ye han herd his vois, nyle ye hardne youre hertis,

Wherfor Y was wrooth to this generacioun, and Y seide, Euere more thei erren in herte, for thei knewen not my weies;

Britheren, se ye, lest perauenture in ony of you be an yuel herte of vnbileue, to departe fro the lyuynge God.

        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>
But moneste you silf bi alle daies, the while to dai is named, that noon of you be hardned bi fallas of synne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>
For we ben maad parceneris of Crist, if netheles we holden the bigynnyng of his substaunce sad in to the ende.
</verse>

While it is seid, to dai, if ye han herd the vois of hym, nyle ye hardne youre hertis, as in that wraththing.

For summen heringe wraththiden, but not alle thei that wenten out of Egipt bi Moises.

But to whiche was he wraththid fourti yeeris? Whether not to hem that synneden, whos careyns weren cast doun in desert?

And to whiche swoor he, that thei schulden not entre in to the reste of hym, not but to hem that weren vnbileueful?

And we seen, that thei myyten not entre in to the reste of hym for vnbileue.

Therfor drede we, lest perauenture while the biheest of entryng in to his reste is left, that ony of vs be gessid to be awei.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>
For it is told also to vs, as to hem. And the word that was herd profitide not to hem, not meynd to feith of tho thingis that thei herden.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>
For we that han bileued, schulen entre in to reste, as he seide, As Y swoor in my wraththe, thei schulen not entre in to my reste. And whanne the werkis weren maad perfit at the ordynaunce of the world,
</verse>

he seide thus in a place of the seuenthe dai, And God restide in the seuenthe dai from alle hise werkis.

And in this place eftsoone, Thei schulen not entre in to my reste.

Therfor for it sueth, that summen schulen entre in to it, and thei to whiche it was teld to bifor, entriden not for her vnbileue.

Eftsoone he termyneth sum dai, and seith in Dauith, To dai, aftir so myche tyme of tyme, as it is biforseid, To dai if ye han herd his vois, nyle ye hardne youre hertis.

For if Jhesus hadde youun reste to hem, he schulde neuere speke of othere aftir this dai.

Therfor the sabat is left to the puple of God.

For he that is entrid in to his reste, restide of hise werkis, as also God of hise.

Therfor haste we to entre in to that reste, that no man falle in to the same ensaumple of vnbileue. For the word of God is quyk,

And no creature is vnuisible in the siyt of God. For alle thingis ben nakid and opyn to hise iyen, to whom a word to vs.

Therfor we that han a greet bischop, that perside heuenes, Jhesu, the sone of God, holde we the knoulechyng of oure hope.

For we han not a bischop, that may not haue compassioun on oure infirmytees, but was temptid bi alle thingis bi lycnesse, with oute synne.

Therfor go we with trist to the trone of his grace, that we gete merci, and fynde grace in couenable help.

Nethir ony man taketh to hym onour, but he that is clepid of God, as Aaron was.
