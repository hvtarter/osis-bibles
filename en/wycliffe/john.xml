In the bigynnyng was the word, and the word was at God, and God was the word.

This was in the bigynnyng at God.

Alle thingis weren maad bi hym, and withouten hym was maad no thing, that thing that was maad.

In hym was lijf, and the lijf was the liyt of men; and the liyt schyneth in derknessis,

A man was sent fro God, to whom the name was Joon.

This man cam in to witnessyng, that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt, that alle men schulden bileue bi hym.

He was not the liyt, but that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt.

There was a very liyt, which liytneth ech man that cometh in to this world.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>
He was in the world, and the world was maad bi hym, and the world knew hym not.

He cam in to his owne thingis, and hise resseyueden hym not.

But hou many euer resseyueden hym, he yaf to hem power to be maad the sones of God, to hem that bileueden in his name; the whiche not of bloodis,

And the word was maad man, and dwellyde among vs, and we han seyn the glorie of hym, as the glorie of the `oon bigetun sone of the fadir, ful of grace and of treuthe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>
Joon berith witnessyng of hym, and crieth, and seith, This is, whom Y seide, He that schal come aftir me, is maad bifore me, for he was tofor me;

and of the plente of hym we alle han takun, and grace for grace.

And this is the witnessyng of Joon, whanne Jewis senten fro Jerusalem prestis and dekenes to hym, that thei schulden axe hym, Who art thou?

Therfor thei seiden to hym, Who art thou? that we yyue an answere to these that senten vs. What seist thou of thi silf?

He seide, Y am a vois of a crier in deseert, Dresse ye the weie of the Lord, as Ysaie, the prophete, seide.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>
And thei that weren sent, weren of the Fariseis.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>
And thei axiden hym, and seiden to hym, What thanne baptisist thou, if thou art not Crist, nether Elie, nether a profete?
</verse>

Joon answeride to hem, and seide, Y baptise in watir, but in the myddil of you hath stonde oon, that ye knowen not;

These thingis weren don in Bethanye biyende Jordan, where Joon was baptisyng.

This is he, that Y seide of, Aftir me is comun a man, which was maad bifor me; for he was rather than Y.

And Y knew hym not, but that he be schewid in Israel, therfor Y cam baptisynge in watir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>
And Joon bar witnessyng, and seide, That Y saiy the spirit comynge doun as a culuer fro heuene, and dwellide on hym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>
And Y knew hym not; but he that sente me to baptise in watir, seide to me, On whom thou seest the Spirit comynge doun, and dwellynge on hym, this is he, that baptisith in the Hooli Goost.

And Andrewe, the brother of Symount Petir, was oon of the tweyne, that herden of Joon, and hadden sued hym.

And on the morewe he wolde go out in to Galilee, and he foond Filip; and he seith to hym, Sue thou me.

And whanne wijn failide, the modir of Jhesu seide to hym, Thei han not wijn.

Jhesus dide this the bigynnyng of signes in the Cane of Galilee, and schewide his glorie; and hise disciplis bileueden in hym.

Aftir these thingis he cam doun to Cafarnaum, and his modir, and hise britheren, and hise disciplis; and thei dwelliden `there not many daies.

And the pask of Jewis was nyy, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem.

And he foond in the temple men sillynge oxun, and scheep, and culueris, and chaungeris sittynge.

Therfor the Jewis seiden to hym, In fourti and sixe yeer this temple was bildid, and schalt thou in thre daies reise it?

But he seide of the temple of his bodi.

And there was a man of the Farisees, Nychodeme bi name, a prince of the Jewis.

And he cam to Jhesu bi niyt, and seide to hym, Rabi, we witen, that thou art comun fro God maister; for no man may do these signes, that thou doist, but God be with hym.

Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen, he may not se the kyngdom of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>
Nychodeme seide to hym, Hou may a man be borun, whanne he is eeld? whether he may entre ayen in to his modris wombe, and be borun ayen?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>
Jhesus answeride, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen of watir, and of the Hooli Goost, he may not entre in to the kyngdom of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>
`That that is borun of the fleisch, is fleisch; and `that that is borun of spirit, is spirit.

Wondre thou not, for Y seide to thee, It bihoueth you to be borun ayen.

The spirit brethith where he wole, and thou herist his vois, but thou wost not, fro whennus he cometh, ne whidir he goith; so is ech man that is borun of the spirit.

Nychodeme answeride, and seide to hym, Hou moun these thingis be don?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>
Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou art a maister in Israel, and knowist not these thingis?
</verse>

Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, for we speken that that we witen, and we witnessen that that we han seyn, and ye taken not oure witnessyng.

And no man stieth in to heuene, but he that cam doun fro heuene, mannys sone that is in heuene.

And as Moises areride a serpent in desert, so it bihoueth mannys sone to be reisid,

For God sente not his sone in to the world, that he iuge the world, but that the world be saued bi him.

        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>
He that bileueth in hym, is not demed; but he that bileueth not, is now demed, for he bileueth not in the name of the `oon bigetun sone of God.
</verse>

And this is the dom, for liyt cam in to the world, and men loueden more derknessis than liyt; for her werkes weren yuele.

For ech man that doith yuele, hatith the liyt; and he cometh not to the liyt, that hise werkis be not repreued.

But he that doith treuthe, cometh to the liyt, that hise werkis be schewid, that thei ben don in God.

Aftir these thingis Jhesus cam, and hise disciplis, in to the loond of Judee, and there he dwellide with hem, and baptiside.

Ye you silf beren witnessyng to me, that Y seide, Y am not Crist, but that Y am sent bifore hym.

And he witnessith that thing that he hath seie, and herde, and no man takith his witnessing.
