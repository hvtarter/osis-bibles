        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to [the] faith of the elect of God and [the] full knowledge of [the] truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time [itself],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but has in due time manifested His word in a proclamation, [with ]which I was entrusted according to the command of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, [my ]own son according to [our] common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this reason I left you behind in Crete, so that you should set in order the things[ ]that are lacking, and you should appoint elders in every city as I commanded you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if a man is unimpeachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or [who are ]insubordinate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be unimpeachable, as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable, loving good, prudent, just, holy, temperate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast to the faithful word as he was taught, that he may be able to exhort by sound doctrine, and to convince those who oppose it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are also many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whom it is necessary to shut [their] mouths, who overturn whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>There said a certain one of them, a prophet of their own, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish myths and to commands of men turning away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>All things indeed are pure to the pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience have been defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but in their works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But you speak the[ ]things which suit sound doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>Older men are to be sober, serious, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>Older women likewise are to be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teaching what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>so that they may urge the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>temperate, pure, homemakers, good, submitting to their own husbands, lest the word of God be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise exhort the young men to be sensible,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in all respects showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, dignity, incorruptibility,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech that cannot be condemned, in order that the [one] who is an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>[Exhort] bondservants to be subject to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not talking back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not embezzling, but showing good faith, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people as [His] own possession, zealous for good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Speak these things, exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to slander no one, to be peaceable, gentle, demonstrating all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, being deceived, being enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works of righteousness which we did, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that having been justified by His grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>Faithful is this word, and concerning these things I want you to strongly affirm, so that those who have believed in God may take thought to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish disputes and genealogies, and strifes and legal fights; for they are unprofitable and futile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a person has been perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>Whenever I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Speedily send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, in order that they may lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, lest they be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All[ ]who [are] with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
