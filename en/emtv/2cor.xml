        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='2Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all our tribulation, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, by means of the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>Because just as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>(And our hope concerning you is steadfast); if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, thus also [you will partake] of the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not desire you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yes, we have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and is delivering [us]; in whom we trust that He will still deliver [us],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you also laboring together for us in prayer, that thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf for the gift [given] to us through many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we have conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we do not write other things to you except what you read or also understand. And I hope that you will understand, even until the end</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>just as also you have understood us in part, that we are your boasting, as indeed you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, that you might have a second benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and through you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent on to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore, when I decided this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I decide, do I decide according to the flesh, that there may be with me "Yes, Yes,"and "No, No?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But [as ]God [is] faithful, our word unto you was not "Yes and no."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us-by me, Silvanus, and Timothy-was not "Yes and no,"but in Him was "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of God in Him [are] "Yes,"and in Him "Amen,"to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now He who establishes us together with you in Christ and who has anointed us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also has sealed us, and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover I call upon God as a witness against my soul, that in order to spare you, I came no more to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad if not the [one] which is made sorrowful by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest when I came, I should have sorrow from those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you might be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part-lest I burden you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a person is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the majority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest somehow such a person be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I appeal to you to reaffirm [your] love towards him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end I also wrote, so that I might put you to the test, [to see] if you are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>And to whom you forgive anything, I also [forgive;] for if indeed I have forgiven anything, [the ]one whom I have forgiven, [I have done so] for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>lest we be taken advantage of by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but saying farewell to them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and making known through us the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are the fragrance of Christ to God among those being saved, and among those perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To some we are the fragrance of death [leading] to death, but to others the fragrance of life [leading] to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as the rest, corrupting the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or [letters] of recommendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter, having been written in our hearts, being known and being read by all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being made known that you are [the] letter of Christ, which was ministered by us, having been written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not in tablets of stone but in tablets of flesh, [namely] in hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And we have such trust through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also has made us efficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of [the] letter but of [the] Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>Now if the ministry of death, having been engraved in letters on stones, came to be with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, the [glory which] [was] passing away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation [had] glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which has been glorified has not been glorified in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which passes away [was] glorious, then that which remains is much more glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore, having such hope, we use great boldness of speech-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the end of what was passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is removed in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not despair,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor falsifying the word of God, but by the disclosure of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But even if our gospel is hidden, it is hidden among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Because it is God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts to give [the] light of the knowledge of the glory of God in [the] face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in clay vessels, so that the extraordinary character of the power may be of God and not of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>in everything being oppressed, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who are living are always handed over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifest in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death is working in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke,"we also believe, therefore we also speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us through Jesus, and will present us together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things[ are] for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not despair, but even if our outward man is being destroyed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light affliction is working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are for a season, but the things which are not seen last forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hand, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For also in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, inasmuch as we do not desire to be stripped, but to put on [clothing], that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now He who has prepared us for this same thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore always being confident, and knowing that while we are in the body, we are away from home from the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(for we walk by faith, not by sight),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>but we are confident and prefer rather to be away from home from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore also we have as our ambition, whether being at home, or being away from home, to be well pleasing to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, in accordance with the things which he did, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we have been made known to God. And I also hope to have been made known in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give to you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have [an answer] for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we were beside ourselves, it [was] for God; or if we are of sound mind, [it is] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ compels us, having concluded this: that if One died for all, then all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and He died for all, so that they who live should live no longer for themselves, but for the [One] who died for them and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him thus] no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of this reconciliation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not reckoning their transgressions to them, and committing to us the word of this reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Now then, we serve as ambassadors for Christ, as though God were appealing through us: we implore [you] on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>And working together [with Him,] we also urge that you not receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you."Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>We give no occasion for offense in anything, lest the ministry be blamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves as ministers of God: in much endurance, in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in disturbances, in labors, in sleepless nights, in fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>through the word of truth, through the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>by honor and dishonor, by ill repute and good repute; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as being unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not being put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart has been opened wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now in return for the same-I speak as to children-you also be opened wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there for righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion is there for light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement is there for Christ with Belial? Or what part is there for a believer with an infidel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what union is there for the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, just as God has said: "I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore "Come out from the midst of them and be separated,"says the Lord. "Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>"I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the LORD Almighty."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us [in your hearts]. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not speak to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my confidence toward you, great is my boasting concerning you. I have been filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side; outside [were] fightings, inside [were] fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted over you, as he reported to us your earnest longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it. For I perceive that the same letter made you sorry, though only for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led to repentance; for you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, without regret; but worldly sorrow produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner, how much diligence it produced in you, even an eagerness to defend, even indignation, even fear, even longing, even zeal, even vengeance! In all things you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Therefore, although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but so that your diligence on our behalf might be made known to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Because of this we have been comforted. And in your comfort we rejoiced exceedingly more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because if in anything I have boasted to him concerning you, I was not put to shame, but as we spoke all things to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus became truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affections are far greater toward you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>[Therefore] I rejoice that in everything I am confident in you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Now we make known to you brothers, the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I bear witness that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>with much appeal, begging us [for ]the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>and not as we hoped, but they first gave their own selves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>so that we urged Titus, that just as he had begun before, thus he would also finish this grace also in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you abound in everything-in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us-see that you abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet on account of you He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And I give [my] opinion in this: For this is profitable for you, who not only previously began doing [this], but also desired to, since last year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>And now also complete doing [it]; that as indeed there[ was ]the readiness to desire [it], thus also there[ may be] the completion from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there is first a readiness, it is acceptable according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I do not [mean] that others should be relieved and you burdened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but by way of equality, that now at the present time your abundance [may supply] their need, that their abundance also may supply your need, in order that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, "He [who ga]there[d] much did not have too much, and he [who gathered] little had no lack."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>Because he accepted my appeal, but being more diligent, he came to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we sent together with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion with this gift, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] our readiness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>avoiding this, lest anyone should blame us in this abundance which is ministered by us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>having regard for honorable things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we sent together with them our brother whom we often approved in many things, being diligent, but now [being ]much more diligent, by [his] great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If [anyone inquires ]about Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow worker concerning you; or if our brothers [are inquired about], [they are] messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show to them the proof of your love, and of our boasting concerning you, before the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>for I know your readiness, about which I boast concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has provoked the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>And I have sent the brothers, lest our boasting about you lose its justification in this matter, that just as I said, you may be prepared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest perhaps if [some] Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to urge the brothers, that they should go before [me] to you, and should arrange in advance your generous gift, which you had previously promised, [that] this would be ready, thus as a blessing and not as grudgingly given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this I say: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let each [one give] just as he decides in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>just as it is written: "He has dispersed, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>in everything being made rich to all generosity, which produces thanksgiving through us to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>Because the ministry of this service not only is supplying the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>while through the approved character of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and [for the] generosity of your sharing toward them and toward all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I, Paul, myself appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who face to face [am] lowly among you, but when I am away am bold toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I beseech [you] that when I am present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I plan to be bold toward some, who consider us as walking according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty by God to the pulling down of strongholds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and being ready to avenge every act of disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look at things as they appear? If anyone has persuaded himself that he is Christ's, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ's, even so we are Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I should boast somewhat more concerning our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>lest I seem to terrify you by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>"For his letters,"they say, "are severe and boisterous, but his bodily presence [is] feeble, and his speech amounts to nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person consider this, that of what sort we are in word by letters when we are absent, of such a kind [we will] also [be] in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not to class ourselves or to compare ourselves with those who commend themselves, but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast beyond limits, but according to the measure of the sphere [of influence ]which God assigned us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though our authority did not reach to you, for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting beyond the limits in the labors of others, but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you according to our sphere [of influence],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to preach the gospel to the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in the things done in the sphere [of influence] of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But "he who boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved, but he[ ]whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>Oh, that you would bear with me a little in my foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest perhaps as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if he who comes [to you ]preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you may well put up with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider [myself] [in] nothing to have been inferior to the most super apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if I [am] unskilled in speech, yet [I am] not [inferior ]in knowledge, but in every [way] I was made known to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit sin in humbling myself in order that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches, taking wages [from them] to minister to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>and when I was present with you, and in need, I did not burden anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. And in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and so I will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I am doing, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast they may be found just as we [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, let no one think me a fool. Otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you bear with fools gladly, being wise [yourselves]!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes from you, if someone exalts himself, if someone strikes you in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>To our shame, I say that we were too weak [for that]! But in whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] even more: in labors far more, in beatings immeasurably, in imprisonments far more, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>By [the] Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have spent in the depth [of the sea].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in labor and hardship, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>apart from what I leave unmentioned, what comes against me daily: the anxiety for all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn [with indignation]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must boast, I will boast about the things concerning my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>It is indeed not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago-whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows-such a one was caught up to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man-whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not permitted for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Concerning such a one I will boast, but concerning myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I should desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak [the] truth. But I spare [you], lest anyone consider me to be beyond what he sees me [to be] or hears something from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And lest I exalt myself above measure by the excellence of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, that it might beat me, lest I exalt myself above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness."Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me! For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing have I been inferior to the super apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Now for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not burden you. For I do not seek what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I gladly will spend and be expended for your souls; although the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I took you with guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I urged Titus, and I sent with him the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did [we] not [walk] in the same Spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do you think that we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I am afraid, lest perhaps when I come, I will not find you as I desire, and that I will be found by you as you do not desire; lest perhaps there[ be] contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, disputes, slanders, gossipings, pride, disorders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest, when I come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn for many who have previously sinned and have not repented for the impurity and fornication and lewdness which they practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This [will be] the third time I am coming to you. "By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have previously said, and I say beforehand, as being present the second [time], and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare [you,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since you are seeking proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but strong in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For although He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Scrutinize yourselves as to whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you are reprobates?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is honorable, though we may be as reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we can do nothing against the truth, but on behalf of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Because of this I write these things being absent, in order that when I am present I may not deal sharply with you, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally brothers, farewell. Restore [yourselves,] comfort [yourselves], be in agreement, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</verse>
