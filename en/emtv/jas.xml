        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>But let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it shall be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he that doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Let the lowly brother rejoice in his exaltation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>but the rich [man ]in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun arose with burning heat and withered the grass, and its flower fell off, and its beautiful appearance perished. So the rich man also shall fade away in his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man who endures temptation; because when he is approved, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But each [one] is tempted by his own lusts, being drawn away and being seduced [by them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then lust, when it conceives, gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Exercising His will He begat us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>So then, my beloved brothers, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore laying aside all filthiness and abundance of evil, in meekness receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this [one] is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>for he observed himself and has gone away, and immediately forgot what sort of [man] he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But the [one] who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one shall be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceiving his heart, the religion of this [man ]is useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure and undefiled religion before God and [the] Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if a man enters into your assembly with a gold ring, in fine clothes, and there should also come in a poor [man] in dirty clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you have respect for him that wears the fine clothes and you say to him, "You sit here in a good seat,"and say to the poor man, "You stand there,"or, "Sit here under my footstool,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>and so did you not differentiate among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brothers. Did God not choose the poor of the world [to be] rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those that love Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do they not blaspheme the noble name by which you are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself,"you do well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he has become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For He who said, "Do not commit adultery,"also said, "You shall not murder."Now if you do not commit adultery, but [yet ]you murder, [then ]you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment is without mercy to the one who does not show mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What does it profit, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Is that [kind of] faith able to save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled,"but you do not give them the necessary things of the body, what [is] the benefit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Thus also that faith, if it does not have works, is dead, [being] by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works."Show me your faith [apart] from your works, and I will show you my faith by means of my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe God is one. You do well. Even the demons believe-and they shudder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by means of his works faith was made perfect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."And he was called a friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by means of works, when she received the messengers and sent [them] out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>My brothers, let not many become teachers, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For we all stumble in many [ways]. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a mature man, able also to bridle the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Consider that we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Consider also the ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the pilot desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>Even so the tongue is a small member and it boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Thus the tongue is set among our members, as that which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every kind of both beasts and birds, of both reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But no man can tame the tongue. [It] is an unrestrainable evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are created according to [the] likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth come blessings and curses. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>The spring does not pour forth from the same opening [both ]the sweet and the bitter [water, does it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>It is not possible, my brothers, [for] a fig tree to make olives, or a vine [to make ]figs, [is it]? Thus no spring is able to produce [both] salt and sweet water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Is there anyone wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct [that] his works [are] in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where jealousy and strife [exist], there unrest and every evil deed [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those making peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>From where [come] wars and disputes among you? Is it not from here, from your lusts, which war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You lust and you do not have. You murder and are jealous and you cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend [it] in [gratifying] your lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [you] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [you] double-minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter change into mourning and your joy into dejection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. He who speaks evil against a brother and judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. And if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you who judges the other?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, you who say, "Today and tomorrow let us travel to this city, and let us spend a year there, and let us trade and make a profit"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>[you] who do not know [what will] happen tomorrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appears for a little [time], but then also disappears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do [it], to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Listen now, you rich, weep and howl at your miseries which are coming upon you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches have decayed, and your garments have become moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver have become corroded, and their poison will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Indeed, the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, which were kept back by you, cry out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You lived luxuriously upon the earth and you lived riotously, you nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned; you have murdered the just[. ]He does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer awaits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, until it receives the early and late rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Do not murmur against one another, brothers, lest you be judged. Behold, the Judge stands before the doors!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>My brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of evil suffering and of longsuffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Indeed we count those blessed who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you saw the end of the Lord-that He is compassionate and He is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven nor the earth, nor any other oath. But let your "Yes"be "Yes,"and [your] "No,""No,"so that you may not fall into hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Does anyone among you suffer misfortune? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call on the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And the prayer of faith will save the [one ]who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess your transgressions to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of the righteous is very powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of similar nature to us, and with a prayer, he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brothers, if anyone among you wanders away from the truth, and anyone turns him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
