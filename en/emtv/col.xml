        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by [the] will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>when we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love which is towards all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope being laid up for you in [the] heavens, in which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which has come to you, just as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit and growing, just as also among you, from the day which you heard and fully knew the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>just as also you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>On account of this we also, since the day we heard, do not cease praying for you, and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that you should walk worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit and increasing in the full knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>being strengthened with all power, according to the might of His glory, for all endurance and longsuffering with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>because by Him all things were created, those in the heavens and those on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And He is before all things, and in Him all things are held together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in all things He may have the preeminence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>for it pleased [the Father that] in Him all the fullness should dwell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on the earth or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach before Him-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if indeed you continue in the faith, having been founded and firm and not drifting away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was proclaimed to all creation under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for His body, which is the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from generations, but now was revealed to His saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we proclaim, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>for which I also labor, striving according to His working which is working in me with power.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have concerning you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be encouraged, being joined together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to a full knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>Now this I say lest anyone may deceive you with persuasive words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderliness and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>having been rooted and built up in Him and being established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest anyone captures you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and you are completed in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In whom you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and He has taken it out of the midst, nailing it to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>[And h]aving disarmed principalities and powers, He mocked them in public, triumphing over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Therefore do not let anyone judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or of a new moon or of sabbaths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one rule against you, desiring [to do so] in [false] humility and in worship of the angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, in vain being puffed up by his carnal mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, supported and joined together by joints and ligaments, grows with the growth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you submit to regulations-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>"Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>which things are all for corruption with the using, according to the commands and teaching of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and severity [on the] body, but [are] not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at [the] right [hand] of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>Whenever Christ [who is] our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Therefore put to death your members on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>Because of which things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you yourselves are to put off all [these]: wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, since you have stripped off the old man with his practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have put on the new man who is renewed in full knowledge according to the image of Him who created it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is not Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>forbearing one another and forgiving yourselves, if anyone should have a complaint against any; just as Christ forgave you, so you also [do].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you may do in word or deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Bondservants, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever you may do, work [it] from your soul, as to the Lord and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. For you serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But the [one] doing wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is not partiality.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, provide to your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in [the] heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>praying at the same time also for us, that God would open a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, because of which I am also in chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, redeeming the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your word always be with grace, having been seasoned with salt, to know how you ought to answer each [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all things about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I am sending him to you for this very thing, that he may know your circumstances, and he may encourage your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all the things[ happening] here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, receive him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus who is called Justus. These alone are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras greets you, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, always struggling for you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and complete in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I bear him witness that he has much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke the beloved physician greets you, also Demas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And whenever this letter is read before you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the [one] from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>This greeting [is] by my [own] hand-Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
