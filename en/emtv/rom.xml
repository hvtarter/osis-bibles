        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called [to be ]an apostle, having been separated unto the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning His Son, who came of [the] seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was declared Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection of [the] dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>through whom we received grace and apostleship for [the ]obedience of faith among all the nations for His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>requesting if somehow now at sometime I shall succeed in the will of God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that I may be encouraged together with you through the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I planned to come to you (and I was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to [the ]wise and to [the ]unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes, both to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it [the] righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which is known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown [it] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of[ ]the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things made, both His eternal power and divinity, so that they are without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, having known God, they did not glorify [Him] as God, or give thanks, but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Asserting themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for a likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of the own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this reason God gave them up to shameful lusts, for even their women exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and likewise also the men, having forsaken the natural use of the woman, were inflamed by their lust for one another, men with men, committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And just as they did not approve to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do the things which are not fitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness; they are whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>slanderers, haters of God, insolent men, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who, having known the righteous judgment of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also approve of those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, everyone who judges, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself, for you who judge are practicing the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those practicing such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>But do you suppose this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things yet doing them, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will recompense to each one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who by the endurance of good works are seeking glory and honor and incorruption-eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to those who are contentious, and who disobey the truth, but obey unrighteousness-indignation and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that works evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory, honor, and peace to everyone that works good, both to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For all who have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(for [it is ]not the hearers of the law [who ]are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>for whenever Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience witnessing with [them], and among themselves their thoughts accuse or even defend [them]),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, you are called a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know His will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and are convinced that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say, "Do not commit adultery,"do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God through the transgression of the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,"just as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For indeed circumcision profits if you keep the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And will not the physically uncircumcised, who keeps the law, judge you along with your written [code] and circumcision, as a lawbreaker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he [is] a Jew that [is one] inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in [the] spirit, not in [the ]letter, whose praise is not from men but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then [is] the superiority of the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way! First of all, that they were entrusted with the [very ]words of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>By no means! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar, just as it is written: "That You may be justified in Your words, and You may prevail when You are judged."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Surely] God, the [One ]inflicting wrath is not unrighteous, is [He]? (I speak as a man).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>By no means! For otherwise how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if by my lie the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why not say, "Let us do evil so that good may come"?-just as we are slandered, and just as some affirm that we say. [The] judgment of whom is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we [any] better? Not at all. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>Just as it is written: "There is none righteous, no not one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none who understands; there is none who seeks God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All [have ]turned aside; together they became unprofitable; there is not [one] doing kindness, there is not so much as one."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>"Their throat is an opened grave; with their tongues they deceived"; "[the ]poison of asps is under their lips";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Ruin and misery are in their ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace they did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that as many things as the law says, it speaks to those under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore by works of the law no flesh shall be justified in His sight, for through the law [comes] [the] knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law has been revealed, being witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even the righteousness of God, through [the] faithfulness of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all those that believe. For there is no distinction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, for a demonstration of His righteousness through the passing over of the sins having previously committed, in the forbearance of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for a demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, that He might be just and the justifier of he who has [the] faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is He the God of the Jews only? But is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since there is one God who will justify [the ]circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Therefore do we nullify the law through faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold [the] law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has [grounds for] boasting, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him who works, his wage is not reckoned as a gift, but as his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>"Blessed [are] [they] whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall by no means impute sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does this blessing then come upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had while ]in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all those that believe, although uncircumcised, so that righteousness should also be imputed to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father of circumcision to those not only of circumcision, but also to those following in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham[ had while] in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through [the] law, but through [the] righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of [the] law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been nullified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>because the law produces wrath; for where there is no law neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith that it may be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those[ ]of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(just as it is written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations") before God, whom he believed, the [One] who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>who, contrary to hope, on hope believed, so that he should become a father of many nations, according to what was spoken, "So shall your descendants be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not weakening in faith, he did not consider his own body, already having been worn out (being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>he did not waver at the promise of God in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore "it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for us also, to whom it was going to be credited, those believing on Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up for our transgressions, and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only that, but we also rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and endurance, character; and character, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope does not put to shame, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For while we were still weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely on behalf of a righteous [man] will anyone die; yet perhaps for a good man someone might even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death passed to all men, because all sinned-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one man many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the gift is not as by one having sinned. For the judgment [which came] from one [transgression resulted] in condemnation, but the free gift from many offenses [brought ] justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the transgression of the one man death reigned through the one [man], much more those receiving the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>So then, as through one [man's] transgression [judgment came] to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one [Man's] righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For through the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But [the] law came in alongside, so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace superabounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>By no means! We died to sin-How shall we live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know that as many [of us] as were baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be [in the likeness] of [His] resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man was crucified [with Him], so that the body of sin may be done away with, [that] we should no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who has died has been justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live together with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies. Death is no longer master [over] Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For what [death] He died, He died to sin once for all; but what [life] He lives, He lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise you also, consider yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>nor present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to whom you obey, whether of sin [resulting] in death, or of obedience [resulting] in righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that though you used to be slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from [your] heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak in human terms on account of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to lawlessness [resulting] in [more] lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness [resulting] in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>So what fruit did you have then of which [things] you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now having been freed from sin, and having become enslaved to God, you have your fruit [resulting] in sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or do you not know, brothers (for I speak to those knowing the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman who is under a man has been bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband should die, she is released from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then, while the husband is living, she will be called an adulteress if she becomes [married] to a different husband; but if her husband should die, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, having become [married] to a different husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another-to Him who was raised from the dead, so that we might bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused through the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we were released from the law, having died in [that] to which we were held fast, so that we should serve as slaves in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known lust unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of lust. For apart from the law sin [was] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment, which [was] to [bring] life, I found to [bring] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, deceived me, and by it, killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Then has that which is good become death to me? By no means! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through that which is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For what I am doing, I do not know. For what I want to do, I do not do; but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now [it is] no longer I [who] am doing it, but the sin living in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but [how] to do the good, I do not find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I want to do I do not do; but the evil I do not want to do, this I practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I [who] do it, but the sin living in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>Therefore I find this law, that [when] I wish to do the right[ thing], evil is right there with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see a different law in my members, waging war against the law of my mind, and capturing me by the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with the mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>[There is] therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what [was] impossible [for] the law to do in that it was weak through the flesh, God [did] by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and concerning sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are fleshly set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those [who live] according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not submit to the law of God, nor indeed can it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>And those that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit indwelling in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brothers, we are debtors-not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live according to the flesh you shall die; but if by [the] Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again unto fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs-heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together, so that we may also be glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the unveiling of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>because even the creation itself shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that all the creation groans together and labors in birth together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only that, but also [we ]ourselves having the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For by this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he[ ]sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it with endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But He that searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes on behalf of the saints according to [the will] [of] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to [His ]purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>Because whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who [can be] against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up on behalf of us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that condemns? Christ is the [One] having died, but rather also having been raised, who is even at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>Just as it is written: "For Your sake we are put to death the whole day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height nor depth, nor anything else in creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience witnessing with me in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could wish that I myself to be accursed from Christ on behalf of my brothers, my countrymen according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>who are Israelites, of whom are the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the worship, and the promises;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>of whom are the fathers and from whom Christ [came], according to the flesh, He who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all those of Israel [are of] Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>nor [are they] all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, "In Isaac your seed shall be called."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but [it is ]the children of the promise that are regarded as descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only this, but also Rebecca having conception from one [man], our father Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>for [the children] not yet being born, nor having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works but of Him who calls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>it was said to her, "The older shall serve the younger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What shall we say then? [Is ]there unrighteousness with God? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God who shows mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>But indeed, O man, who are you to [be ]answering back against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, "Why have you made me like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Or does not the potter have the right over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and the other for dishonor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>But what if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>and so that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>even us whom He called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As also in Hosea He says: "I will call those My people who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>"And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the sons of Israel were as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>For He is finishing and cutting short an account in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short account upon the earth."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Why? Because [they did] not [seek it] by faith, but rather by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stone of stumbling.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brothers, the good pleasure of my heart and my supplication to God on behalf of Israel, is for [their] salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I testify concerning them, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For they, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of [the] law for righteousness to everyone that believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes about the righteousness which [is] of the law, "That the man who does those things shall live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness of faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who shall ascend into heaven?' "(that is, to bring Christ down)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"(that is, the word of faith which we proclaim):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and you believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For "whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then shall they call on Him in[ ]whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear apart from a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, of those preaching the gospel of good things!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So then faith [comes] by hearing, and hearing by [the] word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, have they not heard? Yes, indeed [they have]: "Their voice went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: "I will provoke you to jealousy by [those who are] not a nation, by a foolish nation I will anger you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But Isaiah is very bold and says: "I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But to Israel he says: "the whole day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I say then, has God cast away His people? By no means! For I too am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know [what the Scripture says] in Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>"LORD, they killed Your prophets and they torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what does the divine response say to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So to then, at this present time, there is also a remnant according to the election of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>And if by grace, [it is] no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if [it is ]of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained [it], and the rest were blinded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>Just as it is written: "God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, down to this very day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David says: "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a recompense to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? By no means! But by their transgression, salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>But if their transgression is [the] riches of the world, and their defeat is [the] riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if somehow I may provoke to jealousy my fellow Jews, and I may save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if their casting away means reconciliation [for the] world, what will their acceptance be, if not life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>For if the firstfruit is holy, [so] also the lump; and if the root is holy, so also the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in [among] them, and became a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>do not be arrogant towards the branches. But if you are arrogant, [remember] that it is not you that supports the root, but the root [supports] you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>That is true. By unbelief they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He may not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold then the kindness and severity of God: upon those that fell, severity; but upon you, kindness, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these, the natural ones, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, lest you be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer shall come out of Zion, and He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>For this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As regards to the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sake; but as regards to election, [they are] beloved for the sake of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now you were shown mercy through their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>even so these now were disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they also might be shown mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He might show mercy to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and[ ]knowledge of God! How unsearchable [are] His judgments and untraceable [are ]His ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>"For who has known [the] mind of the LORD? Or who has been His counselor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>"Or who has first given to Him, and it shall be repaid to him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of Him and through Him and to Him [are] all things; to Him [be] the glory forever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>Therefore, brothers, I exhort you through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, [which is] your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and well pleasing and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself too highly, beyond what you should think, but to think soberly, as God has imparted to each one a measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For just as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having then gifts differing according to the grace having been given to us, [let us use them]: whether prophecy, [let us prophecy] according to the proportion of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>whether ministry, [let us use it] in our ministry; whether teaching; in the teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>whether exhorting, in the exhortation; whether sharing, with simplicity; whether leading, with diligence; whether showing mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>[Let] love [be] without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Be warmly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, devoted to prayer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>sharing in the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless those that persecute you; bless and do not curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but [rather ]associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Repay no one evil for evil; providing that which is good before all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If possible, as much as depends on you, keeping peace with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but give place to wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,"says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore "If your enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for [by ]doing this you will heap burning coals upon his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul submit to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God, and the authorities that exist are instituted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Consequently the [one] resisting the authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and those opposing shall receive judgment to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a fear to good works, but to evil. And do you wish not to fear the authority?[ ]Do what is good, and you shall have praise from the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's servant, an avenger for wrath to the [one] practicing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For on account of this you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe nothing to no one, except to love one another, for he who loves one another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For, "You shall not commit adultery,""You shall not murder,""You shall not steal,""You shall not covet,"and [if ]there is any other commandment, in this word it is summed up, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And do this, knowing the time, that [it is] already[ the] hour for us to be roused out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we [first ]believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is advanced, the day is at hand. Therefore let us put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelries and drinking bouts, not in orgies and debaucheries, not in strife and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for [its] lusts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Receive one that is weak in the faith, not for disputes over opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One indeed believes that he may eat all things, but another,[ ]being weak, eats [only ]vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God [has] received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master he stands or he falls. And he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One indeed judges one day above another; but another judges every day [the same]. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he that does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. And he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he that does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and he gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ died and rose and lived [again], so that He might be Lord of both [the] dead and [the] living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written: "As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each of us shall give account concerning himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but judge this rather, not to put a stumbling block or an offense before our brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him considering anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if your brother is grieved on account of your food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food the one on behalf of whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Therefore do not let your good be slandered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that serves Christ in these things is well pleasing to God and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Therefore let us pursue the things [which make] for peace and the things by which one may edify another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but [are] evil for the man eating with offense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor [to do anything] by which your brother stumbles or is offended or becomes weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Do you have faith? By yourself, have it before God. Blessed is he that does not condemn himself in what he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he who doubts, if he eats, has been condemned, because [it is ]not of faith; and everything which [is] not of faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We then who are strong are obligated to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of those reproaching You fell on Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For as many things as were previously written, were written for our own instruction, that through the patience and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now may the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be like-minded among one another, according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>so that you may with one accord and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore receive one another, just as also Christ received you, to [the] glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Christ Jesus has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and that the Gentiles might glorify God on behalf of His mercy, as it is written: "For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he says: "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again: "Praise the LORD, all you Gentiles! Praise Him, all you peoples!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Isaiah says: "There shall be the root of Jesse; and He that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>And I write more boldly to you brothers, in part, as reminding you, because of the grace having been given to me by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>that I should be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God as a priest, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>Therefore I have something to boast of in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out through me, in word and deed, for the obedience of [the] Gentiles-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>And so eagerly striving to evangelize not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon the foundation of another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but as it is written: "To whom He was not announced, they shall see; and those who have not heard shall understand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For this reason I also have been hindered many times from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a longing to come to you for many years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I travel to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope [while] traveling through to see you, and to be sent forward there by you, if I may be filled in part [from] you first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am traveling to Jerusalem ministering to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For Macedonia and Achaia thought it good to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>For they thought it good, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles shared in spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Therefore, having finished and having sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>But I know that coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beg you, brothers, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>so that in joy I may come to you through the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
