        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave Himself for our sins, so that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that you are turning so quickly from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is not another; except there are certain people who trouble you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach a gospel to you other than what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, and I say again just now, if anyone preaches a gospel to you other than what you received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, brothers, the gospel preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former conduct at one time in Judaism, that beyond measure I used to persecute the church of God, and I was devastating it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I was advancing in Judaism above many my own age, being far more zealous for the traditions of my forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal His Son in me, so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But they heard only, "He who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which at one time he was devastating."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking Titus along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation, and I set before them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those with influence, lest somehow I might run, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and that was because of false brothers secretly brought in (who slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might reduce us to slavery),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those who seemed to be something-whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows partiality to no man-so to me, those with influence contributed nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted [with] the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter [was with the gospel ]for the circumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for He who worked with Peter in [the] apostleship to the circumcised, worked also with me in [that for] the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace which was given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we [should go] to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only they desired that we should remember the poor, which indeed I made every effort to do this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain [men] came from James, he would eat together with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and began to separate himself, fearing those of the circumcision party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they did not act rightly with respect to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live in Gentile fashion and not in Jewish fashion, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by [the ]faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by [the] faith of Christ, and not by [the] works of the law; because no flesh shall be justified by [the] works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if by seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, then is Christ a minister of sin? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again the[ ]things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not annul the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was portrayed publicly among you as crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only do I wish to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, will you now be made perfect in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things in vain-If indeed [they] really [were] in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Just as Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know therefore that those who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, [saying] that, "In you all the nations shall be blessed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no one is justified by the law before God is evident, for "The just shall live by faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the law is not of faith, but "the man who does them shall live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brothers, I speak in human fashion: A covenant is of a man, yet having been confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises spoken. He does not say, "And to seeds,"as of many, but as of one, "And to your Seed,"who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the covenant previously confirmed to Christ by God, so that it make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance [comes] by the law, it is no longer of promise; but God has given it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom it had been promised; and it was commanded through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now the mediator is not for one person, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Therefore, [is] the law against the promises of God? By no means! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, having been hemmed in for the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Therefore the law has become our custodian, [leading us] to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, for as much time as the heir is a minor, he does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were minors, were enslaved by the elements of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>so that He might redeem those under the law, so that we might receive the adoption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But at one time indeed, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature were not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, having known God, or rather, having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which once again you wish to be slaves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest somehow I have worked hard for you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brothers, I beseech you, become as I am, because I also [am] as you [are]. You have not wronged me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the gospel to you the former [time.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise nor disdain, but as an angel of God you received me, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What then was your blessing? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Have I therefore become your enemy by speaking the truth to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are zealous about you in the wrong way; but they wish to shut you out, so that you will be zealous about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>And I wanted to be present with you just now and to change my tone; because I am uncertain about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by the servant girl, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the servant girl was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>which things are symbolic. For these are two covenants: one in fact from Mount Sinai, bearing children into slavery, which is Hagar-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in slavery with her children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren, who does not give birth; break forth and shout, who does not have birth pangs; because the children of the desolate are many more than those of her who has a husband."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But just as then the [one] who was born according to the flesh persecuted the [one born] according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl shall by no means inherit with the son of the freewoman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brothers, we are not children of the servant girl, but of the free[woman].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the freedom in which Christ has made us free, and do not be loaded down again with a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a obligated to keep the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You have become estranged from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we by the Spirit eagerly await [for] the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will be intent on nothing else; but he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>Oh that those who disturb you would even castrate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you, brothers were called to freedom; only do not use freedom for an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, in [this]: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these things oppose each other, so that you do not do the things that you wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are: adultery, fornication, immorality, lewdness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envies, murders, drinking bouts, revelries, and the like; which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>gentleness, self-control-against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brothers, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness, looking out for yourself lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each [person] examine his own work, and then he will have boasting in himself alone, and not in the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each one shall bear his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for what a man sows, this also he will reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he who sows to his flesh, from his own flesh will reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And while we do good, let us not lose heart, for in due season we shall reap if we do not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have opportunity, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as wish to make a good showing in the flesh, these compel you to get circumcised, only so that they should not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, but they wish you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
