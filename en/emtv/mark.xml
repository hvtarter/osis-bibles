        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>. THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>"A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the Judean country and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John was clothed with camel's hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and was eating locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he was preaching, saying, "There comes One after me who is stronger than me, of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and to loose the strap of His[ ]sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you in water, but He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit coming down upon Him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>Then a voice came from the heavens, "You are My beloved Son, in whom I have found delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And He was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan, and was with the wild animals; and the angels were ministering to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, "The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Then Jesus said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you become fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately leaving their nets they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And having gone forth from there a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately He called them. And after they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, they went away after Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they were going into Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and began teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, "Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-the Holy One of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And when the unclean spirit threw him into a convulsion, and crying out with a loud voice, came out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>Then they were all amazed, so that they were disputing among themselves, saying, "What is this? What new doctrine is this, that He commands even the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately the report of Him went out into the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately when they went out from the synagogue, they came to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And the mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with a fever, and immediately they spoke to Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>So He came and He raised her up, grasping her hand; and immediately the fever left her. And she began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Now when evening came, when the sun set, they were bringing to Him all those who were ill, and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the very early morning before dawn, He arose and He went out, and went away to a deserted place; and there He was praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with Him sought Him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found Him, they said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>But He said to them, "Let us go to the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also, because for this reason I have come forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>Then a leper came to Him, beseeching Him, kneeling before Him and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You are able to cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, being moved with compassion, [and] reaching out His hand, touched him, and said to him, "I am willing, be cleansed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And when He said this, immediately the leprosy left from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And [after] sternly warning him, immediately He sent him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and bring as an offering concerning your cleansing those things which Moses prescribed, as a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread widely the report, so that He was no longer able to enter into a city, but was outside in deserted places; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And He entered again into Capernaum after [some] days, and it was heard that He was in a certain house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even near the door. And He was speaking the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic being carried by four [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to get near Him because of the crowd, they removed the tiles from the roof where He was, and having dug through they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And Jesus, seeing their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins have been forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately, when Jesus recognized in His spirit that they were reasoning thus among themselves, He said to them, "Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins have been forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-He said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I say to you, arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose, and taking his bed, he went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw [anything] like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Then He went out again alongside the sea; and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He was teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Now it came about, as He was dining in Levi's house, that many tax collectors and sinners were dining together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to His disciples, "Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill. I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else [it] takes away its completeness, the new [piece] from the old [garment], and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Now it came about as He was going through the grainfields on the Sabbath, that His disciples began to make [their] way picking the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>But He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need, and became hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he entered into the house of God at the time Abiathar [was] high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those who were with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And He said to them, "The Sabbath came into being for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So then the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And He entered again into the synagogue. And a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they were observing Him, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And He said to the [one] who had the withered hand, "Step forward."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?"But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>Then the Pharisees went out with the Herodians and immediately conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a large multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a large multitude, when they heard everything He was doing, came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should crush Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For He had healed many, so that all who had afflictions were crowding upon Him, so that they might touch Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and would cry out, saying, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And He would warn them very much that they should not make Him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And He went up on the mountain and summoned those whom He wanted, and they came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And He appointed twelve, so that they might be with Him, and so that He might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And He gave Simon the name Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, He gave them the names Boanerges, which is, "Sons of Thunder";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they came into a house. Then again a crowd assembled, so that they were not even able to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>But when His relatives heard, they came out to seize Him, for they were saying, "He has lost His mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who were from Jerusalem came down and were saying, "He has Beelzebul,"and, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having summoned them, he began to say to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a household is divided against itself, that household is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he is not able to stand, but is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his possessions, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he may plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>"Assuredly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, also blasphemies, as many as they may blaspheme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is under sentence of eternal condemnation"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then His brothers and His mother came, and as they stood outside they sent to Him, calling for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are seeking You outside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>But He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And when He had looked around in a circle at those sitting around Him, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again He began to teach beside the sea. And a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He got aboard into the boat, and sat on the sea; and all the crowd was upon the land by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And He was teaching them many [things] by parables, and said to them in His teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it happened, as he sowed, that some [seed] fell alongside the road; and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some [seed ]fell into the thorns; and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But other [seed ]fell on good ground, and it was yielding fruit coming up and growing, and it was producing-some thirty[fold], some sixty[,] and some a hundred."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And He said, "He that has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>But when He was by himself, those around Him together with the twelve asked Him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And He said to them, "Unto you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come to be [spoken] in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that 'Seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven them.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And He said to them, "Do you not know this parable? How then will you know all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the [seeds] beside the road where the word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are similarly the [seeds] being sown on stony ground which, whenever they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but are shortlived. Afterward, when trials or persecution arise because of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are the [seeds] being sown in the thorns; they are the [ones] who are hearing the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things coming in choke out the word, and it becomes fruitless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are the [seeds] sown on good ground, such as who hear the word and welcome it, and bear fruit: some thirty [fold], some sixty, and some a hundred."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And He said to them, "A lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a measuring basket or under a bed, [is it?] [Is it] not[ brought] so that it may be put on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest, nor was it hidden but that it might come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>Then He said to them, "Watch what you hear. By what measure you measure, it will be measured out to you; and [more] will be added to you who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, [more] will be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And He said, "Thus is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast the seed on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and should grow, he himself does not know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth produces fruit of itself: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full wheat in the head of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But whenever the fruit permits, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>Then He said, "To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what sort of parable shall we illustrate it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed, which whenever it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>but whenever it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the garden vegetables, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to nest under its shade."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And by many such parables He would speak the word to them, just as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And apart from a parable He did not speak to them, however, privately to His disciples, he would explain all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took Him along as He was in the boat. And other little boats were also with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there was a severe windstorm, and the waves dashed up into the boat, so that it was already filling up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But He was in the stern, sleeping upon the cushion. And they awakened Him and said to Him, "Teacher! Does it not matter to You that we are perishing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And having awakened He rebuked the wind, and He said to the sea, "Peace, be still."And the wind abated and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>But He said to them, "Why are you so fearful? How [is it that] you do not have faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly, and were saying to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when He got out of the boat, immediately there met Him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, not even with chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been broken, and no one was able to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and bruising himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying out with a great voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For He was saying to him, "Come out from the man, unclean spirit!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And He was asking him, "What is your name?"And he answered, saying, "My name is Legion; for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he was imploring Him many [times] that He would not send them out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there near the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So all the demons implored Him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And immediately Jesus gave them permission. And when the unclean spirits came out, they entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, (there were about two thousand) and drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>But those feeding the pigs fled, and they reported it in the city and in the country. And they came out to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>Then they came to Jesus, and observed him who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and having been clothed and being of sound mind, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who saw it related to them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began to implore Him to go away from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed implored Him that he might be with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, "Go home to your own family, and report to them all the things that the Lord has done for you, and how He had compassion on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all the things Jesus did for him; and all were marveling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Now when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd was gathered to Him; and He was beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus. And seeing Him, he fell at His feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and was imploring Him many [times], saying, "My little daughter is near death, please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And He went away with him. And a large crowd was following Him, and they were pressing against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>Now a certain woman, suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and who had suffered many things under many physicians, and who had spent everything at her disposal, and was no better, but rather having become worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>when she heard about Jesus, she came from behind Him in the crowd and touched His clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she was saying, "If only I may touch His clothes, I will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she had been healed from her affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, He turned in the crowd [and] said, "Who touched My clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>But His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing against You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And He was looking around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While He was still speaking, they came from the synagogue leader, saying, "Your daughter [has] died. Why do you still trouble the Teacher?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, immediately when He heard the word being spoken, said to the synagogue leader, "Do not be afraid; only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And He did not permit anyone to follow along with Him except for Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And He went to the house of the synagogue leader, and observed a commotion, and [people] weeping and wailing, very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when He went in, He said to them, "Why are you making such commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but she is asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they were ridiculing Him. But putting them all out, He took along the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and He went in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And having grasped the hand of the child, He said to her, "Talitha, koumi,"which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the little girl arose and was walking about, for she was twelve years old. And they were overcome with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>But He ordered them strictly that no one should know this, and said that something should be given her to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Then He went out from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many when they heard were astonished, saying, "Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, and such miracles are coming about by His hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?"And they were offended at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>and He could do no miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick [people] and healed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He commanded them that they should take nothing for the journey except a staff, only-no knapsack, no bread, nor a copper [coin] for their money belts-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but [to go] having put on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And He said to them, "Wherever you may enter into a house, stay there until you go out from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And as many as do not receive you nor hear you, as you leave from there, shake off the dust underneath your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom or for Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And when they went out, they were preaching that [people] should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they were casting out many demons, and they were anointing with oil many who were sick, and were healing [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard, for His name became well known. And he said, "John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and for this reason the miracles are at work in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, "He is Elijah."But others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when he heard, Herod said, "It is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John would say to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Therefore Herodias held a grudge against him and was desiring to kill him, but she was not able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he was protecting him. And when he heard him, he did many things, but he would hear him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And when an opportune day arrived, when Herod for his birthday festivities was putting on a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and when Herodias' daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and his dinner guests, the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you may want, and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He also swore to her, "Whatever you may ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And when she had gone out, she said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and she requested, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king became exceedingly sorry; yet, because of his oaths and of those who reclined with him, he did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king, having sent an executioner, commanded his head to be brought. And having departed, he beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard, they came and took away his body and placed it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and they reported to Him all things, both everything they had done and everything they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And He said to them, "Come, you yourselves privately, to a deserted place and rest a little."For there were many coming and going, and they were not even finding opportunity to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they went away to a deserted place in the boat privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But the multitudes saw them going, and many recognized Him, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and preceded them, and they came together to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And when He came out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when it grew late, His disciples came to Him and said, "The place is deserted, and already the hour is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Dismiss them, so that they may go into the surrounding farms and villages and may buy themselves food; for they have nothing to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But answering, He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat."And they said to Him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii [worth of] bread and give them [something ]to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>But He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see."And when they found out they said, "Five, and two fish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then He gave orders for them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they reclined in parties of hundreds and of fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set them before them; and the two fish He divided to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>So they all ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and from the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and to go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, until He could dismiss the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And having taken leave of them, He departed to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>Now when it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>And seeing Him walking on the sea, they supposed Him to be a spirit, and they cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He spoke with them, and said to them, "Have courage! [It is] I AM; do not be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then He went up with them into the boat and the wind ceased. And they were greatly astounded among themselves beyond measure, and were marveling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they had not understood concerning the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they came out of the boat, immediately having recognized Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>running about that whole surrounding region, they began to carry about on beds those who were ill to wherever they would hear that He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever He would enter into villages, or towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and they would beg Him at least that they might touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with ceremonially unclean, that is, with unwashed [hands], they found fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands with [their] fist, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And [coming] from the marketplace, unless they bathe, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they have received [by tradition], like the washing of cups and pitchers, copper vessels and couches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but they eat bread with unwashed hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>And answering He said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>"For having left the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men-the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And He said to them, "Well do you set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, 'If a man says to [his] father or to [his ]mother, "Whatever you might be profited by me is Corban"- (that is, a gift),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>[thus] nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. And many similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And having summoned all the crowd, He said to them, "Hear Me, all [of you] and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him, can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When He had entered a house [away] from the crowd, His disciples were asking Him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>So He said to them, "Are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything entering a man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and passes into the latrine, [thus] purifying all foods?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And He said, "That which comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within and defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>From there He arose and He went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, He wanted no one to know it, but He was not able to escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race, and she was asking Him to cast the demon out from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>And she answered and said to Him, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat from the crumbs of the children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then He said to her, "Because of this saying, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And going away to her house, she found the demon having gone out, and her daughter having been placed on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Again, coming out from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He went to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the region of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>Then they brought to Him a deaf man impeded in speech, and they begged Him that He would lay His hand upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And when he had taken him aside from the crowd privately, He put His fingers in his ears, and having spit, He touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Then looking up into heaven, He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha,"that is, "Be opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking correctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And He ordered them that they should tell no one; but the more He ordered them, the more exceedingly they would proclaim it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when a great crowd had gathered, and not having anything to eat, Jesus, having summoned His disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been remaining with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I dismiss them hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from a [great ]distance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>Then His disciples answered Him, "From where will anyone be able to satisfy these [people] with bread here in this deserted place?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"And they said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, He broke [them ]and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set [them] before [the people]; and they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fish; and having blessed [them], He said to set them before [the people].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So they ate and were filled, and they took up an abundance of fragments, seven hampers [full].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now those having eaten were about four thousand. And He dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately stepping into the boat with His disciples, He came to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>Then the Pharisees came out and began to question Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And having dismissed them, and stepping into the boat again, He went away to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they forgot to take bread, and except [for] one loaf, they did not have [any] with themselves in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Then He charged them, saying, "Look out, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "because we have no bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>But Jesus, knowing about it, said to them, "Why are you reasoning because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?"They said to Him, "Twelve."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>"And when [I broke] the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you take up?"And they said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>So He said to them, "How [is it] you do not understand?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and implored Him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And having taken the hand of the blind [man], He led him outside the village, and having spit on his eyes, and having laid His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And when he looked up he said, "I see men like trees, walking."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him to look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, "Neither go into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He was questioning His disciples, saying to them, "Who do men pronounce Me to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>So they answered, "John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Then He warned them that they should tell no one about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And He began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>He was speaking this word with boldness. And Peter, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But when He had turned and saw His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>And having summoned the crowd together with His disciples, He said to them, "Whoever is willing to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's, will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a man give [as] an equivalent for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whosoever is ashamed of Me and My words among this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him, whenever He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>And He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will by no means taste death till they see the kingdom of God actually come in power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up into a high mountain alone by themselves. And He was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth is able to whiten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>for he did not know what he should say, for they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud appeared overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, [saying], "This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone, but only Jesus with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should relate to no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man should rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And this word they kept to themselves, questioning what it meant to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked Him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And answering He said to them, "Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I say to you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written concerning him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>And when He came to the disciples, He saw a large crowd around them, and scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to Him, they greeted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And He asked the scribes, "What are you disputing about with them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>Then one of the crowd answered and said, "Teacher, I brought my son to You, because he has a mute spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and gnashes his teeth, and he becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they might cast it out, but they were not able."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>He answered him and said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>Then they brought the boy to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and having fallen on the ground he was rolling about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>So He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?"And he said, "From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And often it threw him both into the fire and into the waters so that it may destroy him. But if You are able [to do] anything, help us and have compassion on us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him, "If you are able to believe: all things are possible to him that believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>And immediately crying out, the father of the child said with tears, "I believe, Lord; help my unbelief!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>Then having cried out and having convulsed him greatly, it came out. And he became as one dead, so that many were saying, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus, having grasped him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And after He entered into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>So He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And having gone out from there they were passing through Galilee, and He did not wish that anyone should know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For He was teaching His disciples and said to them, "The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>Then He came to Capernaum. And being in the house He asked them, "What were you disputing about with one another on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent, for on the road they had discussed with one another who [was] greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And having sat down He called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And taking a child, He stood him in their midst. And taking him in His arms, He said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me, but Him who sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>Now John answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow with us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name that will be able to soon speak evil of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For he who is not against you is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you are Christ's, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were around his neck, and he be cast into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter into life maimed, than to enter having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>"And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>"And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It would be better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into the fiery hell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where 'Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Then He arose from there and came to the region of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds came together to Him, and as He was accustomed, He was teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>And some Pharisees approached and asked Him, "Is it lawful for a husband to put away his wife?"testing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>But answering He said to them, "What did Moses command you?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>In the house His disciples also asked Him again concerning the same [matter].</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>Now as He was going out into the road, one came running up, and having knelt before Him, he asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not commit murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not bear false witness,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and your mother.' "</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>And the scribes and chief priests heard it and they sought how they might destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.19'>And when it became evening, He was going forth outside of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>Now in the morning while passing by, they saw the fig tree dried up from [its] roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>And Peter, remembering, said to Him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has dried up!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>So Jesus answered and said to them, "Have faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.23'>For assuredly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that the things which he says are coming to pass, whatever he says shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.24'>For this reason I say to you, all things whatsoever you ask for in prayer, believe that you [will] receive [them], and they will be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.25'>"And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive [them], that your Father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.27'>Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking about in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.28'>And they said to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>And they were debating among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Then He began to speak to them with parables: "A man planted a vineyard and set a fence around it, dug a wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at [harvest] time he sent a servant to the farmers, in order that he might receive [his part] from the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And they took him and beat [him] and sent [him] away empty-[handed].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Again he sent them another servant, and that one they wounded in the head with stones, and they sent him away shamefully treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And again he sent another, and that one they killed, and [so with ]many others, beating some and killing others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he even sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>"And taking him they killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the farmers, and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This was the LORD's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to lay hold of Him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that He had spoken the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, in order that they might catch Him in [His ]discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And they came and said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and it does not make a difference to you about anyone; for You do not look on the face of men, but you teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we give, or should we not give?"But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius, that I may see it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>So they brought [one]. And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"And they said to Him, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And Jesus answered and said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."And they marveled at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then some Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked Him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies and leaves behind a wife and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>[Now] there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and he died, and left no offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>[Therefore], in the resurrection, when they shall arise, whose wife of them will she be? For all seven had her [as] wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus answered and said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For whenever they rise from among the dead, neither do they marry nor are they given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in connection with [the burning] bush [passage], how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of [the ]dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you are greatly mistaken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Then one of the scribes came, after he heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the first commandment of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>' And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>So the scribe said to Him, "Well [said], Teacher, in truth You said that He is one, and there is no other besides Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love Him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Now when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."And no one dared any longer to question Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Then Jesus answered and said, as [He was] teaching in the temple, "How say the scribes that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>"Therefore David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how then is He his Son?"And the large crowd was hearing Him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>Then He said to them in His teaching, "Take heed of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and [like] greetings in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense pray at length. These will receive more abundant judgment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and was observing how the crowd was putting money into the treasury. And many rich [people] were putting in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>Then one poor widow came and put in two lepta, which equals a quadrans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And having summoned His disciples, He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all put in out of their excess, but this woman, out of her destitution, put in everything she had, her whole livelihood."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as He was going out from the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, "Teacher, see what sort of stones and what sort of buildings!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>And Jesus answered and said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? By no means shall one stone be left upon another, which shall in any way escape destruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>And He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And Jesus, answering them, began to say: "Take heed lest anyone deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and they will deceive many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>But whenever you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed; for these things must occur, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>For nation will be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and disturbances. These [are] the beginnings of birth pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But take heed to yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>But whenever they lead you forth to deliver you over, do not worry beforehand [as to ]what you will say, nor rack your brains. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak this; for it is not you who is speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and will cause them to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>And you will be hated by all on account of My name. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>"So whenever you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where he must not"-he who reads, let him understand-"then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He was reclining for a meal, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly pure nard. And having broken the flask, she began to pour it out over His head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For it was possible [for] this to be sold for more than three hundred denarii, and to be given to the poor."And they were scolding her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>But Peter followed Him from a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest, and he was sitting together with the attendants and warming himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus, in order to put Him to death, but found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>For many were testifying falsely against Him, but their testimonies were not the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Then some stood up and were testifying falsely against Him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>"We heard Him saying, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and after three days I will build another [one ]not made with hands.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But not even in this way was their testimony the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You answer nothing? What are these men testifying against You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest was questioning Him, saying to Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard the blasphemy! How does it appear to you?"And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with [their] fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!"And the attendants were striking Him with slaps [to the face.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are saying."And he went outside into the forecourt, and a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the servant girl seeing him again, began to say to those standing by, "This [man] is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again he was denying [it]. And a little later those who were standing by said to Peter again, "Truly you are one of them; for you are also a Galilean, and your accent is like [theirs]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then he began to curse and to swear, "I do not know this Man whom you are speaking of"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And for the second [time] a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times."And when he thought about it, he began to weep.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation, along with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin; and having bound Jesus, they led [Him] away, and delivered [Him] to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"And He answered and said to him, "You are saying [what is so]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests were accusing Him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the feast he would release one prisoner to them, whomever they would request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>Then the crowd cried out and began to request [that] just as always he would do [this] for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered Him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>But Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you desire [that] I should do [with Him ]whom you call King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And again they cried, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered up Jesus, after he had Him flogged, so that He might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>Then the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and assembled the whole garrison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, and they put it around His head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and they began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they were striking His head with a reed and were spitting on Him; and bowing the knee, they [mockingly ]worshipped Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple, and dressed Him in His own clothing. And led Him out so that they might crucify Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they pressed into service a certain [man] [that was] passing by [named] Simon, a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming from the country, that he might carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought Him to the place [called ]Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes by casting lots over them,[ to determine] who would take what.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And there was the inscription of His charge having been inscribed: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And together with Him they crucified two bandits, one on His right side and the one on His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him] to each other with the scribes said, "He saved others; Himself He is not able to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe Him."Even those who were crucified with Him were reviling Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>Now when the sixth hour had come, darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lima sabachthani?"which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some of those standing by when they heard, said, "Look, He is calling Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one, running and having filled a sponge [with] vinegar, and having put it around a reed, was giving a drink to Him, saying, "Leave Him alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus, uttering a loud cry, expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>Now when the centurion who stood across from Him saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who also would follow Him and would minister to Him when He was in Galilee; and many other women who had come up together with Him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now evening having come, since it was Preparation Day, which is the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, he went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if He was already dead; and having summoned the centurion, he questioned him if He had been dead long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And having bought linen cloth, and having taken Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen cloth and set Him down in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone upon the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were observing where He was placed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary[ the mother] of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And having looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away-for it was exceedingly large.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right clothed with a white robe, and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has arisen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, say to His disciples, and Peter, that He is going before you into Galilee; there you shall see Him, just as He said to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And going out, they fled from the tomb, but trembling and amazement held them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now having arisen early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and reported to those who had been with Him, as they were grieving and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those, when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, [they ]disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were going into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And those returned and reported it to the rest; but neither did they believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterwards He appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw Him after He had been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that does not believe shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall accompany those who have believed: In My name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall lay hands on [the] sick, and they shall be well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen.</verse>
