        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all those who in every place are calling on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you were enriched by Him in all speech and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not lacking in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you until the end, [that you may be] unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there is quarreling among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now I say this, that each of you says, "I am of Paul,"and "I[ ]of Apollos,"and "I[ ]of Cephas,"and "I of Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I will annul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, God was well pleased, through the foolishness of our preaching, to save those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not many noble, [are called].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose the foolish things of the world in order that He might humiliate the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world in order that He might humiliate the mighty[.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And the lowly things of the world, and the despised things God has chosen, and the things which are not, in order that He might nullify the things which are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no man may boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But from Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, as it is written, "He that boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my message and my preaching [were] not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>in order that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, we speak wisdom among those that are mature, but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are being destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the [wisdom] having been hidden, which God foreordained before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age understood (for had they understood, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed [them] to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, in order that we might know the things freely given to us by God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught by the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For "Who has known the mind of the LORD, that he may instruct Him?"But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, and not solid food; for you were not yet able [to receive it]. Indeed, neither are you now yet able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal, and walking according to human principles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, "I am of Paul,"and another, "I [am] of Apollos,"are you not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord has given to each one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are coworkers with God; you are God's field, you are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, but another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no other foundation can anyone lay, other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds on this foundation [with] gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each one's work shall be made manifest; for the Day shall reveal it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test each one's work, as to what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone's work which he has built remains, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone's work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which [temple] you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, "The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are useless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come-all things[ ]are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so consider us, as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now furthermore what is required among the stewards, is that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a human court. Indeed, I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious of nothing, but I have not been justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So then judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who also will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make clear the purposes of the hearts. Then each one's praise shall come from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brothers, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, in order that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did indeed receive [what you have], why do you boast as though you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already full! You are already rich! You have reigned [as kings] without us; and I wish [that] indeed you did reign, in order that we also might reign with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men appointed to death; for we became a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are despised!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are naked, and beaten, and homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we encourage; we have become as the sweepings of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you might have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you do] not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Because of this I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are arrogant, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually heard that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the Gentiles-that a man has his father's wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you have become arrogant, and have not rather grieved, so that he who did this deed would be removed from your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I indeed, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has done this deed in this way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, in order that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So then let us observe the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my epistle not to associate with fornicators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Yet I certainly did not mean with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to leave this world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone named a brother, who is a fornicator, or covetous person, or an idolater, or abusive person, or a drunkard, or a swindler-not even to eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those who are outside God will judge. Therefore "put away the evil person from yourselves."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Does any of you, having a matter against another, dare go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels? Let alone ordinary [matters]!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint those who are disdained within the church [to judge?]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say [this] to your shame. So is there not among you a wise [man], not even one, who will be able to judge between his brother [and another]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Actually then, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather accept wrong? Why not rather accept being defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you wrong and defraud, and these things [to your] [own ]brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor covetous, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor abusive people, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you! But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both this [stomach] and these [foods]. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>Now God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up through His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] members of a harlot? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body [with her]? For "the two,"He says, "shall become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that is joined with the Lord is one spirit [with Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the[ ]things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let each [man] have his own wife, and let each [woman] have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband [does]. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife [does].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another, except by mutual agreement, [and that] for a season, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I wish that all men would be as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they should remain as I also [remain];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>but if they are not exercising self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn [with passion].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>Now to those who have married I command, yet not I, but the Lord: A wife is not to be separated from her husband-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>and even if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband-and a husband is not to divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, let him not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, if he consents to live with her, let her not divorce him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving [spouse] separates, let [him or her ]separate; the brother or the sister has not been bound in such cases; but God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Otherwise as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called as a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather make use of [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's free [man]. Likewise he who is called as a free [man] is Christ's slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Brothers, let each one remain with God in [the state] in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord; but I give judgment, as having received mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>Therefore I consider this to be good because of the present distress, that [it is] good for a man to be as he is:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But even if you should marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>But this I say, brothers, the time has been shortened; so that from now on even those having wives should be as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those weeping as though not weeping, and those rejoicing as though not rejoicing, and those buying as though not possessing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those using this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man cares about the things of the Lord-[about ]how he may please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the [man] having married cares about the things of the world-[about ]how he may please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>And the wife and the virgin are different. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the woman having married cares about the things of the world-about how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a snare upon you, but for that which is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he desires. He does not sin; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But [he] who stands in his heart, not having necessity, but has power over his own desire, and has decided this in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife has been bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband also dies, she is free to be married to whom she desires, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is more blessed if she remains as she is, in my opinion-and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body-whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free-and we were all given to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For in fact the body is not one part but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,"is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,"is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body [were] an eye, where [would be] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [would be] the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has set the parts, each one of them, in the body just as He desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if all [parts ]were one part, where [would be] the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now indeed there[ are] many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But to a greater degree the parts of the body which seem weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And [the parts] of the body which we consider to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater propriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>But our presentable [parts] have no need. But God united the body, giving greater honor to the [part] being inferior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>lest there be divisions in the body, but the parts care the same for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one part suffers, all the parts suffer together; or if one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And [those] whom God has appointed in the church [are]: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>All [are] not apostles, [are they]? All [are] not prophets, [are they]? Are all teachers? [Are] all [workers of] miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But strive for the better gifts. And yet I make known a more excellent way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become [as] sounding brass or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I give away all my possessions to feed [the poor], and though I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient, love is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast, is not arrogant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>does not behave disgracefully, does not seek its own, is not provoked to anger, thinks no evil;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>Now we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is partial shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away the things of the child.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and desire the spiritual [gifts], but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men, but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in an [unknown] tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you should prophesy; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in a prophesy, or in doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Likewise the lifeless things, when they make a sound, whether flute or harp, unless they make a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is being played on the flute, or what is being played on the harp?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet gives an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also you, [if you] do not give a clear word by the tongue, how will it be known what is being spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, perhaps, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the sound, I shall be as a foreigner to the [one ]speaking, and the [one] speaking [shall be] as a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that you may abound to the edification of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let he that speaks in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say "Amen"when you give thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order that I may instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not be children in your understanding; rather, in malice be children, but in understanding be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written: "With men of other tongues and by strange lips I will speak to this people; and yet not even in this way will they hear Me,"says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If then the whole church comes together at the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is reproved by all, he is discerned by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And so the secrets of his heart become clear; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is truly among you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a song, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be ]by two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and let others discriminate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if [something] is revealed to another who sits by, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy [one] by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not [the author] of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>let your women be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be in subjection, just as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or did the word of God go forth from you? Or did it come to you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or [is] spiritual[,] let him recognize that the things which I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done properly and according to order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I made known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>through which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Thereafter He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Thereafter He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all, as of [one] born out of due time, He appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than them all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith also is vain!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And we are found [to be ]false witnesses of God, because we bore witness concerning God, that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise-if in fact the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, [then] neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are to be pitied above all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, [and] has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by a man [came] death, also by a Man came the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then [will be] the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He abolishes every ruler and every authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For "He has subjected all things under His feet."But when He says that "all things have been subjected,"it is evident that [this is] except for Him who subjected all things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then also the Son Himself will be subjected to Him who subjected all things to Him, in order that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? Why are they also baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I [affirm], by my boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If, in the manner of men, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what is the benefit to me? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived: "Evil associations corrupt good habits."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin! For some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Fool, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that will be, but a bare grain-perhaps wheat or some other [grains].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives to it a body just as He desired, and to each of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is a different [kind] [of flesh] for men, and another flesh for beasts, another for fish, and another for birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>And there[ are ]heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from [another] star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus also it is written, "The first man Adam [became] a living being;"the last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However, that which is spiritual is not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man [was ]from earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Like the [man] made of dust, so also [are] those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly [Man], so also [are ]those [who are ]heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And just as we have borne the image of the [man] made of dust, let us also bear the image of the heavenly [Man].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible should put on incorruption, and this mortal should put on immortality, then will come to pass the word which was written: "Death was swallowed up in victory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>"O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So then, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection which is for the saints, as I directed to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also:</verse>
