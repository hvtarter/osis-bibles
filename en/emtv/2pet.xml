        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='2Pet'>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us by [the] righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>[May ]grace and peace be multiplied [to you] in [your] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>As His divine power has granted to us all things [pertaining] to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>through which have been given to us precious and exceedingly great promises, so that through these we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>But also [for] this very reason, making every effort, provide with your faith virtue, and with virtue knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and with knowledge self-control, and with self-control perseverance, and with perseverance godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and with godliness brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things belong to you and are increasing, it makes you neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For [he] who lacks these things is blind, being shortsighted, having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, be even more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for by doing these things you shall by no means stumble at any time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For in this way the entrance will be supplied to you richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I shall not neglect to constantly remind you concerning these things, although you know and have been established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing that the putting off of my tent is soon, just as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And I will make an effort also, whenever necessary, to cause you to have a reminder of these things after my departure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we did not follow craftily devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather became eyewitnesses of His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For He received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice was brought to Him such as this by the Magnificent Glory: "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And we heard this voice being uttered from heaven, when we were with Him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And we have the prophetic word made more sure, which you do well to heed, as a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes about [from] one's own interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being brought along by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master, the [One] having bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow after their debaucheries, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And by covetousness they will exploit you with fabricated words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction will not sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but rather confined [them] to Tartarus, and delivered [them ]into chains of darkness, reserved for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, [the] eighth, a preacher of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon the ungodly world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, He condemned [them] to destruction, having made [them] an example who were to be ungodly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and He rescued righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the indecent conduct of lawless [men]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, tormented his righteous soul by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>[then] the Lord knows [how] to deliver the godly out of temptation and [how] to keep the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. [They are ]bold, self-willed, illustrious persons, they do not tremble at blaspheming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, being greater in might and in power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as unreasoning natural animals, having been born for capture and destruction, blaspheme at things which they are ignorant of, and shall be destroyed in their destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>receiving the wages of unrighteousness, counting as a pleasure to revel in the daytime, [they are] spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart having been trained in greediness, they are accursed children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>They have left behind the straight way and have gone astray, having followed after the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but he was rebuked for his own lawlessness: a dumb donkey speaking with the voice of a man restrained the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are waterless wells, clouds being driven by a storm, for whom the darkness of the netherworld has been reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For when they speak haughty [words] of emptiness, they entice through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, those who are escaping from those who are living in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising to them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, by this [one] also he has been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if having escaped from the corruptions of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, yet by these, having become entangled they are defeated, the latter end has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it was better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than knowing it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But it has happened to them [according to] the [saying] of the true proverb: "A dog returns to his own vomit,"and, "A sow, having washed, [returns ] to her wallowing in the mire."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This already, beloved, [is] the second letter I write to you, in [both of] which I stir up your pure mind by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the words having been previously spoken by the holy prophets, and the commandment of your apostles of the Lord and Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>knowing this first: that mockers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers died, all things continue as from the beginning of creation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this they willingly forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and [the] earth, consisting out of water and through water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which the world at that time perished, being flooded by water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>but the present heavens and earth, having been stored up by His word, are being reserved for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But in this let it not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord does not delay concerning His promise, as some reckon slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, both the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Therefore, [seeing that] all these things shall be dissolved, what sort of [people] ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens, being set of fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements, burning with heat, shall melt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot or blemish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation-just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on guard, lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being carried away by the error of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory both now and forever. Amen.</verse>
