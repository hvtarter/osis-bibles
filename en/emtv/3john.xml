        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>THE ELDER, To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, concerning all things I pray you to prosper and to be healthy, just as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when [the ]brothers came and witnessed to the truth which is in you, just as you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear [that] my children are walking in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who gave testimony concerning your love before the church, [with reference] to whom you will do well if you send them forth in a manner worthy of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>for on behalf of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the pagans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, in order that we may become fellow workers with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves the preeminence over them, does not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>On account of this, if I come, I will call to mind his works which he does, slandering us with evil words. And not being content with that, he does not receive the brothers, and hinders those who desire to, casting them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. He that does good is of God; he that does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has a good testimony with everyone, and of the truth itself. And we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I wish to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
