        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always concerning you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>constantly remembering your work of faith, labor of love, and perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, beloved brothers, your election by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, just as you know what kind [of men ]we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, in that you received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became patterns to all those who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves report about us what kind of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, [regarding] our coming to you, that it was not in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But suffering before and being spitefully treated at Philippi, just as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation [was ]not from error nor from uncleanness, nor in trickery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who is testing our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither were we using flattering speech, as you know, nor covering up greed, God is [our ]witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others, even though we were able to carry weight as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we proved to be gentle in your midst, as a nursing [mother] cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>In this way longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and [so is ]God, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we were among you that believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>as indeed you know how each one of you, as a father [to] his own children, we exhorted, and comforted [you], and imploring you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>Because of this we also give thanks to God unceasingly, so that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you received not the word of men, but just as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen, just as also they [did] by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and [are] against all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved, so as always to fill up [the measure of] their sins; but the wrath [of God ]has come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, being unwillingly separated from you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, were all the more eager to see your face with much desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we desired to come to you-I, Paul, time and again, but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? [Is] it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we were well pleased to be left behind in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, in order to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one should be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed unto this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For even when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we were going to be afflicted, just as it also happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Because of this, when I could no longer endure [it], I sent to learn about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timothy came to us from you, and brought good news to us of your faith and your love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, as we also [long to see] you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this we were encouraged, brothers, in regard to you in all our affliction and distress by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>Because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For whatever thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we are rejoicing because of you in the presence of our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and to perfect what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, lead us directly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all [men], as indeed we also do toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brothers, we request of you and exhort [you] in the Lord Jesus, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you should abound more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is [the] will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one should transgress against and to defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger concerning all, just as we told you before and solemnly testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who rejects [this] does not reject man, but God, who has given His Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>Now concerning brotherly love you have no need [for me] to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>For indeed you do so toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you increase more and more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that you aspire to be quiet, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>in order that you may walk decently toward those that are outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you be sorrowful as those who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose [again], thus also God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall by no means precede those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Because the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a word of command, with [the] voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>So then comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I should write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they say, "Peace and safety!"then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as labor pains upon the woman that is pregnant, and they shall by no means escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those[ ]getting drunk, are drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But we, since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to [the] obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, in order that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we request of you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and instruct you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to regard them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the discouraged, be supportive of the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue that which is good, both for one another and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>But test all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>Now [may] the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>He who calls you is faithful, who also will do [this].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord [for] this letter to be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
