        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church at your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the sharing of your faith may become effective in full knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have much thanksgiving and encouragement over your love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>rather on account of love I appeal to you-being such a one as Paul, the elder, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who formerly was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I am sending back. You therefore receive him, that is, my very heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I wished to keep with myself, in order that on your behalf he might serve me in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I wished to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good might not be by necessity, but by [being] voluntary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he was taken away for a time on account of this, in order that you might keep him eternally,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave but more than a slave-a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you count me as a partner, receive him as [you would ]me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he has wronged you or owes [anything], charge this to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay-lest I say to you that even yourself you owe to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, may I have profit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having been persuaded of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But meanwhile, also prepare for me a guestroom, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow captive in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>[ as do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
