        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='1Pet'>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect sojourners of the Dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>into an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who by the power of God [are] being guarded through faith for the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In which you greatly rejoice, [though for] a little while now, if need be, you have been distressed by various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, though being tested with fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>Whom not having seen, you love, in whom now not seeing, but believing, you rejoice with inexpressible joy and glorified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>obtaining for yourselves the outcome your faith-the salvation [of your] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning this salvation the prophets have sought out and inquired carefully, having prophesied of the grace [that would come] to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was revealing when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories which were to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to you they were ministering these things, which things were now announced to you by those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven-things which angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, stay sober, put your hope fully in the grace brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves [after] the former lusts, [as you did in ]your ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as He[ ]who called you is holy, you also be holy in all manner of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one's work, pass the time of your sojourning [here] in fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your futile way of life handed down from your forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb blameless and spotless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>having been foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, He was made manifest in these last times for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere love for the brothers, love one another fervently from a pure heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For "All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man is as the flower of [the] grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of the LORD endures forever."Now this is the word which was proclaimed to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore having put away all malice, all guile, hypocrisy, envy, and all slanders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babes, desire the genuine milk of the word, that by it you may grow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if indeed you tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>Coming to Him as to a living stone, having been rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also, as living stones, are being built [into] a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>For it is also contained in the Scripture, "Behold, I place in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, precious, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>Therefore, to you who believe, [He] is precious; but to those who are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense."They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's [own] possession, that you may proclaim the excellent virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who formerly [were] not a people but now [are the] people of God, who had not received mercy, but now have received mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I implore you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your manner of life noble among the Gentiles, so that, whenever they speak against you as evildoers, when they observe the good works, they may glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Therefore subject yourselves to every human institution on account of the Lord: whether to the king as [to one] having authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as to those being sent for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise [of those] doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may silence the ignorance of foolish men-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, yet not using freedom as a cover for wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all [people]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, subject yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is admirable, if because of conscience toward God someone endures pain, suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory [is it,] if when you sin and are beaten, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer [for it,] you endure, this is admirable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving behind an example for you, that you should follow in His footsteps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>"Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, being verbally abused, did not return verbal insults, when [He] suffered, [He] did not threaten, but committed [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, in order that having died to sins, we might live unto righteousness-by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were like sheep going astray, but you have turned back now to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Wives, likewise, subject yourselves to your own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, [that] by the conduct of their wives, without a word, they shall be gained [for Christ],</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>when they observe your chaste conduct with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Of whom let it not be the outward adorning of braiding of hair, and wearing of gold, or of putting on of [fine] clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>rather [let it be] the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible [attitude] of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For thus formerly, the holy women who hoped on God also adorned themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom you became children, when you do good and are not afraid of any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Husbands, likewise, live together according to knowledge as with a weaker vessel, with the wife, showing her honor as also a fellow heir of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all [of you] be like-minded, sympathetic, loving the brothers, compassionate, friendly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called for this purpose, that you may inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For "He that desires to love life and see good days, let him stop his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and His ears [open] to their prayer; but the face of the LORD is against those doing evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he that shall injure you if you become imitators of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you should suffer on account of righteousness, [you are] blessed. "But do not fear their threats, nor be troubled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be prepared with a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, so that in what they speak against you as evildoers, those reviling your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is the will of God, than [for] doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also suffered once to atone for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that He might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who formerly disobeyed, when the longsuffering of God was waiting in the days of Noah, when the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>which [as] an antitype, baptism now also saves us-(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but an appeal to God [for] a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who having gone into heaven, is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, you also arm yourselves [with] the same mind, because he who suffered in [the] flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>that he no longer should live the remaining time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For we have spent enough of our past lifetime to accomplish the will of the Gentiles-having walked in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In regard to these, they are surprised that you do not run with them in the same flood of debauchery, reviling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>Unto this [end] was the gospel proclaimed also to those who are dead, in order that they might be judged according to men in [the] flesh, but [that] they might live according to God in [the] spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>Now the end of all things is at hand; therefore be of sound mind and self-controlled in your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent love for one another, because "love will cover a multitude of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as the utterances of God. If anyone serves, [let him serve] as from strength, as God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be surprised by the fiery trial among you, taking place to test you, as though some strange thing [was] happening to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but inasmuch as you partake in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, in order that also at the unveiling of His glory, you may rejoice with great happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reviled in the name of Christ, blessed are you, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On the one hand He is blasphemed, but on the other He is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>For let not anyone of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's affairs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>but if anyone [suffers] as a Christian, let him not be put to shame, but let him glorify God in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if [it begins] with us first, what will be the end of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And "If the righteous [one] is scarcely saved, where will the godless and the sinner appear?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders who are among you I exhort, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by compulsion, but rather willingly, not in fondness for dishonest gain, but rather eagerly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>nor as being masters over the flock [under you,] but rather being examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, younger [people], subject yourselves to [the] elders. And all of you be subject to one another, and be clothed with humility, because "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be watchful; your adversary the devil walks about as a roaring lion, seeking someone he may devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Resist him, being steadfast in [your] faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But may the God of all grace, the [One ]having called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little [while], may He Himself make you complete-He will establish, strengthen, [and] firmly ground [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To Him be the glory and the power, forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus the faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying this to be [the] true grace of God in which you stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
