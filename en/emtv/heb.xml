        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last days spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir [of] all things, through whom also He made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the radiance of His glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did He ever say: "You are My Son, today I have begotten You"? And again: "I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: "Let all the angels of God worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels He says, "He who makes His angels spirits and His ministers flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But of the Son [He says]: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: "You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but You continue; and they all shall grow old like a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like a cloak You will roll them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels has He ever said: "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits being sent out to minister for the sake of those who shall be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>On account of this we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word which was spoken through angels was confirmed, and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which in the beginning was spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For He did not subject the world which is to come, concerning which we speak, to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But someone somewhere testified, saying: "What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him a little lower than the angels, You crowned him with glory and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You have subjected all things under his feet."For in subjecting to him all things[, ]He left nothing not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see all things having been subjected to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, through the suffering of death, having been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God, He might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting for Him, on account of whom [are] all things and through whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the Author of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying: "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: "I will put My trust in Him."And again: "Behold I and the children to whom God has given Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore since the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same things, in order that through death He might destroy the [one] having the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and that He might set free these, as many as by fear of death through all of their lives, were subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For indeed He does not take hold of angels, but He does take hold of the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore He was obligated to become like His brothers in all [respects], in order that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things [pertaining] to God, in order that He might make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that which He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who is faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For He has been counted worthy of more honor than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but He[ ]who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which would be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ [was faithful ]as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the boast of hope firm until [the] end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you will hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your fathers tested Me, they tried Me, and saw My works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was indignant with that generation, and said, 'They go astray in their heart; and they did not know My ways.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but encourage yourselves every day, while it is called "Today,"lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become partakers of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said: "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some, having heard, did provoke: but not all who came out of Egypt through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was He indignant forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did He swear that they would not enter into His rest, except to those who disobeyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see that they were not able to enter on account of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore let us fear, lest while the promise remains to enter into His rest, any one of you seems to have fallen short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For indeed we have had the gospel preached [to us] just as those also; but the word which they heard did not profit those, not having been mixed with faith in those having heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed enter that rest, as He has said: "So I swore in My wrath, they shall not enter My rest,"although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and again in this place: "They shall not enter My rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Therefore since it remains [for] some to enter into it, and those formerly having the gospel preached [to them] did not enter on account of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again He appoints a certain day, saying in David, "Today,"after such a time, just as it has been said: "Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not have spoken afterward of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into His rest also rested himself from his works, as God [did] from His own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Therefore let us be diligent to enter into that rest, lest anyone falls in the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is no creature hidden before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes, to whom we must give an account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore having a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but having been tempted in all [respects] in quite the same way as [we are], yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in the things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to deal gently with those who sin in ignorance and go astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>On account of this he is obligated to offer [sacrifices ]for sins, just as concerning the people, so also concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no man takes this honor for himself, but he that is called by God, just as Aaron also [was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>Just as He also says in another place: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up both prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears to the [One] who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though He was a Son, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been designated by God a High Priest "according to the order of Melchizedek,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>concerning whom we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For indeed, although you ought to be teachers by this time, again you have need [for someone ]to teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who partakes [only ]of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for the mature, for those because of their practice have their senses trained for the distinguishing of both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving the subject of the beginning of Christ, let us be moved to perfection, not again laying down a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And let us do this if indeed God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and became partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God and [the] powerful deeds of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, to renew [them] again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and hold Him up to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinks the rain often coming upon it, and bears suitable vegetation for those on account of whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, of which the end [is] for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, of better things and those pertaining to salvation, even though we speak in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until [the] end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>lest you become dull, but [become] imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had been patient, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men indeed swear by the greater, and the oath for confirmation [is] an end of every dispute to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Thus God, wanting to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, guaranteed it by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement, who have fled to take hold of the hope being set before [us];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and secure, and which enters into the inner [side] of the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where the Forerunner has entered on our behalf, [even] Jesus, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all, first being interpreted "king of righteousness,"and then also king of Salem, which is "king of peace,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But observe how great this [man was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but the [one] not tracing his descent from them has received tithes from Abraham, and he has blessed the [one] having the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now without any contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here on the one hand mortal men receive tithes, but there on the other he[ receives them], of whom[ ]it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>Even Levi, the [one] receiving tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Therefore, if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), why is there yet a need [for] another priest to rise, according to the order of Melchizedek, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there occurs a change of law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For He concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, regarding which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet even more clearer, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For He testifies: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For on the one hand an annulment comes about of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and uselessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the law made nothing perfect; but there[ is] the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as [it was] not without an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him that said to Him: "The LORD has sworn and will not relent, 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek' ",</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much more Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But He, because He remains forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those coming to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, innocent, undefiled, having been separated from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices beforehand, on behalf of His own sins and then for the people's, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, [appoints] a Son who has been perfected forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now this is the main point of the things being said: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses had been warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for He says, "See, you shall make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault [with] them, He says: "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not persevere in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind, and I will inscribe them upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And by no means will they teach each [one ]his fellow citizen, and each [one] his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their lawless deeds I shall by no means remember anymore."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that He says, "A new [covenant],"He has made the first obsolete. And whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first [covenant] had ordinances of [divine] service and the earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tabernacle was prepared: the first [part], in which [were] both the lampstand and the table and the showbread, which is called the holy place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and after the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden altar, and the ark of the covenant having been overlaid on all sides with gold, in which [was] a golden jar holding the manna, and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tablets of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above it [were] cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; concerning these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second [part] the high priest [goes] alone once during the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the people's sins committed in ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which [was] symbolic for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are being offered, which are not able, in respect to conscience, to make perfect the [one] performing the service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>[concerned] only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances which are imposed until a time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ came [as] a High Priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those having been defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>by how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, will cleanse your conscience from dead works in order that we might serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And on account of this He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that, since a death has occurred for redemption of the transgressions at the time of the first covenant, that those having been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there [is] a testament, there is necessity for death to be offered of the [one] making the testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is valid over dead [people], since it is never valid when the [one] making the testament lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Therefore not even the first [covenant] has been dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according to law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore it [was] necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens to be continually purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into [the] holies made by hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holies every year with another's blood-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it would have been necessary [for] Him to suffer often from the foundation of the world; but now, once at the consummation of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men once to die and after this judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time apart from sin unto salvation, to those who eagerly await Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the image itself of the things, can never with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually every year, make those approaching perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise they would not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in them there is a reminder of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is not possible for [the] blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, when He entered into the world, He said: "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin You had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, 'Behold, I have come-In the volume of the book it is written of Me- To do Your will, O God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Earlier saying, "Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and [sacrifices] for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them"(which are offered according to the law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then He has said, "Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God."He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But He Himself, having offered one sacrifice for sins forever, He sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from that time waiting till His enemies are placed as a footstool for His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws on their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and their sins and their lawless deeds I shall by no means remember any longer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies having been washed with clean water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another for the stirring up of love and of good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, just as is the custom for some, but exhorting [one another], and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery zeal being about to devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone disregarding the law of Moses dies without compassions on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>By how much worse punishment, do you think, will he be deemed worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, and has regarded as common the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know Him who said, "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,"says the Lord. And again, "The LORD will judge His people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful [thing] to fall into the hands of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But remember the former days, in which after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle of sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>in part being exposed publicly, both to reproaches and to afflictions, and in part having become partners of those treated in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you sympathized with me in my chains, and you received the plunder of your possessions with joy, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and enduring possession in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has a great recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of endurance, so that having done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>"For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But the just shall live by faith, and if he withdraws, My soul has no pleasure in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of [those] shrinking back to destruction, but of faith, to the saving of the soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders obtained witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that time [itself] was framed by a command of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying concerning his gifts; and through it, although he died, he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated [so as] not to see death, "and he was not found, because God translated him"; for before his translation he had obtained witness that he was pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please [God], for it is necessary [for] the [one] approaching God to believe that He is, and that He becomes a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having being warned [by God] concerning the things[ ]not yet seen, being reverent, prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, through which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go forth to the place which he was about to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he migrated into a land of promise as [in] a foreign [land], dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>for he waited for the city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah herself also received power for conception of seed, and she bore a child past the normal age, because she regarded [Him] faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore even from one [man ]they were begotten, and him as good as dead, just as the stars of the sky in multitude, and innumerable as the sand by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died according to faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off and welcoming [them], and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those saying such things make evident that they seek a fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And indeed if they had remembered that land from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to turn back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they desire a better [land], that is, a heavenly [one]. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, had offered up Isaac, and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to have the temporary pleasure of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>regarding the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing the Unseen [One].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tried, they were slain, being murdered with the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, being afflicted, being ill treated,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>So therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every impediment, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as sons: "My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, nor be discouraged when you are reproved;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>For they indeed disciplined us for a few days, as seemed best to them, but He [disciplines us ]for [our] good, so that we may partake of His holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>Now no discipline seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, later it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those having been trained by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.12'>Therefore strengthen the hands which are weakened, and the feeble knees,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.7'>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you, of whom considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.8'>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Do not be carried away with various and strange doctrines. For it is good [for] the heart to be established by grace, not by foods, by which those having walked were not profited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>For of the animals, [whose ]blood is brought into the Holies by the high priest [as an offering ]for sin, the bodies [of these animals] are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>Therefore Jesus also, so that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Therefore let us go out to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For we have no permanent city, but we seek the [city ]which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>Therefore through Him let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>But do not forget the doing of good and generosity, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders, and submit to [them], for they keep watch over your souls, as giving an account, in order that they may do this with joy and not groaning, for this [would be] unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us; for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live commendably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>But I especially urge [you] to do this, in order that I may be restored to you more quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now may the God of peace, who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>And I appeal to you, brothers, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know [that] our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you, if he comes quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Greet all your leaders, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
