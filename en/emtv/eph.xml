        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He bestowed favor upon us in the Beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>for an administration of the fullness of the times, [He might ]bring together all things in Christ, those in heaven and those on the earth-in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>so that we should be to the praise of His glory, we who first trusted in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>in whom also you, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Because of this I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>do not cease to give thanks concerning you, making mention of you in my prayers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>the eyes of your heart having been enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which He worked in Christ, having raised Him from the dead, and seated [Him] at His right hand in the heavenlies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>above every ruler and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the coming [age].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is His body, the fullness of Him filling all things in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And you [He made alive,] being dead in transgressions and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which is now working in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the senses, and were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even when we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us up together, and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>that in the coming ages He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; [it is] the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, lest anyone should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are His handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh-who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made by hands in the flesh-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>that at that time you were apart from Christ, being estranged from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having hope and atheists in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have come to be near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and who destroyed the dividing wall of separation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that He might create in Himself one new man [from] the two, [thus] making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, putting to death the enmity in Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And having come, He preached peace to you who were far away and to those near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>Because through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>in whom the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom you also are being built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery, just as I wrote before briefly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>with reference to which, when you read, you can understand my insight in the mystery of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the Gentiles should be joint-heirs, and of the same body, and joint-partakers in His promise in Christ by the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I became a minister according to the free gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the working of His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to enlighten all [as to] what is the administration of the mystery, which had been hidden from the ages in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have the boldness and the access with confidence through faith in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I beseech [you] not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom every family in heaven and upon earth takes its name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; being rooted and founded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to Him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all humility and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the free gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore He says: "When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>But that "He ascended"-what is it but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He that descended, He is also the [One] who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the perfecting of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all arrive to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to [the] measure of [the] stature of the fullness of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>that we may no longer be infants, being tossed as by waves, and being carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in regard to deceitful scheming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but speaking the truth in love, we may grow up in all things into Him who is the head-Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the working of the measure of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the edification of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having been darkened in understanding, being estranged from the life of God, because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who, having become callous, gave themselves over to debauchery, for the working of uncleanness with utmost greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you did not thus learn Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed you have heard Him and were instructed by Him, just as the truth is in Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that you put off, concerning your former way of life, the old man which is being corrupted according to the deceitful lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and that you put on the new man which was created in the likeness of God, in true righteousness and holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, having put off falsehood, "Let each one speak truth with his neighbor,"for we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>"Be angry, and do not sin": do not let the sun set on your anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>nor give opportunity to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working that which is good with his hands, in order that he may have something to share with him who has need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt word proceed from your mouth, but only what is good for edification, that it may give grace to them that hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and blasphemy be removed from you, with all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as also God in Christ forgave us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>And walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>neither wickedness, nor foolish talk or coarse jesting, which are not proper, but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this you know, that no fornicator, or unclean person, nor covetous person, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore do not be participants with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no partnership with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is shameful even to speak of those things being done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore He says: "Awake, you who are sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that you walk carefully, not as unwise, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord [is].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And do not get drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always concerning all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>because the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But just as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives be to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your own wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>in order that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he that loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also the Lord does the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery, but I speak in reference to Christ and to the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless you also individually, let each one love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respect her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>"Honor your father and mother,"which is the first commandment with a promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>"that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in simplicity of heart, as to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God wholeheartedly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good thing anyone does, the same he shall receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And masters, do the same things towards them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual [forces] of evil in the heavenlies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Because of this, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having accomplished all things, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>through every prayer and petition, praying in every season in the Spirit, being watchful to this same thing with all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.19'>and for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.20'>for the sake of which I serve as an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I must speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.21'>But that you also may know my circumstances, and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make all things known to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.22'>whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our situation, and that he may comfort your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.23'>Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.24'>Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</verse>
