        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered David the king. David the king fathered Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the captivity in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham till David [were] fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon [were] fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ [were] fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to make her a public example, purposed to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take unto [you] Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He shall save His people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this came to pass that the thing spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,"which is translated, "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, having been aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had ordered him and took to [him] his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but did not know her till she brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East arrived in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, secretly having called the wise men, ascertained from them the time that the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and carefully search for the young Child, and as soon as you find [Him], report back to me, so that I also may come and worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And having come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and falling down, they worshipped Him, and opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And having been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew into their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, and take along the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to seek the young Child to destroy Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he arose, he took along the young Child and His mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent and executed all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Now after Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, "Arise, and take with [you] the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the young Child have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Then he rose and took along the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being divinely instructed in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And when he arrived, he settled down in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He would be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Baptist arrived preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And John himself had his clothing [made] from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan were going out to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and He will gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus arrived from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John [tried to ]prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."Then he permitted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, a voice came out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I have found delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And approaching Him, the tempter said, "If You are the Son of God, speak so that these stones may become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: 'He shall give His angels orders concerning you,' and, 'In their hands they will lift you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not tempt the LORD your God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he said to Him, "All these things will I give You, if You will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him alone you shall serve.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He departed into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth behind, He came and settled down in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to those who sat in the land and the shadow of death, light sprang up on them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Now as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>Then He said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They immediately left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having gone forth from there, He saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And the report of Him went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all those who were ill, and [who were ]suffering with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And large crowds followed Him from Galilee and from Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain, and after He had sat down, His disciples approached Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And opening His mouth, He began to teach them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed [are] the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed [are] those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed [are] the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed [are] those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed [are] the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed [are] the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed [are] the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed [are] those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you whenever they revile you, and they persecute you, and they say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and to be trampled underfoot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and they may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all things are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men thus, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does [them] and teaches [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not kill,' and whoever kills will be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Empty-head!' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, ' fool!' will be liable to the fiery hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Make friends with your adversary quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery [with] her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"Furthermore it has been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorcee commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not swear falsely, but you shall pay your oaths to the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>"But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be 'Yes', 'yes,'; [or ]'No,' 'no.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you not to resist an evil person. But whoever shall slap you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And to the [one] desiring to sue you and to take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>"Take care not to be doing your charitable giving before men, so as to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have not a reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Whenever therefore you do charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. Assuredly I say to you, they receive their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will Himself reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>"And whenever you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and on the streetcorners, so that they may be seen by men. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, whenever you pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows what things[ ]you have need of before you ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as [it is ]in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our daily bread.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>"Moreover, when you fast, do not become gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men [to be] fasting. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>"Because of this I say to you, do not worry [about ]your life-what you shall eat, or what you shall drink-nor [about] your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food and the body [more than] clothing?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we put on?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own affairs. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And reaching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed."Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Now when He had entered Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, begging Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, "Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being tormented terribly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this [one], 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you that many shall come from east and west, and recline [to eat] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; and as you believed, may it be unto you."And his servant was healed that same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother having been laid up, and burning with fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up, and began to serve Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and He healed all that were ill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>Then a certain scribe approached, and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Then another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by waves; but He was sleeping.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O [you] of little faith?"Then having risen, He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>So the men marveled, saying, "What kind [of Man] is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when He came to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, [there] met Him two demon-possessed [men], coming out of the tombs; exceedingly violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>So the demons implored Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go off into the herd of swine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And He said to them, "Go."So they came out, and went off into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed violently down the steep bank into the sea, and died in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Then those who tended them fled; and going off into the city, they reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And seeing Him, they implored Him that He might go away from their region.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And getting into the boat, He crossed over and went into His own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold, they were carrying a paralytic to Him lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Have courage, child; your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And at once some of the scribes said among themselves, "This Man blasphemes!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And having arisen, he went off to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>Now when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Now it came to pass, as He reclined [to eat] in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were reclining [to eat] with Jesus and His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>When Jesus heard that, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then the disciples of John approached Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No one puts on a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for it takes away its completeness from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>As He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain leader came and worshipped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>So Jesus arose and followed him, likewise His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold, a woman hemorrhaging for twelve years, approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she said to herself, "If only I may touch His garment, I will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you."And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came into the house of the leader, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said to them, "Make room, for the girl has not died, but she is sleeping."And they were ridiculing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd had been put out, He went in and grasped her hand, and the little girl arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the report of this went out into that whole land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind [men] followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have pity on us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when He came into the house, the blind [men] approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it be unto you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See [that you] let no one know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they, having gone out, spread the news about Him in that whole land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man, being demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "It was never seen like this in Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every illness and every disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and prostrated, like sheep having no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then He said to His disciples, "Indeed the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, and they brought to Him all those who were ill,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, with death let him die.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw [it] to the little dogs."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were assembled into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and plotted to take Jesus by guile and kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a disturbance take place among the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>And when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to Him having an alabaster [flask] of very expensive perfume, and she began to pour it on His head as He reclined to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when His disciples saw it, they became indignant, saying, "Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this perfume could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But when Jesus became aware of it, He said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful work for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For this [woman], having put this perfume on My body, she did [it] for My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Assuredly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this [woman] did will be spoken as a memorial to her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?"And they weighed out for him thirty silver [coins].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from then [on] he sought an opportunity to betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do You desire [that] we shall prepare for You to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; at your house I will keep the Passover with My disciples."' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, He was reclining [to eat] with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>Now while they were eating, He said, "Assuredly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And becoming exceedingly sorrowful, each of them began to say to Him, "[Surely] not I am [the one], Lord?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered and said, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl will betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>Indeed, the Son of Man goes just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas, the [one] betraying Him, answered and said, "[Surely ]not I am [the one], Rabbi?"He said to him, "You have said [it]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and giving thanks, He broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink of it, all [of you],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many, for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will by no means drink of this fruit of the vine from now [on,] until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And having sung hymns, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me on this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered and said to Him, "Even if all are made to stumble because of You, yet I will never be made to stumble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you that on this night, before [the] rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, by no means will I deny You!"And likewise said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go off and pray [over] there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then Jesus said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You [will]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What? Were you not strong [enough] to watch with Me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Indeed the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And He came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, He went away again, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep now, and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise up, let us be going. See, he who betrays Me is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, [sent] from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the [one] betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is [the One]; seize Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!"and kissed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?"Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I cannot now call upon My Father, and He will furnish Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to arrest Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled."Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And those having seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter was following Him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. And entering inside, he sat down with the attendants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the Sanhedrin were seeking false witnesses against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and they did not find [any]. And though many false witnesses came forward, they did not find [any]. But at last two false witnesses came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This [Man] said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And standing up the high priest said to Him, "Do You answer nothing? What is it these men are testifying against You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "You said [it]. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now [on,] you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?"They answered and said, "He is deserving of death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in His face, and beat Him with [their] fists; and they slapped [Him,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is he that struck You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another [girl] saw him and said to them there, "This [man] was with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>But again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little [while], those standing by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the Man!"And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."And going out, he wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus, so as to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, the [one] betraying Him, seeing that He was condemned, feeling regret, returned the thirty silver [coins] to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."And they said, "What is [that] to us? You see to it!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And throwing the silver [coins] in the sanctuary, he departed; and going away, he hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests, taking the silver [coins] said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since they are the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And taking counsel, they bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled the thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty [coins], the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the sons of Israel priced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>"and they gave them for the potter's field, as the LORD directed me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"So Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And He answered him not one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you wish [that] I should release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but they should destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?"They said, "Barabbas!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>Then the governor said, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate, seeing that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was starting, taking water, he washed his hands clean in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just [Man]. You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, "His blood [be] on us and on our children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, gathered the whole garrison around Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting on Him, they took the reed and were striking [Him] on His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, and dressed Him in His own clothes, and led Him away in order to crucify [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they pressed into service that he might carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But having tasted it, He would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes among themselves,[ ]casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down, they guarded Him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up over His head the crime having been written [against] Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then they crucified two thieves with Him, one on His right, and another on His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You[ ]who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him ]with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He'll [have] Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Even the thieves who were crucified with Him were reviling Him with the same [insult].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came upon all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?"that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of those standing [by], when they heard this, said, "This [Man] is calling Elijah!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it around a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said, "Leave [Him] alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>But Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, released His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had passed away were raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>So when the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were greatly afraid, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were many women there observing from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This [man] went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and placed it in his new tomb which he had cut in the rock; and having rolled a large stone [against] the door of the tomb, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>On the next day, which is after the Preparation [Day], the chief priests and Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while He was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>"Therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him, and say to the people, 'He was raised from the dead.' So the last deception will be worse [than] the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go make it as secure as you know [how]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they were going to report to His disciples, that behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"So they came and held His feet and worshipped Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>When they had assembled with the elders and taking counsel, they gave sufficient silver [coins] to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>"And if this reaches the governor's ears, we will influence him and make you secure."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this saying has been widely spread among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."Amen.</verse>
