        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are obligated to give thanks to God always for you, brothers, [and ]rightfully so, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all increases towards one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves are boasting in you among the churches of God about your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>[which is] evidence of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, on behalf of which you also suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give you who are being afflicted rest along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His mighty angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>These shall pay a penalty-eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>whenever He comes, in that Day, to be glorified among His saints and to be marveled among all those having believed, because our testimony among you was believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Therefore we also pray always concerning you that our God may count you worthy of [this] calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>in order that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we beseech you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>not to be quickly shaken from your mind, nor be disturbed, neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter, as if from us, [as though] the day of Christ has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one deceive you by any means; for [that day will not come] unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is unveiled, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or [every] object of worship, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you know that which is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains [will continue ]until one arises from out of [the] midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the lawless one will be unveiled, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth, and will destroy by the brightness of His coming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>whose coming is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and in all deception of unrighteousness among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And because of this, God will send them strong delusion, in order for them to believe the lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>so that they all might be damned who did not believe the truth, but delighted in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are obligated to give thanks to God always for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>to which He called you through our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brothers, stand fast and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and a good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as [it is ]with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked men; for not all have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and will guard you from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that the[ ]things which we command to you, you are both doing, and will do [them.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother living in idleness, and not according to the tradition which they received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat bread from anyone without paying, but in labor and hardship, working night and day, so as not to be a burden to any of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>not because we do not have authority, but in order that we may give ourselves as a pattern to you, so that you might follow us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone is not willing to work, neither let him eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear [that] some are walking among you in a disorderly way, not working at all, but being busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>And to such [people] we command and urge by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But as for you, brothers, do not lose heart [in] doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>Now if anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him, and do not associate with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not consider him as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The greeting of Paul by my own hand, which is a sign in every letter; so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
