        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Jude'>
      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, having been sanctified by God the Father, and having been kept in Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>[May ]mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you about our common salvation, it became necessary to write to you exhorting you to earnestly contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For certain men have crept in unawares, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, changing the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying the only Master God and our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>Now I want to remind you, although you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>And the angels who did not keep their own domain, but rather having left their own habitation, He has kept with everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to fornication and having gone after other flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>Likewise indeed even these [filthy ]dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>Yet Michael the archangel, when taking issue with the devil, was arguing about the body of Moses, dared not to bring a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But these speak blasphemously of those things which they do not know; but what they do know naturally, like unreasoning animals, they are destroyed by these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, and in the error of Balaam they have rushed for profit, and have perished in the rebellion of Korah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are stains in your love feasts, while they feast [with you] without fear, caring for themselves, they are waterless clouds being carried along by winds; late autumn trees unfruitful, twice having died, having been uprooted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>raging waves on the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars for whom the darkness of the netherworld has been reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly among them about all their ungodly deeds which they have committed impiously, and about all the harsh [words] which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks puffed up words, flattering people to gain advantage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>how they told you that in the last time there would be mockers, walking according to their own ungodly lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are those who cause divisions, wordly, devoid of [the] Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>keep yourselves in the love of God, anticipating the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>And have mercy on some, making a distinction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>but others save with fear, snatching them out of the fire, hating even the garment having been stained by the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>Now to Him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to make you stand before His glory, blameless with exultation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>To the only wise God our Savior, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.</verse>
