        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, together with the overseers and ministers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every prayer of mine in behalf of you all, with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>having been persuaded of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>just as it is right for me to think this concerning you all, because I have you in my heart, both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all perception,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>having been filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I want you to know, brothers, that the things [which happened ]to me have come about for the advancement of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and most of the brothers in the Lord, having been persuaded by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The [former ]proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? Nevertheless in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be ashamed, but with utmost boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me, to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I am to live on in the flesh, this to me will mean fruit from my labor; and what I shall choose I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am hard pressed by the two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, [which is] far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And having been persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my coming again to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only conduct yourselves worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not being terrified in anything by your enemies, which is to them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and this from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same struggle which you saw in me and now you hear is in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and acts of compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit, intending the same purpose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>doing nothing according to selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility, regarding one another as being better than yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Let each of you look out not only for his own concerns, but also for the concerns of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, existing in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming to be in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore God also has highly exalted Him, and has graciously given Him a name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and [that ]every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for it is God who is working in you, both to will and to do for His good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without grumbling and disputing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>in order that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as light bearers in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But even if I am being poured upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice; [yea,] and I rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same reason you also rejoice and rejoice together with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your circumstances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like-minded, who will be genuinely concerned about your circumstances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own interests, not the things of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>And you know his approved character, that as a child with his father he served as a slave for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I may see how my circumstances go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I have been persuaded in the Lord that I myself will also come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, [and ]near death; but God showed mercy [on] him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I sent him more eagerly, in order that when you see him again you may have joy, and I may be less anxious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with the utmost joy, and hold such [ones] in honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, being careless with his life, in order that he might fill up that which was lacking in your service to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not troublesome, but for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the [false] circumcision!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the [true] circumcision, worshipping by the Spirit of God, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>although I also [am] having confidence in the flesh. If any other [person] thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I even more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; with respect to the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>with respect to zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But such things as were gain to me, these I have considered loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>More than that I also consider all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have sustained the loss of all things, and I consider them to be rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through [the] faith of Christ, the righteousness [which is] of God by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>[so as] to know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if in some way I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained, or have already been made perfect; but I press on, if also I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing[ I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore, as many as are mature, let us think this way; and if in anything you think otherwise, even this God will reveal to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, to what we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, [being] of the same mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Be fellow imitators of me, brothers, and look out for those walking this way, just as you have us for a pattern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many walk, of whom often I was speaking to you, and now even weeping I tell you, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame-who are mindful of earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our lowly body, that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my beloved and longed for brothers, my joy and crown, in this way stand fast in the Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women who labored together with me in the gospel, and with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and petition, along with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, as many things as are true, as many as are honorable, as many as are just, as many as are pure, as many as are lovely-if there is any virtue and if there is any praise-meditate on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, practice these things; and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now once [again] you have revived your mindfulness on my behalf, inasmuch as indeed you were mindful, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I am speaking with respect to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In every place and in all [circumstances] I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you Philippians also know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church shared with me in an accounting of giving and receiving except you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>Because even in Thessalonica, both once and again you sent for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which is increasing to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>And I have all things and abound. I have been made full, having received from Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, but especially those of the household of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
