        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came to be through Him, and without Him nothing came to be which has come to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not apprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This [man] came for a testimony, so that he might testify concerning the Light, so that all through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but [was sent] so that he might testify concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true Light which lightens every man coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came to be through Him, and the world did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received Him, He gave them the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified concerning Him and has cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me, has come to be before me, because He was before me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And out of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Messiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"He said, "I am not.""Are you the Prophet?"And he answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, "Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said: "I am 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Make straight the way of the LORD,"' just as Isaiah the prophet said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now those who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He is the [One ]who comes after me, who has come to be before me, of whom I am not worthy that I should loose the strap of His sandal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things happened in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is the [One] about whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who ranks before me, because He was before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>"I did not know Him; but that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, "I have beheld the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>"And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking at Jesus as He [was] walking, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned and observed them following, and said to them, "What are you seeking?"They said to Him, "Rabbi"(which is translated, Teacher), "where are You staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, "Come and see."They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah"(which is translated, the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he led him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas"(which is translated, A Stone).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day He wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, "Follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found the [One] about whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the Prophets-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to Him, "From where do You know me?"Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And He said to him, "Most assuredly I say to you, from now on you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine had given out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour has not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He may say to you, do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six stone water jars standing there, according to the purification rites of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, "Fill the water jars with water."And they filled them up to the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And He said to them, "Draw out now, and carry [some] to the head steward."And they carried [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the head steward called the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, "Every man first sets out the good wine, and when they have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and there they remained not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And having made a scourge out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and He overturned the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And He said to those selling the doves, "Take these things [away] from here! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>Then His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal for Your house will consume Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Therefore the Jews answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But He was speaking about the temple of His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>Therefore, when He was raised up from among the dead, His disciples remembered that He spoke this [thing,] and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed on His name, beholding the signs which He was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew all [men],</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and had no need that anyone should testify concerning man, for He himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees whose name [was] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This [man] came to Him by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God [as] a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born, being old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>"The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its sound, but you do not know from where it comes and where it goes. So is everyone who has been born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Most assuredly I say to you, that which We know, We speak, and that which We have seen, We bear witness to, and you do not receive Our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has gone up into heaven except He who came down out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son into the world so that He might condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than the light, because their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone that does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus, along with His disciples, came into the land of Judea, and there He was staying with them and He was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salem, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there came to be a dispute between John's disciples and a Jew about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified-behold, this [Man] is baptizing, and all [men] are coming to Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves bear witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before Him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore my joy has been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who receives His testimony has certified that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; and he who does not believe the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and was baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea and went away into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>But He needed to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Therefore He came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near the piece of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Therefore Jesus, having become tired from the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For His disciples had gone away into the city, that they might buy provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, "If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given to you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are You greater than our father Jacob,[ ]who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water which I shall give him will by no means ever thirst again. But the water which I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, "I have no husband."Jesus said to her, "You have said well, 'I have no husband,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>"for you have had five husbands, and [the one] whom you now have is not your husband; in this you have said truly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and you [Jews] say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know; we [Jews ]worship what we know, because salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God [is] Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming"(who is called Christ). "When He comes, He will proclaim to us all things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, "I am [He,] the [One ]speaking to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; however no one said, "What do You seek?"or, "Why are You speaking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her water jar, went her way into the city, and said to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a Man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city and were coming to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>But in the meantime the disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But He said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore the disciples were saying to one another, "Has anyone brought Him [something] to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, 'There are still four months and the harvest comes'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, for they are already white for harvest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who[ ]reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman testifying, "He told me everything I ever did."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of His word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>Then they were saying to the woman, "No longer because of your speech do we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after the two days He went out from there and went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Therefore when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things which He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him that He might come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you [people] see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, "Go; your son lives."And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And already as he was going, his servants met him and reported, saying, "Your child lives!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he inquired from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Therefore the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives."And he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This again is the second sign Jesus did, after He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep [Gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these [porches] were lying a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel from time to[ ]time descended into the pool and stirred up the water; therefore the first [one] having gone in after the stirring up of the water, became well of whatever disease he was suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>Now there was a certain man there who had an ailment [for ]thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw this [man] lying there, and knew that he already had been in [that condition] a long time, He said to him, "Do you wish to become well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I do not have a man, so that whenever the water is stirred up, he may put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another descends before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man became well, and took up his bed, and began to walk. And that day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Therefore the Jews said to the man who was healed, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, "He that made me whole, He said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, "Who is the Man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had turned aside, while a crowd was in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the [One ]who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, and were seeking to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Because of this the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but also He called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows to Him all things which He Himself does; and greater works than these He will show Him, so that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises up the dead and gives life, thus also the Son gives life to whom He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no one, but He has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>"Most assuredly I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Most assuredly I say to you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those having heard shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear His voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth-those who have done good, to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to a resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of My own self do nothing. Even as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>"If I testify of Myself, My testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony which He testifies concerning Me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not receive the testimony from man, but these things I say so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a testimony greater than John's; for the works which the Father gave to Me, that I should complete them, these very works which I do, testify of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>But you do not have His word abiding in you, because [Him ]whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the Scriptures, because you think [that] in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>But you are unwilling to come to Me, so that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I have known you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you-Moses, in whom you have hoped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would have believed Me; for he wrote about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, that is, of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a large crowd was following Him, because they were seeing His signs which He was doing upon those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread, that these [people ]may eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii [worth of] bread is not enough for them, that each of them might receive a little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they for so many?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Then Jesus said, "Make the people to recline."Now there was much grass in that place. Therefore the men reclined, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>But when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments, so that nothing may be lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered [them] up, and they filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Therefore Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him king, withdrew to the mountain by Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and having entered into the boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had already come, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea was agitated by a great blowing wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Therefore having rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But He said to them, "[It is] I AM; do not fear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat arrived at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, when the crowd which had remained on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there, except that one in which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone-</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks-</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when the crowd therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And having found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for [upon] Him God the Father has set [His] seal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to Him, "What should we do, that we may work the works of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>Therefore they said to Him, "What sign will You do then, so that we may see it and believe You? What work do You perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to Him, "Lord, give us this bread always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I told you that you have both seen Me and you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Therefore the Jews were murmuring about Him, because He said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does this [Man] say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me should draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught of God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Most assuredly I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Therefore the Jews were contending with one another, saying, "How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For My flesh truly is food, and My blood truly is drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He that eats this bread shall live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying; who can hear it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>And Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, He said to them, "Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit who makes alive; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe."For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe, and who was the one who would betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And He said, "Because of this I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this [time] many of His disciples turned back and no longer would walk with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also want to go away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>But Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>He answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Now He was speaking [about] Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon, for he was intending to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And after these things Jesus was walking in Galilee; for He did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers therefore said to Him, "Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For not even His brothers believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when His brothers had gone up, then also He Himself went up to the feast, not openly, but as [it were] in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Then the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and said, "Where is He?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning Him. Some on the one hand were saying, "He is a good [Man]"; [while ]others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He deceives the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>But now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews were marveling, saying, "How is this Man learned, since He has not been educated?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, "How long will You hold us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, these things testify about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, just as I said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father, who has given [them] to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of My Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, "Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered Him, saying, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If He called those gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I am not doing the works of My Father, do not believe Me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>but if I am doing [them], even if you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, but He escaped from their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to Him and said, "John indeed performed no sign, but everything which John said about this [Man] was true."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed in Him there.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>Now it was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with myrrh, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, [he] whom You love is sick."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>And when Jesus heard, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>Therefore when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed in the place where He was [for ]two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this He said to the disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, [just] now the Jews were seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things He said, and after this He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awaken him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will get well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>However, Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about resting in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Therefore when He had come, Jesus found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews had come to the [women] around Martha and Mary, so that they might console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever You may ask of God, God will give You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these things, she went out and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were with her in the house and consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb, so that she may weep there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, seeing Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And He said, "Where have you laid him?"They said to Him, "Lord, come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Therefore the Jews were saying, "Look how He loved him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, "Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have done [something] to keep this man from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, "Take away the stone."Martha, the sister of the [one] having died, said to Him, "Lord, already there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that You always hear Me, but because of the people standing around I said [this], so that they may believe that You sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And the [one] having died came out, bound hands and feet with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let [him] go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and seeing the things which Jesus had done, believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, "What are we doing? For this Man works many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we leave Him alone in this way, all will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You don't know anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now this he did not say on his own, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Therefore from that day [on] they took counsel together, that they might kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but He went away from there into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then they were seeking Jesus, and they were speaking with one another, standing in the temple, "What do you think-that He will definitely not come to the feast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report [it], so that they might seize Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had died, whom He raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>Then they made for Him a supper there; and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining [to eat] with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, having taken a pound of very costly pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, [son ]of Simon, who was about to betray Him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to pilfer the things which were placed in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now a large crowd from the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel, that they might also kill Lazarus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going [away], and were believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day a large crowd which was coming to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and they were crying out, "Hosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!' The King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, he sat on it; as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and they did these things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Therefore the crowd which was with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, was testifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>On account of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are not doing any good. Look, the world has gone after Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were some Greeks among those coming up, so that they might worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>Then they approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Most assuredly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>And if anyone serve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant shall be also. If anyone serve Me, him My Father will honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>"Now My soul has been troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Your name."Then a voice came out of heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify [it] again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Therefore the crowd which was standing and heard were saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come for My sake, but for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [peoples] to Myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This He said, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered Him, "We heard from the law that the Christ abides forever; and so how do You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, "[For] yet a little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light."These things Jesus spoke, and departing, He was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But even though He had done so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even from among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be excommunicated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in Me may not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him-the word which I spoke, that [word] will judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken on My own [authority]; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, as the Father has said to Me, thus I speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And after supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>He rose from the supper and laid aside His garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to dry [them] with the towel with which He was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!"Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, "He that is bathed need only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, "You are not all clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So when He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments, He reclined again, and said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say correctly, for so I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Most assuredly I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than he who sent him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I do not speak concerning all of you. I know [those] whom I chose; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in His spirit, and testified and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Therefore the disciples were looking at one another, perplexed about whom He was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now there was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, [the one ]whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Then, leaning back thus on Jesus' chest, he said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, "It is the [one] to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it."And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some were thinking, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy [the ]things of which we need for the feast,"or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Therefore they said to him, "You are not also [one] of His disciples, [are you]?"Then he denied it and said, "I am not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter then denied again; and immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium, lest they might be defiled, but so that they might eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Then Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, "If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him over to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Then Pilate said to them, "You take Him and judge Him according to your law."Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to kill anyone,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He said, signifying by what sort of death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, "For yourself do you say this, or did others tell you about Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I might not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to Him, "Are You a king then?"Jesus answered, "You say [rightly] that I am a king. For this [reason] I have been born, and for this [reason] I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to Him, "What is truth?"And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no fault in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>"But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you wish [that] I should release the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried out again, saying, "Not this [Man], but Barabbas!"Now Barabbas was a bandit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>So then Pilate took Jesus and flogged [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers twisted a crown out of thorns and put it on His head, and they put a purple robe around Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And they kept saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"And they were striking Him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, so that you may know that I find no fault in Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, "Behold, the Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>Therefore, when the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "You take Him and crucify [Him], for I find no fault in Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was [even] more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?"But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and I have authority to release You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, "You would have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore the one who betrayed Me to you has a greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this [point ]Pilate was seeking to release Him, but the Jews kept crying out, saying, "If you release this [Man], you are no friend of Caesar's. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Therefore Pilate, having heard this saying, led Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place that is called [The] Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation [Day] of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, "Away [with Him], away [with Him]! Crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led [Him ]away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Now Pilate wrote a title and he put [it] on the cross. And it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Then many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am the King of the Jews."' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top in one piece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>Therefore they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it will be,"so that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots."Therefore the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Therefore Jesus, seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold your son!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then He said to the disciple, "Behold your mother!"And from that hour that disciple took her into his own [care].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, seeing that all things already had been fulfilled, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He said, "I thirst!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now a vessel was set full of sour wine; and they, having filled a sponge with sour wine, put it around a hyssop, they held it to His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Therefore when Jesus received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!"And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Therefore the Jews, since it was the Preparation [Day], that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and they broke the legs of the first [man,] and of the other who was crucified with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But having come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he tells the truth, so that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, "Not a bone of His shall be broken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look at [Him] whom they pierced."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these things[,] Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen strips with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation Day, because the tomb was near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two together were running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen strips lying there; however he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he saw the linen strips lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the facecloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen strips, but apart from [them,] having been rolled up in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside facing the tomb weeping. Therefore as she was weeping, she stooped down [and] [looked] into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>Then they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And having said these things, she turned back and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?"She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, "Sir, if You carried Him away, tell me where You put Him, and I will take Him away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, "Mary!"She turned and said to Him, "Rabboni!"(which means, Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene went reporting to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] He had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Therefore Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you! Just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain [the sins] of any, they have been retained."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, the [one ]called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord."So he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been closed, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here, and see My hands; and bring your hand here, and put [it] into My side. Be not unbelieving, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that [by ]believing you may have life in His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this manner He showed Himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing."They said to him, "We are coming with you also."They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But as daybreak had already come, Jesus stood upon the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus said to them, "Children, have you any food?"They answered Him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find [some]."Therefore they cast, and they were not able to haul it in because of the multitude of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and he threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then as they got off onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and fish placed on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, "Bring [some] of the fish which you have just caught."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and hauled the net onto the land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, "Come, eat breakfast."Yet none of the disciples dared to question Him, "Who are You?"-knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This [was] now the third time Jesus was manifested to His disciples, having been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?"He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I care for You."He said to him, "Feed My lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me?"He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I care for You."He said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you care for Me?"Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you care for Me?"And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I care for You."Jesus said to him, "Feed My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Most assuredly I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and used to walk where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and will carry [you] where you do not wish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>But this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, "Follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had reclined on His chest at the supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "But Lord, what [about] this [man]?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you? You follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Therefore this saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would have room for the books which would be written. Amen.</verse>
