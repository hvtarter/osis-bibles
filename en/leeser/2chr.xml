      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and caused him to become exceedingly great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Then said Solomon unto all Israel, to the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the chiefs of the family divisions that they should go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>Thereupon went Solomon, and all the assembly with him, to the highplace that was at Gibon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>Nevertheless the ark of God had David brought up from Kiryathyearim to the place which David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>But the copper altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, had made, he placed before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the assembly sought for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon sacrificed there on the copper altar before the Lord, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered upon it a thousand burntofferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shown unto David my father great kindness, and hast made me king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O Lord God, let thy word unto David my father be verified; for thou hast made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who could otherwise judge this thy great people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said unto Solomon, Whereas this hath been in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, and hast not even asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>Therefore are the wisdom and the knowledge granted unto thee; and riches, and wealth, and honor, will I give thee, such as no kings that have been before thee have had, and the like of which after thee none shall have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then came Solomon from the highplace that was at Gibon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon brought together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariotcities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king rendered the silver and gold at Jerusalem like stones, and cedartrees he rendered as the sycamoretrees that are in the lowlands for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had his horses brought out of Egypt; a company of the kings merchants bought a quantity at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they brought up, and fetched out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>
          <note>(1:18)</note> And Solomon ordered to build a house for the name of the Lord, and a house for his royal residence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>
          <note>(2:1)</note> And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and as superintendents over them three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>
          <note>(2:2)</note> And Solomon sent to Churam the king of Tyre, saying, As thou hast dealt with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>
          <note>(2:3)</note> Behold, I am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to sanctify it to him, to burn before him incense of spices, and for the continual rows of showbread, and for the burntofferings at morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the newmoons, and on the stated festivals of the Lord our God: this being for ever obligatory on Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>
          <note>(2:4)</note> And the house which I am building is great; for greater is our God than all the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>
          <note>(2:5)</note> But who possesseth the power to build him a house? for the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: and who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>
          <note>(2:6)</note> And now send me a skilful man to work in gold, and in silver and in copper, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that understandeth how to engrave with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my father hath provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>
          <note>(2:7)</note> Send me also cedartrees, firtrees, and sandalwood, from the Lebanon; for I know well that thy servants have the skill to cut the trees of Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>
          <note>(2:8)</note> Even to prepare for me timber in abundance; for the house which I am building is to be wonderfully great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>
          <note>(2:9)</note> And, behold, for the hewers that cut the timber will I give unto thy servants twenty thousand cors of threshed wheat, and twenty thousand cors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>
          <note>(2:10)</note> Then answered Churam the king of Tyre in writing, and he sent it to Solomon, Out of the love of the Lord for his people hath he set thee as king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>
          <note>(2:11)</note> And Churam said, Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, that hath made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to king David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and understanding, who is to build a house unto the Lord, and a house for royal residence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>
          <note>(2:12)</note> And now have I sent a skilful man, endowed with understanding, namely, ChuramAbi,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>
          <note>(2:13)</note> The son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, while his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in copper, in iron, in stone, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to execute any manner of engraving, and to devise every kind of work of art which may be given to him, together with thy skilful men, and skilful men of my lord David thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>
          <note>(2:14)</note> And now the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, of which my lord hath spoken, let him send unto his servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>
          <note>(2:15)</note> And we will truly cut down trees out of the Lebanon, as much as thou mayest need; and we will bring them to thee in boats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry them up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>
          <note>(2:16)</note> And Solomon numbered all the strange men that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found to be one hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>
          <note>(2:17)</note> And he made of them seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred superintendents to set the people to work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where He had appeared unto David his father, on the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build on the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now in this manner was the foundation laid of the house of God at its building by Solomon: The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that was in the front of the length was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the great house he ceiled with firwood, which he overlaid with pure gold, and he wrought thereon palmtrees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he overlaid the house with costly stones for ornament: and the gold was gold of Parvayim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>And he covered the house, the beams, the sills, and its walls, and its doors, with gold: and he engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy house, its length being in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits: and he covered it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails amounted to fifty shekels of gold. And the upper chambers he covered with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And he made in the most holy house two cherubim of sculpture work, and they overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And regarding the wings of the cherubim their length was twenty cubits; the wing of the one amounting to five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing of five cubits was joined closely to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim as they were spread out were twenty cubits: and they were standing on their feet, and their faces were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought thereon cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>And he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits in length, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains in the debir; and others which he placed on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and placed them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and he called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>He made also an altar of copper, twenty cubits being its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>He made also the molten sea, being ten cubits from the one brim to the other, rounded all about, and it was five cubits in height: and a line of thirty cubits did encompass it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And likenesses of oxen were under it, encompassing it all round about, ten in a cubit, encircling the sea round about: the oxen were in two rows and were cast with it, when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It was standing upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was resting above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And its thickness was a hands breadth, and its brim like the brim of a cup, with lilybuds; and it could hold and contain three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He made also ten lavers; and he placed five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: what belonged to the burntoffering they rinsed off at them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their prescribed manner: and he placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He made also ten tables, and he set them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred bowls of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>And he made the court of the priests, and the great outcourt, and doors for the outcourt, and their doors he overlaid with copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And the sea he placed on the right side toward the east, opposite to the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Churam made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Churam made an end of doing the work which he made for king Solomon in the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>The two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the bowlshaped capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>And the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowlshaped capitals which were upon the front of the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>The bases also did he make, and the lavers made he upon the bases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>The one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>And the pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments, did ChuramAbiv make for king Solomon for the house of the Lord, of polished copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clayground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>And Solomon made all these vessels in very great abundance; for the weight of the copper was not inquired into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of God; and the altar of gold also, and the tables whereon the showbread was set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>And the candlesticks with their lamps, to light them after the prescribed manner before the debir, of pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, were of gold, the purest of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>And the knives, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers were of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>And so was ended all the work which Solomon made for the house of the Lord; and Solomon brought in the things sanctified by David his father; and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he placed in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the divisions of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast which is in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle: these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, which could not be numbered nor told for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto its place, into the debir of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>And the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And they had made the staves so long that the ends of the staves were seen standing out from the ark in the front of the debir; but they were not seen without; and they have remained there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses had placed therein at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place; for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, the divisions not having been observed; </verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>And the Levites the singers, all together, of Assaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east side of the altar, and with them were one hundred and twenty priests blowing on trumpets; </verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>And it came thus to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice accompanied with trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and in praising the Lord, For he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his kindness: that the house, even the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then said Solomon, "The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>And I have indeed built a dwellinghouse for thee, and have settled a place for thy abode for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel was standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I did not make choice of any city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; nor did I make choice of any man to be a ruler over my people of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But I have made choice of Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have made choice of David to be over my people Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>Nevertheless thou shalt not thyself build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>And the Lord hath fulfilled his word that he hath spoken; and I am risen up in the stead of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord hath spoken, and I have built the house unto the name of the Lord the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And I have placed there the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord which he hath made with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he now placed himself before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>For Solomon had made a laver of copper, and had placed it in the midst of the outcourt, five cubits being its length, five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height; and he placed himself upon it, and kneeled down upon his knees in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And he said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like thee in the heavens, or on the earth, thou who keepest the covenant, and the kindness for thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>Who has kept for thy servant David my father that which thou hadst promised him; and thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>And now, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father that which thou hast spoken concerning him, saying, There shall never fail thee a man in my sight who sitteth on the throne of Israel, if thy children but take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>And now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant, unto David.</verse>
