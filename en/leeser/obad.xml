        <verse osisID='Obad.1.5'>How? are thieves come to thee? or nightprowling robbers? how destroyed art thou! would they not have stolen till they had enough? if grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left some gleanings?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Obad.1.7'>Up to the border have accompanied thee all the men of thy confederacy; beguiled, overcome thee have the men that were at peace with thee: they that eat thy bread have struck thee secretly a wound. There is no understanding in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>But thou shouldst not have looked on pleased at the day of thy brother, on the day that he was delivered up to strangers; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction; nor should thou have spoken proudly on the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>Thou shouldst not have entered into the gate of my people on the day of their calamity; yea, thou too shouldst not have looked pleased on their affliction on the day of their calamity; nor have laid hands on their army on the day of their calamity;</verse>
