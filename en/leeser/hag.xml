      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of king Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord through means of Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, This people have said, The time is not yet come, the time for the Lords house to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>And the word of the Lord came by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth in ruins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore, thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Direct your heart unto your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but it doth not satisfy hunger; ye drink, but it doth not appease thirst; ye clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he that earneth something earneth it for a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Direct your heart to your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house: that I may take pleasure in it, and be glorified, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>Till now ye looked for much, and lo, it came to be little; and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it. For what cause? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lieth in ruins, while ye run every man unto his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore do the heavens for your sake withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth her products.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought over the land, and over the mountains, and over the corn, and over the new wine, and over the oil, and over what the ground bringeth forth, and over men, and over cattle, and over all the labor of the hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then hearkened Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, unto the voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people were afraid of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then said Haggai the messenger of the Lord by the Lords message unto the people saying, I am with you, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came and did work on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>On the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of king Darius.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh month, on the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the Lord by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Do say to Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who is there yet left among you that hath seen this house in its first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in comparison with it as nothing in your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord, and be strong O Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and do; for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>In accordance with the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so will my spirit remain among you: fear nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Yet one thing more will I do, it is but little, when I will cause to quake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>And I will cause to quake all the nations, and the precious things of all the nations shall come hither: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than that of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>On the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Do ask the priests concerning the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>Lo! if one should carry holy flesh in the corner of his garment, and touch with his corner bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body shall touch any of these, will it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It will become unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so are all works of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now direct, I pray you, your heart from this day and upward, before the time that a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>Since those days were, when one came to a heap of sheaves of twenty in number, and there were but ten; when one came to the winepress for to draw off fifty measures out of the vat, and there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands: yet ye turned not back to me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Direct, I pray you, your heart from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lords temple was laid, direct your heart to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the figtree, and the pomegranate, and the olivetree, have not brought forth; but from this day will I bless you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And the word of the Lord came the second time unto Haggai on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel the governor of Judah, saying, I will cause to quake the heavens and the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, the son of Shealthiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and I will place thee as a signet; for of thee have I made choice, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
