        <verse osisID='Nah.1.2'>A God watchful and avenging is the Lord; an avenger is the Lord, and full of fury; the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and keepeth in mind the deeds of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.3'>The Lord is longsuffering, and great in power, but he will by no means clear the guilty: the Lordin the whirlwind and in the storm is his way, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.4'>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and all the rivers he drieth up: Bashan then withereth, with Carmel, and the flowers of Lebanon wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.5'>Mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away; and the earth is lifted up at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.6'>Before his indignation who can stand? and who can subsist before the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken down by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.7'>The Lord is good, a stronghold on the day of distress; and he knoweth those that trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.8'>But with an overflowing flood will he utterly destroy the place of Nineveh, and his enemies will he pursue with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.9'>What will you devise against the Lord? he is bringing about an utter destruction, the distress shall not rise up twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.10'>For they, like thorns interwoven, and as men made drunken in their drinking bout, shall be entirely consumed as dry stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.11'>There is gone forth out of thee he that devised evil against the Lord, the counsellor of infamous things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.12'>Thus hath said the Lord, Though they be complete, and ever so many, nevertheless shall they be cut down, and it shall be over with them: and if even I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.13'>For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and thy bonds will I tear asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.14'>But against thee hath the Lord decreed, that no heir of thy name shall be any more: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven and the molten image; I will prepare thy grave there; for thou art made vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.15'>
          <note>(2:1)</note> Behold, upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, Celebrate thy feasts, O Judah, fulfill thy vows; for never more shall the wicked pass again through thee, he is utterly cut off.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Nah.2.1'>
          <note>(2:2)</note> The destroyer is come up against thee to enclose thee with works of siege: look out on the way, make thy loins strong, strengthen thyself greatly with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.2'>
          <note>(2:3)</note> For the Lord bringeth back again the excellency of Jacob, as also the excellency of Israel; for the plunderers have plundered them, and have wasted branches of their vines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.3'>
          <note>(2:4)</note> The shields of his mighty men are made red, the valiant men are clothed in scarlet: with the fire of the steel the chariots glitter on the day when he prepareth himself for battle, and the spears are shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.4'>
          <note>(2:5)</note> In the streets the chariots rush madly along, they rattle through the public places: their appearance is like torches, they run along like the lightnings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.5'>
          <note>(2:6)</note> He will summon his valiant men, they shall stumble in their walk: they hasten to her walls, and the covering for defence is prepared.</verse>

          <note>(2:9)</note> And Nineveh was like a pool of water from the days that she existed: yet now they flee. "Stand, stand," shall they cry, but none shall look back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.9'>
          <note>(2:10)</note> Plunder silver, plunder gold; for without end are the treasures, there is an abundance of all precious vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.10'>
          <note>(2:11)</note> She is void, and emptied out, and wasted; and the heart melteth, and the knees totter, and trembling is in all loins, and the faces of them all are covered with blackness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.11'>
          <note>(2:12)</note> Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and what was the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, and the lions whelp walked, and none made them afraid?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.12'>
          <note>(2:13)</note> The lion tore in pieces prey enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled with prey his holes, and his dens with what he had torn.</verse>

          <note>(2:14)</note> Behold, I will be against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn into smoke thy chariots, and thy young lions shall the sword devour: and I will cut off from the earth thy preying, and no more shall be heard the voice of thy messengers.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Nah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.1'>Woe to the city of blood! it is all full of lies and robbery; never ceaseth the preying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.2'>The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and of prancing horses, and of the skipping chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.3'>Horsemen mount, and there are the flaming sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and heaps of carcasses; and without end are the corpses; they stumble on their corpses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.4'>Because of the multitude of the lewd deeds of the harlot, that is rich in gracefulness, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her lewd deeds, and families through her witchcrafts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.5'>Behold, I will be against thee, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will lay thy skirts open over thy face, and I will let nations see thy nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.6'>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and defile thee, and will render thee a dirtheap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.7'>And it shall come to pass, that all they that see thee shall flee from thee, and say, Laid waste is Nineveh: who will condole with her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.8'>Art thou better than Noamon, that was situated on the rivers, that had water round about her, the rampart of which was the sea, and the walls of which rose out of the sea?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.9'>Ethiopia the numerous, and Egypt that was without end, Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.10'>Yet also she was exiled, was carried away into captivity; also her young children were dashed in pieces at the corners of all streets: and for her honorable men they cast lots, and all her great ones were bound with chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.11'>Thou also shalt be made drunken, thou shalt be hidden from view: thou also shalt seek refuge because of the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.12'>All thy strongholds shall be like figtrees with the first ripe figs, which, if they be shaken, will fall into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.13'>Behold, thy people are become women in the midst of thee: unto thy enemies are the gates of thy land set wide open; the fire hath devoured thy bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.14'>Water for the siege draw for thyself, fortify thy strongholds: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.15'>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee up like the cankerworm: though thou make thyself many as the cankerworm; make thyself many as the locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.16'>Though thou hadst multiplied thy merchants more than the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spreadeth itself out, and flieth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.17'>Thy crowned ones are like the locusts, and thy leaders like the swarms of locusts, which camp in the hedges on a cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.18'>Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy valiant men are at rest: scattered are thy people upon the mountains, and there is none that gathereth them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.19'>There is no healing for thy breach; fatal is thy wound: all that hear the report of thee will clap their hands over thee; for over whom did not thy wickedness pass continually?</verse>
