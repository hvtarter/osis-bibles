        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>And in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, at the time the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah was accomplished, the Lord awakened the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia; and he caused a proclamation to be made throughout all his kingdom, and also by means of writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus hath said Cyrus the king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given unto me; and he hath directed me to build for him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whoever among you that is of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel, he is the God who is in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then rose up the chiefs of the divisions of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all those whose spirit God had awakened, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month drew near, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer thereon burntofferings, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they erected the altar upon its foundations; for there was fear upon them because of the people of these countries; and they offered thereon burntofferings unto the Lord, burntofferings at morning and at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they celebrated the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burntofferings by number, according to the prescribed manner, the offering of every day on its day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And afterward the continual burntoffering, and that for the new moons, and for all the feasts of the Lord that are hallowed, and that of every one who willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burntofferings unto the Lord: although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>Then did they give money unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto the Zidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedartrees from the Lebanon by sea to Joppa, according to the permission of Cyrus the king of Persia for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>And in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, did Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remainder of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem make a beginning; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then stood forward Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one man, to superintend the workmen in the house of God; also the sons of Chenadad, their sons and their brethren the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they placed the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Assaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the manner of David the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang responsively in praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord; because he is good, for unto everlasting endureth his kindness toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, while praising the Lord; because the foundation of the house of the Lord had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and chiefs of the divisions, the aged, who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, while many, shouting for joy, raised aloud their voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people could not distinguish the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard ever so far off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the exile were building the temple unto the Lord the God of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>Then came they near to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefs of the divisions, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for like you will we seek your God; and unto him do we sacrifice since the days of Essarchaddon the king of Asshur, who hath brought us up hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the of the divisions of Israel, said unto them, It is not obligatory on you and on us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together must build unto the Lord the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then did the people of the land weaken the hands of the people of Judah, and frightened them off from building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And they hired against them counsellors, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia, and even until the reign of Darius the king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Achashverosh, in the beginning of his reign they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes the king of Persia: and the writing of the letter was written in Aramic, and interpreted in Aramic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rechum the counsellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a certain letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, as followeth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then wrote Rechum the counsellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, from Din, and Apharsathach, Tarpel, Apharass, Erech, Babylon, Shushan, Dehav, and Elam,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>And the rest of the nations whom the great and honored Assnapper had brought into exile, and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is the copy of the letter which they sent unto him, even unto king Artaxerxes: Thy servants the men on this side the river, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it made known unto the king, that the Jews who removed away from thee are come up to us unto Jerusalem: they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and are completing the walls, and are joining together the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it now known unto the king, that, if this city be rebuilt, and the walls be completed, they will not give tax, tribute, and toll, and the royal revenues will suffer damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the kings dishonor, therefore have we sent and let the king know this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>That search may be made in the book of the memorable events of thy fathers, and thou wilt find in the book of the memorable events, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have practised sedition within the same from the most ancient time; for which cause this city was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We let the king know that, if this city be rebuilt, and its walls be completed, by this means thou wilt have no more any portion on this side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then sent the king a reply unto Rechum the counsellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest of those beyond the river, Peace, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which ye have sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And an order was given by me, and search was made, and it was found that this city from the most ancient time hath lifted itself up against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been practised therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>And that mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over all the countries beyond the river; and that tax, tribute, and toll was given unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Now give ye the order to stop these men, and this city shall not be built, until the order be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Take heed now that ye commit no error in this: that not any injury may grow out of this to the damage of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Thereupon so soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes letter was read before Rechum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they did go up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and stopped them by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then was stopped the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem, and it remained interrupted until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then prophesied Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, the prophets, unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, concerning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At this same time came to them Thathnai, the governor on this side of the river, and Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and thus they said unto them, "Who hath given you an order to build this house, and to complete these walls?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then said we unto them after this manner, what are the names of the men that erect this building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they did not stop them, till the matter came to Darius; and they then returned an answer by letter concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>A copy of the letter which Thathnai, the governor on this side of the river, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions, the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent unto king Darius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a report unto him, and thus was it written therein: Unto king Darius be all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which they are building with heavy stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is urged with speed, and it prospereth in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then asked we these elders, and after this manner said we unto them, Who hath given you the order to build this house, and to complete these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>Also their names did we ask of them, to let thee know them, that we might write down the names of the men that are at their head.</verse>
