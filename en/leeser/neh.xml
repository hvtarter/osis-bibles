      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Chachalyah. And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan, the capital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>That there came Chanani, one of my brethren, himself with certain men of Judah: and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great misery and in disgrace; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and her gates are burnt with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned some days, and I was fasting, and praying before the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And I said, I beseech thee, O Lord the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth the covenant and kindness for those that love him and for those that keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes be open, I entreat thee, to hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I am praying this day before thee, by day and by night, in behalf of the children of Israel thy servants, and as I confess for the sins of the children of Israel, with which we have sinned against thee: yea, I also and my fathers house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt very corruptly toward thee: and we have not kept the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou didst command Moses thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech thee, the word with which thou didst charge Moses thy servant, saying, If ye become truly unfaithful, I will indeed scatter you among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>But if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them: then though your outcasts should be at the utmost parts of heaven, from there will I gather them, and I will bring them unto the place which I have chosen to let my name dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>I beseech thee, O Lord, do let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who are desirous to fear thy name; and grant success, I pray thee, to thy servant this day, and let him find mercy in the sight of this man But I was butler by the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nissan, in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, that wine stood before him; and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. But I had never been sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>Then said the king unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing but an illness of heart. Then was I very greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said unto the king, May the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers sepulchres, lieth ruined, and her gates are consumed by fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then said the king unto me, For what then dost thou make request? Then did I pray to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said unto the king, If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant might be pleasing in thy presence, I desire that thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers sepulchres, that I may build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said unto me, while the queen was sitting beside him, When is thy journey to be undertaken? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to let me go; and I indicated to him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>And I said unto the king, If it seem good to the king, let letters be given unto me for the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till the time that I come into Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>Also a letter unto Assaph the keeper of the kings forests, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall move into. And the king gave them to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>And so came I to the governors beyond the river, and I gave them the kings letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When Sanballat the Choronite, and Tobiyah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it displeased them exceedingly, that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So came I to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>Then arose I in the night, I and some few men with me; but I had not told any man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem: nor was there any beast with me, save the beast on which I rode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out through the gate of the valley by night, even toward the direction of the dragonwell, and to the dunggate; and I was viewing the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates whereof were consumed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then passed I on to the gate of the fountain, and to the kings pool; but there was no space for the beast that was under me to pass through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up through the valley in the night, and I was viewing the wall, and I returned and entered through the gate of the valley, and so returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers knew not whither I was gone, or what I was doing: nor had I as yet told it to the Jews, and to the priests, and to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the superintendents of the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then said I unto them, Ye see the misery in which we are, how Jerusalem lieth in ruins, and its gates are burnt with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no more be for a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God, which was good upon me, as also the kings words which he had spoken unto me. And they said, We will rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Choronite, and Tobiyah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye are doing? are ye rebelling against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>And I returned them an answer, and said unto them, The God of heaven will indeed give us prosperity, and we his servants will truly rise up and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then rose up Elyashib the high priest with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheepgate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors: even as far as the tower of Meah did they sanctify it, as far as the tower of Chananel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And by his side built the men of Jericho. And by his other side built Zaccur the son of Imri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>But the fishgate did the sons of Hassenaah build: they also laid its beams, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.4'>And alongside of them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriyah, the son of Kakkoz. And alongside of them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechyah, the son of Meshezabel. And alongside of them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.5'>And alongside of them repaired the Tekoites; but their principal men put not their necks to the work of their Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.6'>Moreover the old gate repaired Yoyada the son of Passeach, and Meshullam the son of Bessodeyah: they laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.7'>And alongside of them repaired Melatyah the Gibonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, men of Gibon and of Mizpah, unto the seat of the governor on this side of the river.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.13'>The gate of the valley repaired Chanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoach: they built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the dunggate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>And the dunggate repaired Malkiyah the son of Rechah, the chief of the district of Bethhakkerem: he built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>And the gate of the fountain repaired Shallum the son of Colchozeh, the chief of the district of Mizpah: he built it and covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelach by the kings garden, and as far as the stairs that lead down from the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>Next to him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the chief of the half district of Bethzur, as far as the place opposite to the sepulchres of David, and as far as the pool that was newly made, and as far as the house of the mighty men.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>
          <note>(3:33)</note> And it came to pass, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, that it displeased him, and he became very angry, and he mocked at the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>
          <note>(3:34)</note> And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will people suffer them to build? will they sacrifice? will they complete it in one day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, seeing that they have been burnt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>
          <note>(3:35)</note> And Tobiyah the Ammonite was near him, and he said, Even what they are building, if a fox were to run up, he would readily break through their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>
          <note>(3:36)</note> Hear, O our God! how we are become a scorn; and bring their reproach back upon their own head, and give them up for prey in the land of captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>
          <note>(3:37)</note> And cover not up their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have taunted us in the presence of the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>
          <note>(3:38)</note> But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together up to the half thereof; for the people had a heart to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>
          <note>(4:1)</note> And it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiyah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were restored, and that the breaches began to be closed up, that it displeased them greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>
          <note>(4:2)</note> And they conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to do it an injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>
          <note>(4:3)</note> But we prayed unto our God, and set a watch over them day and night, because of the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>
          <note>(4:4)</note> And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of the burden is failing, and there is much rubbish; and we are not able to build on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>
          <note>(4:5)</note> And our adversaries said, "They shall not know, nor see until we come in the midst of them, and slay them, and so stop the work."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>
          <note>(4:6)</note> And it came to pass, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they said unto us ten times, "From all places whence ye may return home they intend to come over us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>
          <note>(4:7)</note> I placed therefore on the lower parts of the place on the naked rocks behind the wallthere I placed the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>
          <note>(4:8)</note> And I looked about, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: think on the Lord, the great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>
          <note>(4:9)</note> And it came to pass, that, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, God frustrated their counsel: and we returned, all of us, to the wall, every one unto his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>
          <note>(4:10)</note> And it came to pass from that day forth, that the half of my young men wrought at the work, while the other half of them were holding the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the princes stood behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>
          <note>(4:11)</note> Those that built on the wall, and those that bore burdens, with those that loaded,every one with one of his hands wrought on the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>
          <note>(4:12)</note> And the builders had every one his sword fastened around his loins while they were building; and he that blew the cornet stood alongside of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>
          <note>(4:13)</note> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extensive, and we are separated upon the wall, distant one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>
          <note>(4:14)</note> In what place then ye hear the sound of the cornet, thither must ye assemble unto us: our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>
          <note>(4:15)</note> So we labored at the work, while the half of them were holding the spears from the rising of the morningdawn till the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>
          <note>(4:16)</note> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his young man lodge within Jerusalem, so that they may be in the night a guard to us, and during the day for the labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>
          <note>(4:17)</note> And neither I, nor my brothers, nor my young men, nor the men of the guard who followed menone of us took off our clothes, no one leaving them off even for washing himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>And there were some that said, Our sons, and our daughters, and ourselves are many; and we must buy corn, that we may eat, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And others there were that said, We must pledge our fields, our vineyards, and our houses, that we may buy corn, in the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And others there were that said, We have borrowed money for the kings tax on our fields and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brethren, our children are like their children: and, lo, we must force our sons and our daughters to become servants, and some of our daughters are forced to become so, and our hand is powerless; and our fields and our vineyards belong to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And it displeased me greatly when I heard their complaint and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then did I consult with my heart, and I upbraided the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, "Ye exact usury, every one of his brother!" And I brought together a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said unto them, We have indeed ransomed our brethren the Jews, who had been sold unto the various nations, as far as our means went: and will ye yourselves even sell your brethren, so that they will be sold again unto us? And they remained silent, and found no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Then said I, The thing is not good which ye are doing: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the taunting of the nations, our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>And also I, my brothers, and my young men, have lent them money and corn: I pray you, let us relinquish this loan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Give back to them, I pray you, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye have lent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then said they, We will give all back, and of them will we require nothing: so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and made them swear, that they would do in accordance with this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also my lap did I shake out, and said, So may God shake out every man that performeth not this promise, from his house and of his toilgotten wealth, and so let him remain shaken out, and empty. And all the assembly said, Amen, and they praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the day that the king had enjoined on me to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year up to the two and thirtieth year of king Artaxerxes, full twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors that had been before me had made it heavy for the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver: yea, even their young men ruled over the people; but I myself did not act so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>And in the work of this wall also did I labor actively; and we bought not any fields; and all my young men were assembled there by the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover of the Jews and rulers, one hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from the nations that are about us, ate at my table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>And that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also birds were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance: yet with all this I required not the food of the governor; because the service lay heavily upon this people.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when it came to the hearing of Sanballat, and Tobiyah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein, although up to that time I had not yet set up the doors in the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in Kephirim, in the plain of Ono. But they were thinking of doing me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it lying, and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent unto me after this manner four times; and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then sent Sanballat unto me in like manner the fifth time his young man with an open letter in his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>Therein was written, It hath been heard among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think of rebelling; wherefore thou art building up the wall; and that thou art to be king unto them, according to these reports.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And that thou hast also set up prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem, saying, He is king in Judah: and now there may be reported to the king something like these words. Now therefore come, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent unto him, saying, "There hath been done nothing like these reports of which thou speakest; but out of thy own heart thou inventest them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all wished to make us afraid, thinking, Their hands will be withdrawn from the work, so that it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I came also into the house of Shemayah the son of Delayah the son of Mehetabel, who had shut himself up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us lock the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee: yea, in the night are they coming to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should a man like me flee? and who is there that is like me, that would go into the temple and live? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I perceived that, lo, God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy over me, because Tobiyah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>Therefore was he hired, in order that I should become afraid, and do so, and sin, and that it might serve them for an evil report, so that they might cast reproach upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Think, O my God, of Tobiyah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also of Noadyah the prophetess, and the rest of the prophets, who wished to make me afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>And so was the wall finished on the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard this, and all the nations that were about us saw it, that they sank greatly in their own eyes; and they perceived that by the aid of our God had this work been wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah despatched frequently their letters unto Tobiyah, and those of Tobiyah came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For many in Judah were sworn friends unto him; because he was the soninlaw of Shechanyah the son of Arach, and Jehochanan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Bercehyah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also his good deeds were they reporting before me, and my words they used to carry out to him: also Tobiyah sent letters to make me afraid.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>And it came to pass, when the wall was built, that I set up the doors; and then were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the other Levites to their office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>And I gave my brother Chanani, and Chananyah the commander of the fortress, charge over Jerusalem; for he was esteemed a faithful man, and one that feared God these many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said unto them, The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun be hot; and while ye stand by, let them shut the doors, and do ye bar them; and station watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one opposite to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>But the city was roomy in space and large: while the people therein were few, and the houses were not yet built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>Then did my God put it into my heart, and I assembled together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might give in their genealogy; and I found a register of the genealogy of those who were come up at the first, and I found written therein:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.12.32'>And after them walked Hoshayah, and half of the princes of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.33'>And Azaryah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.34'>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemayah, and Jeremiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.35'>And of the sons of priests with trumpets, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemayah, the son of Matthanyah, the son of Michayah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Assaph;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.36'>And his brethren, Shemayah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Chanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the expounder walked before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.37'>And over the fountaingate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even as far as the watergate, eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.38'>And the other company for thanksgiving that walked in the opposite direction to them,this one did I follow, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the ovens even as far as the broad wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.39'>And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fishgate, and the tower of Chananel, and the tower of Meah, even as far as the sheepgate; and they halted at the prisongate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.40'>So did the two companies for thanksgiving place themselves in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.41'>And the priests, Elyakim, Maasseyah, Minyamin, Michayah, Elyoenai, Zechariah, and Chananiah, with trumpets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.42'>And Maasseyah, and Shemayah, and Elazar, and Uzzi, and Jehochanan, and Malkiyah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang aloud, with Yisrachyah as their overseer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.43'>And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had caused them to rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced: so that the shout of joy of Jerusalem was heard even at a great distance off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.44'>And there were appointed at that day certain men as superintendents over the chambers for the treasuries, for the heaveofferings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions according to the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah had joy on the priests and on the Levites that stood there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.45'>And kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and as singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David, and of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.46'>For in the days of David and Assaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.47'>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeeper, what was required for every day on its day; and they sanctified things for the Levites: and the Levites sanctified the portion due for the children of Aaron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.13'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.1'>On that day there was read in the book of Moses before the ears of the people; and there was found written therein, that no Ammonite or Moabite should come into the congregation of God for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.2'>Because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water, but had hired Bilam against them, that he should curse them; although our God had changed the curse into a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.3'>And it tame to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the alien mixture from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.4'>And before this, Elyashib the priest, appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and a near of kin unto Tobiyah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.5'>Had prepared for him a large chamber, where they had laid in former times the meatofferings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was ordained for the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the heaveoffering of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.6'>But during all this I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon I went back unto the king, and after the lapse of some time I obtained by request leave of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.7'>And I came to Jerusalem, and perceived the evil that Elyashib had done for Tobiyah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>And it displeased me greatly: wherefore I cast forth all the household vessels of Tobiyah away out of the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>And I gave the order, whereupon they cleansed the chambers; and I had brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, with the meatoffering and the frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.10'>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: so that the Levites and the singers, that used to do the work, were fled every one to his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why hath the house of God become forsaken? And I gathered them together, and placed them on their posts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I appointed receivers over the treasuries, Shelemyah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and Pedayah of the Levites; and with them acted Chanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Matthanyah; for they were accounted as faithful, and it was their duty to make a distribution among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my pious deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for those that had charge of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading burdens on asses, as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day whereon they sold provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>Also the men of Tyre that dwelt therein brought fish and all kinds of wares, and sold them on the sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this which ye are doing, and profaning thereby the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers act thus, wherefore our God brought over us all this evil, and over this city? and ye bring yet more wrath over Israel by profaning the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that, when the shadows were lengthened in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I gave the order, whereupon the gates were locked, and I ordered that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my young men did I place at the gates, that there should be brought in no burden on the sabbathday.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>But the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Thereupon did I warn them, and said unto them, Why do ye lodge along the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I ordered the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep watch at the gates, to sanctify the sabbathday. Also this remember unto me, O my God, and shield me according to the abundance of thy kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also I saw certain Jews that had brought home wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>And their children spoke partly in the speech of Ashdod, and did not understand to speak in the Jewish language, but according to the language of one or the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, nor for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin by these things? and although among the many nations there was never a king like him, and beloved as he was by his God, and God had placed him as king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did the alien women mislead to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then hear it said of you, that ye do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in bringing home alien wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Joyada, the son of Elyashib the high priest, was soninlaw to Sanballat the Choronite; wherefore I chased him away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember this unto them, O my God, because of the defilements of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus cleansed I them from all aliens, and I appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites, every one in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>And for the procuring of the wood, at fixed time, and for the firstfruits. Remember this unto me, O my God, for good.</verse>
