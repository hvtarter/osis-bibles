        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the sayings of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To accept the instruction of intelligence, righteousness, and justice, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give to the simple prudence, to the youth knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>The wise will hear, and will increase his information; and the man of understanding will obtain wise counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and a sage sentence; the words of the wise, and their riddles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: wisdom and instruction fools alone despise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and cast not off the teaching of thy mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For a wreath of grace are they unto thy head, and chains for thy throat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners wish to entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they should say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us watch in concealment for the uselessly innocent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>We will swallow them up like the grave alive; and the men of integrity, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all kinds of precious wealth, we will fill our houses with booty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Thy lot must thou cast in our midst; one purse shall be for us all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not thou on the way with them; withhold thy foot from their path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run after evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For uselessly is the net spread out before the eyes of every winged bird:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>While they lie in wait for their own blood; they watch in concealment for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the paths of every one that is greedy after unlawful gain; it taketh away the life of those that own it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom crieth loudly without; in the public places she uttereth her voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>At the corner of noisy streets she calleth, at the entrances of gates; in the city she sayeth her speeches:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners take their delight in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn back to my admonition: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Whereas I called, and ye refused; I stretched out my hand, and no man was attentive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>And ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would not accept my admonition:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>Therefore I also will truly laugh at your calamity; I will deride you when your terror cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your terror cometh like the tempestcloud, and your calamity hasteneth like a whirlwind; when there come upon you distress and affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then will they call me, but I will not answer; they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of the Lord they did not choose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>That they would not attend to my counsel: that they rejected all my admonition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and from their own counsels shall they be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the defection of the simple will slay them, and the prosperity of fools will cause them to be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But he that hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from the dread of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if thou wouldst but accept my words, and treasure up my commandments with thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>To let thy ear listen unto wisdom: if thou wouldst incline thy heart to understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>For if thou wilt call after intelligence; if after understanding thou wilt lift up thy voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If thou wilt seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then wilt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of God wilt thou find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>That men may keep the paths of justice; and the way of his pious servants doth he guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then wilt thou understand righteousness, and justice, and equity: yea, every track of goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom will enter thy heart, and knowledge will be pleasant unto thy soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion will watch over thee, understanding will keep thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from the way of the bad, from the man that speaketh perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>From those who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, who are delighted in the perverseness of the bad;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Who as regardeth their paths are crooked, and froward in their tracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the adulteress, from the alien woman that useth flattering speeches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>That forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For she sinketh unto deathher house, and unto the departed lead her tracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>All that come unto her return not again, and they will not reach the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>In order that thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and observe the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright will dwell on the earth, and the perfect will be left remaining on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous shall be plucked up therefrom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let kindness and truth not forsake thee; bind them about thy throat; write them upon the table of thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the eyes of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the Lord with all thy heart: and upon thy own understanding do not rely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make level thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For good information do I give you: my teaching must ye not forsake.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>And now, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove far from her thy way, and come not nigh to the door of her house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>That thou mayest not give up unto others thy vigor, and thy years unto the cruel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>That strangers may not satisfy themselves with thy strength, and with thy exertions, in the house of an alien:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>While thou moanest at thy end, when thy flesh and thy body are coming to their end,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>A heart that contriveth plans of injustice, feet that hasten to run after evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>A false witness that eagerly uttereth lies, and him that scattereth abroad discord among brethren.</verse>
