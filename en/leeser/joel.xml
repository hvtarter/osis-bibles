        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Did ever such a thing as this come to pass in your days, or ever in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>Tell ye of it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to another generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>What the caterpillar left hath the locust eaten; and what the locust left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm left hath the cricket eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>Wake up, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet new wine, that it is taken away from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>For a nation is come up over my land, strong, and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it hath the cuttingteeth of the lioness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>It hath laid my vine waste, and barked my figtree: it hath peeled it clean bare, and cast it down; made white are its light branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the betrothed of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>Cut off are the meatoffering and the drinkoffering from the house of the Lord: now mourn the priests, the ministers of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>Wasted is the field, the land mourneth; for wasted is the corn: dried up is the new wine, withered is the oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen; wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because lost is the harvest of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>The vine is made ashamed, and the figtree is withered; the pomegranatetree, the palmtree also, and the appletree, even all the trees of the field, are dried up; because joy hath ceased from the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar: come, remain all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God; for there are withholden from the house of your God the meatoffering and the drinkoffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>Sanctify ye a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of the Lord your God, and cry aloud unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and like destruction from the Almighty will it come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>Is not before our eyes the food cut off, from the house of our God joy and gladness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>The grains of seed are rotten under their clods, laid desolate are the garners, pulled down are the barns; for the corn is dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>How do the beasts groan! how do the herds of cattle roam about; because there is no pasture for them: yea, the flocks of sheep are made to perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>To thee O Lord, will I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath singed all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>Also the beasts of the field cry unto thee panting; for the brooks of waters are dried up, and a fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Blow ye the cornet in Zion, and sound an alarm on my holy mount; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>It is a day of darkness and of gloom, a day of clouds and of tempestuous obscurity, like the morningdawn spread out upon the mountains: a people numerous and strong, the like of which hath never been and after it there will be none any more, even to the years of all coming generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>Before it devoureth a fire; and behind it singeth a flame: like the garden of Eden was the land before it came, and after it is a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing escapeth from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>Like the appearance of horses is its appearance; and like horsemen, so do they run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains do they leap; they are like the noise of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, as a strong people arrayed for a battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>At its presence the people are much pained: all the faces are covered with blackness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>Like mighty men do they run; like men of war they climb up a wall; and they march every one on his own ways, and they turn not aside on their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>And they do not press one another; every one on his beaten track do they go forward: and they pass through between warlike weapons, and change not their purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>Into the city they hasten forward; on the wall they run; into the houses they climb up; through the windows they make their entrance like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>Before them trembleth the earth; the heavens quake; the sun and the moon are obscured, and the stars withdraw their brightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>And the Lord uttereth his voice before his army; for very numerous is his camp; for strong is he that executeth his word; for great is the day of the Lord and very terrible; and who is able to endure it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>But even now also, saith the Lord, return ye fully to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>And rend your heart, and not your garments, and return unto the Lord your God; for gracious and merciful is he, long suffering, and of great kindness, and he bethinketh himself of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>He that is conscious of guilt, let him return and repent: when the plague may leave behind it a blessing; even a meatoffering and a drinkoffering unto the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>Blow the cornet in Zion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth out of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>Between the porch and the altar let the priests weep, the ministers of the Lord, and let them say, Spare, O Lord, thy people, and give not up thy heritage to reproach, for nations to make a byword of them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>And the Lord was zealous for his land, and he had pity for his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>And the Lord answered and said unto his people, "Behold, I will send you the corn, and the young wine, and the oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will not give you up any more to be a reproach among the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>And the host of the north will I remove far away from you, and I will drive it off into a land barren and desolate, with its advance toward the eastern sea, and its rereward toward the western sea; and its stench shall ascend, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice; for the Lord hath done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness have become green; for the tree beareth its fruit, the figtree and the vine yield their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>And ye children of Zion, be glad, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for he hath given you the first rain in beneficence, and he hath caused to come down for you the rain, the first rain, and the latter rain in the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>And the threshingfloors are full of corn, and the vats overflow with young wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>And I will repay to you the years in which the locust hath eaten all, with the cankerworm, and the cricket, and the caterpillar, my great army, which I had sent against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall not be made ashamed unto eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else; and my people shall not be made ashamed unto eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.28'>
          <note>(3:1)</note> And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit over all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams: your young men shall see visions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'>
          <note>(3:2)</note> And also over the menservants and over the maidservants in those days will I pour out my spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'>
          <note>(3:3)</note> And I will display wonderful tokens in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'>
          <note>(3:4)</note> The sun shall be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and the terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'>
          <note>(3:5)</note> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall escape; for on mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and among the remnant whom the Lord calleth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'>
          <note>(4:3)</note> And for my people did they cast lots; and gave a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and drank it.</verse>

          <note>(4:4)</note> And also ye, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all ye districts of Philistia? is this the recompense which ye repay me? or do ye only commence to render me evil? swiftly and speedily will I bring back your recompense upon your own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>
          <note>(4:5)</note> Because my silver and my gold have ye taken, and the handsomest of my precious things have ye carried into your temples;</verse>

          <note>(4:8)</note> And I will deliver your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off; for the Lord hath spoken it.</verse>

          <note>(4:14)</note> Multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision; for near is the day of the Lord in the valley of decision.</verse>
