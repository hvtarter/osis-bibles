          <note>(75:9)</note> For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foameth, it is full of mixture: and he poureth out of the same; but its lees they drain, they drinkall the wicked of the earth.</verse>

          <note>(77:8)</note> Will the Lord cast me off for ever? and will he never more give his favor again?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.78'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.1'>A Maskil of Assaph. Give ear, O my people, to my instruction: incline thy ear to the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.2'>I will open with a parable my mouth: I will utter riddles out of ancient times;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.3'>Which we have heard and know, and which our fathers have related unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.4'>We will not conceal them from their children, relating to the latest generation the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful deeds which he hath done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.5'>Yea, he established a testimony in Jacob, and instituted a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.6'>In order that the latest generation might know them, even the children that are to be born; that they may arise and relate them to their children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.7'>That they may place in God their hope, and not forget the doings of God, but observe his commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.8'>And that they may not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that had not directed their heart firmly, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.9'>The children of Ephraim, like wellarmed archers, that turn round on the day of battle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.10'>Kept not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.11'>And they forgot his deeds, as also his wonders, which he had permitted them to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.12'>In the presence of their fathers did he do wonders, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.13'>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters stand upright as a wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.14'>And he led them with the cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.15'>He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the mighty deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.16'>And he brought forth running streams out of the rock, and caused water to run down like rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.17'>But they repeated to sin yet more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.18'>And they tempted God in their heart, by asking food for their desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.19'>Yea, they spoke against God: they said, Will God be able to set in order a table in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.20'>Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed: shall he also be able to give bread? or can he provide flesh for his people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.21'>Therefore, when the Lord heard this, he became wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also ascended against Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.22'>Because they had not believed in God, and had not trusted in his salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.23'>Then he ordained the skies from above, and the doors of heaven he opened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.24'>And he let rain down upon them manna to eat, and the corn of heaven gave he unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.25'>Angels bread did man eat: he sent them provision to satisfaction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.26'>He caused an east wind to pass along the heavens; and he led forth by his strength the south wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.27'>And he let rain upon them flesh as plentiful as the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.28'>And he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.29'>And they ate, and were greatly satisfied, and what they longed for he brought unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.30'>They were not estranged from their longing, yet was their food in their mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.31'>When the wrath of God ascended against them, and he slew some of the fattest of them, and the young men of Israel did he strike down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.32'>With all this they sinned again, and believed not in his wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.33'>Therefore he caused their days to come to an end in nought, and their years in dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.34'>When he slew them, then did they seek him, and they returned and inquired earnestly after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.35'>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the most high God their redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.36'>Nevertheless they prayed insincerely to him with their mouth, and with their tongue they lied unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.37'>For their heart was not firm with him, and they were not faithful in his covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.38'>But he, being merciful, forgave the iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not awaken all his fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.39'>And he remembered that they are but flesh, a spirit that passeth away, and returneth not again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.40'>How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, grieve him in the desert!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.41'>Yea, they once more tempted God, and set limits to the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.42'>They remembered not his hand, the day when he ransomed them from the adversary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.43'>When he displayed in Egypt his signs, and his wonderful tokens in the fields of Zoan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.44'>And he changed their rivers into blood; and their running streams, that they could not drink of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.45'>He sent out among them various wild beasts, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.46'>And he gave unto the cricket their products, and their labor unto the locust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.47'>He slew with hail their vines, and their sycamoretrees with icebolts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.48'>And he surrendered to the hail their cattle, and their herds to the lightnings flashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.49'>He let loose against them the fierceness of his anger, wrath and indignation, and distress, a host of angels of misfortune.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.50'>He leveled a path for his anger; he withheld not from death their soul, and their life he surrendered to the pestilence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.51'>And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the first of their strength in the tents of Ham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.52'>But he caused his own people to depart like flocks, and guided them like a drove in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.53'>And he led them in safety, so that they felt no dread; but the sea covered over their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.54'>And he brought them to his holy territory, even to this mount, which his right hand had acquired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.55'>And he drove out from before them nations, and divided them by the measuringline as an inheritance, and he caused to dwell in their tents the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.56'>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high God, and his testimonies they kept not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.57'>But swerved aside, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they turned about like a deceitful bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.58'>And they provoked him to anger with their highplaces, and with their graven images they moved him to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.59'>God heard this, and he became wroth, and felt greatly disgusted with Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.60'>And he cast off the dwelling at Shiloh, the tabernacle where he had dwelt among men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>And he gave up his strength unto captivity, and his glory into the adversarys hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>And he surrendered his people unto the sword; and with his inheritance was he wroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>His young men the fire devoured; and his virgins were not demanded in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.64'>His priests fell by the sword; and his widows did not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Then awoke the Lord as one that sleepeth, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>And he smote his enemies backward: a perpetual disgrace on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>Yet was he disgusted with the tent of Joseph, and of the tribe of Ephraim he made not choice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And he built like high mountains his sanctuary, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>And he made choice of David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.71'>From following the ewes with young he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.72'>And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and by the skilfulness of his hands did he lead them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.79'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.79.1'>A psalm of Assaph. O God! nations have entered into thy heritage; they have profaned thy holy temple; they have rendered Jerusalem heaps of ruins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.79.2'>They have given the dead bodies of thy servants as food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy pious ones unto the beasts of the earth.</verse>
