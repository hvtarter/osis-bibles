      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechyah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The Lord hath been greatly angry with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>And now say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Return ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will return unto you: so hath said the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be ye not like your fathers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Do return from your evil ways, and your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor listen unto me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers,where are they! and the prophets, could they live for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, behold, they did overtake your fathers: and then they returned and said, Just as the Lord of hosts had purposed to do unto us, in accordance with our ways, and in accordance with our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechyahu, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw this night, and behold there was a man riding upon a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtletrees that were in the deep valley; and behind him were red, pale, and white horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>And I said, What are these, O my lord? Then said unto me the angel that spoke with me, I will show thee what these are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the myrtletrees answered and said, These are those whom the Lord hath sent to traverse the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtletrees, and said, We have traversed the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited quietly, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then commenced the angel of the Lord, and said, O Lord of hosts, how long yet wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast been indignant these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the Lord answered the angel that spoke with me with good words and comforting words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>And the angel that spoke with me said unto me, Proclaim thou, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And with a great anger will I be angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little angry with Zion, and they helped forward the mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus hath said the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem in mercy: my house shall be rebuilt in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and the measuringline shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Proclaim yet farther, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, My cities shall again overflow with prosperity: and the Lord will again comfort Zion, and make choice again of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>
          <note>(2:1)</note> And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there were four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>
          <note>(2:2)</note> And I said unto the angel who spoke with me, What are these? And he said unto me, These are the horns that have dispersed Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>
          <note>(2:3)</note> And the Lord showed me four carpenters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>
          <note>(2:4)</note> Then said I, What are these coming to do? And he said as followeth, These are the horns that have dispersed Judah, to the extent that no man could lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast off the horns of the nations, that have been lifting up their horn over the land of Judah to disperse it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>
          <note>(2:5)</note> And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measurecord in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>
          <note>(2:6)</note> Then said I, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her breadth, and what is her length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>
          <note>(2:7)</note> And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>
          <note>(2:8)</note> And he said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Without walls shall Jerusalem be inhabited because of the multitude of men and cattle in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>
          <note>(2:9)</note> But II will be unto her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and for glory will I be in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>
          <note>(2:10)</note> Up! up! and flee away from the land of the north saith the Lord; for as the four winds of the heaven have I spread you abroad, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>
          <note>(2:11)</note> Up, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>
          <note>(2:12)</note> For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, For the sake of your glory hath he sent me unto the nations that have despoiled you; for whoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>
          <note>(2:13)</note> For, behold, I will swing my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall acknowledge that the Lord of hosts hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>
          <note>(2:14)</note> Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I am coming, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>
          <note>(2:15)</note> And many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day, and they shall be unto me for a people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>
          <note>(2:16)</note> And the Lord will take Judah as his inheritance upon the holy land; and he will again make choice of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>
          <note>(2:17)</note> Be silent, all flesh! before the Lord; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the accuser standing at his right hand to accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the Lord said unto the accuser, The Lord rebuke thee, O Accuser; yea, the Lord rebuke thee that hath chosen Jerusalem: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he commenced and said unto those that stood before him, saying; Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said unto him, Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from off thee, and I clothe thee with festive garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them place a clean mitre upon his head. So they placed the clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; rind the angel of the Lord stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of the Lord forewarned Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then shalt thou also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Do but hear, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee; for distinguished men are they; for, behold, I will bring my servant Zemach the Sprout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold here is the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave thereon its inscription, saith the Lord of hosts, And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man to his neighbor under the vine and under the figtree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that spoke with me came back again, and waked me up, as a man that is wakened up out of his sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And he said unto me, What art thou seeing? And I said, I have looked, and behold, there is a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon its top, and its seven lamps are thereupon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon its top:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>And two olivetrees are by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>And I commenced and said unto the angel that spoke with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel that spoke with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then answered he and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou wilt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings of, Grace, grace unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall complete it: and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For whoever even despised the day of its small beginning: yet will they rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which hold a survey through all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>And I began, and said unto him, What are these two olivetrees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon its left?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I began a second time, and said unto him, What are these two olivebranches, which are close by the two golden pipes which empty out of themselves the goldcolored oil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he said to me as followeth, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then said he, These are the two sons of the clear oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>And I again lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold there was a flying rollbook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll, its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of all the earth; for every one that stealeth as it is on this side shall be in an equal degree entirely destroyed, as also every one that sweareth falsely as it is on that side shall be likewise entirely destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then went forth the angel that spoke with me, and said unto me, Do but lift up thy eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance through all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And, behold, there was lifted up a heavy cover of lead: and there was a certain woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This is the wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weighty lead cover upon the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then did I lift up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, having the wind in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then said I to the angel that spoke with me, Whither are these bearing away the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar: and when this is erected, then will the other be set there upon its own base.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I again lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there came out four chariots from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>And in the third chariot, white horses; and in the fourth chariot, grizzled, ashcolored horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>And I began and said unto the angel that spoke with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth after having stood before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>The chariot on which are black horsesthese go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the redcolored were gone forth, and sought to traverse the earth: and he said, Go, traverse the earth. So they traversed the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then cried he loudly unto me, and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, these that are going toward the north country, have quieted the indignation of my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take from the exiles, from Cheldai, from Tobiyahu, and from Yedayah, and thou shalt come on the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephanyah, whither they have arrived from Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>Take also silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And thou shalt say unto him as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold a man, Sprout is his name; since out of his own place shall he sprout up, even he shall build the temple of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Yea, he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and a priest shall be upon his own throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be for Chelem, and for Tobiyah, and for Yedayah, and for Chen the son of Zephanyah, as a memorial in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And distant ones shall come and build on the temple of the Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius that the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>When they had sent unto Bethel Sherezer and Regemmelech, and his men, to make entreaty before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>And to say unto the priests who were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Shall I weep in the fifth month with abstinence, as I have done already these many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Say unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, as followeth, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, already these seventy years, did ye in anywise fast for me, yea, for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And if ye do eat, and if ye do drink, are ye not yourselves those that eat, and yourselves those that drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Are not these the words which the Lord hath proclaimed by means of the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, with her cities round about her, when men inhabited the south, and the lowlands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And defraud not the widow, or the fatherless, the stranger, or the poor; and imagine not evil in your heart one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to listen, and turned away rebelliously the shoulder, and stopped their ears, so as not to hear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>And their heart they rendered as an adamant, so as not to hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent through his spirit, by means of the former prophets: wherefore came a great anger from the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>And it is come to pass, that as he proclaimed, and they would not hear: so had they to call, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>And I resolved to scatter them with a stormwind among all the nations that they had not known; and the land was left desolate after them, without any one to pass through it forward or backward; and the pleasant land have they changed into a desert.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy, and with great fury am I jealous for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus hath said the Lord, I return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called, The city of truth; and the mount of the Lord of hosts, The holy mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Again shall there sit old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, and every one with his staff in his hand because of their multitude of years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in her streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, If it should be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the country of the setting of the sun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them back, that they may dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto them for a God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words out of the mouth of the prophets, who spoke on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, when the temple was to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before those days there was no reward for man, nor any reward for beast; and for him that went out or came in there was no peace, because of the oppressor: and I let loose all men, every one against his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I am no more as in the former days unto the residue of this people, saith the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For the seed shall be undisturbed; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give her production, and the heavens shall give their dew: and I will bestow on the remnant of this people all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass, that, in the same degree as ye have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel, so will I save you and ye shall be a blessing: fear not; let your hands be strong.</verse>
