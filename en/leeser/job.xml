      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, Job was his name; And this man was perfect and upright, and fearing God, and eschewing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred sheasses, and he had a very great store of servants: so that this man was greater than all the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons used to go and prepare a feast in the house of every one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it happened, when the days of the feast were gone round, that Job sent and sanctified them, and he then rose up early in the morning, and offered burntofferings according to the number of all of them; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and have renounced God in their heart. In this manner used Job to do all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it happened on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job; for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Is it for nought that Job feareth God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Behold, thou hast indeed placed a fence about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side: the work of his hands hast thou blessed, and his cattle are far spread out in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But stretch only forth thy hand and touch all that he hath, and see whether he will not renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, all that is his be in thy power; only against himself shalt thou not stretch forth thy hand. The Accuser went thereupon away from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it happened on a certain day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>That a messenger came unto Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the sheasses were feeding beside them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>When the Sabeans made an incursion, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, A fire of God fell from heaven, and burnt among the sheep and the young men, and consumed them; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, The Chaldeans posted themselves in three divisions, and made an inroad against the camels, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While this one was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>When, behold, a violent wind came from the direction of the wilderness, and struck against the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then arose Job, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And he said, Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; may the name of the Lord be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>With all this did Job not sin, and attributed no injustice to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And it happened again on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them to present himself before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou now? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job: for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil? and he is still holding fast to his integrity, and thou hast incited me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Skin for skin: yea, all that a man hath will he give in behalf of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But stretch only forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and see whether he will not renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, he is in thy hand: only take care of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>Thereupon went the Accuser forth from the presence of the Lord, and he smote Job with a sore inflammation, from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And Job took himself a potsherd to scrape himself there with, while he was sitting down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him, Art thou still holding fast to thy integrity? renounce God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the worthless women would speak. What? should we accept the good alone, from God, and the evil we should not accept? With all this did Job not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>When now the three friends of Job had heard of all this evil that was come over him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Themanite, and Bildad the Shuchite, and Zophar the Naamthite; and they met together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and they recognised him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and strewed dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>They likewise sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his pain was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this time Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job commenced, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Oh that the day whereon I was born might perish, and the night when it was said, There hath been a male child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>May that day be covered with darkness; may not God from above inquire for it, and may no light beam upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Oh that darkness and the shadow of death might defile it; may a cloud rest upon it; may the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>Yon nightlet darkness seize upon it; let it not be united to the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the periods lighted by the moon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, may that night be solitary, let no song of joy occur thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let those denounce it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; let it hope for light, and there be none; and let it not behold the eyelids of the morningdawn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because God closed not against me the doors of the womb, and thus concealed trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die the moment I issued from the womb, and why was I not born merely to perish at once?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Wherefore were knees ready to receive me? and for what purpose were breasts there that I might suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I be lying still and be quiet; I should sleep: then would I be at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build up ruined places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes possessing gold, who fill their houses with silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as an untimely birth, hidden from view I should not exist; as infants that never have seen the light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There where the wicked cease from troubling; and where the exhausted weary are at rest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>Where the prisoners repose together, and they hear no more the taskmasters voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small with the great is there, and the servant free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore giveth He now light to the laborladen, and life unto the bitter in soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who wait for death, which cometh not; and who dig for it sooner than for hidden treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who would rejoice even to exulting, who would be glad could they but find a grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, and around whom God hath placed a fence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For before my food cometh my groaning, and like the water are poured forth my loud complaints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>Because what I greatly dreaded is come upon me, and what I apprehended is come unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I have had no safety, and no quiet, and no rest; and now harrowing trouble is come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If we essay to address a word to thee, wilt thou be wearied? yet who is able to refrain from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast ere this corrected many, and weak hands thou wast wont to strengthen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Him that stumbled thy words used to uphold, and to sinking knees thou gavest vigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>Yet now, when it cometh to thee, thou art wearied: it toucheth even thee, and thou art terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not then thy fear of God still thy confidence, thy hope equal to the integrity of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous destroyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, that those who plough wrongdoing, and sow trouble, have to reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>Before the breathing of God they perish, and before the breath of his nostrils they come to their end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness have to scatter themselves abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>But to me a word came by stealth, and my ear took in a scarcely perceptible whisper thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In intense thoughts out of visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Dread came over me, with trembling, and it caused all my bones to shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then flitted a spirit past before my face; the hair of my body stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not recognize its form; a figure was before my eyes, a slight whisper, then a louder voice I heard, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Can a mortal be more righteous than God? or can a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, in his servants he putteth no trust, and his angels he chargeth with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much less in those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed till they come to be eaten by the moth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>From morning to evening are they broken to pieces: without laying it to heart they perish for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Behold, their excellency which is in them is torn away: they die, and this without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Do but call: is there one that will answer thee? and to whom of the saints wilt thou turn thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation will prove death to a foolish man, and jealousy will slay the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have myself seen the foolish taking root; but I suddenly held his habitation as accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from help, and men crush them in the gate, with no one to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>He it is whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber snatcheth eagerly after their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For wrong doth not come forth out of the dust, neither doth trouble grow up out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But man is born unto trouble, as young birds take up their flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>I, however, would have besought God, and unto God would I have committed my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doth great things which are unsearchable, marvelous things till they are without number;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain upon the surface of the earth, and sendeth out waters over the face of the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>To set up the lowly on high, that those who mourn may rise high to happiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>But who frustrateth the plans of the crafty, so that their hands cannot execute their welldevised counsel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>Who catcheth the wise in their own craftiness; and the advise of the perverse is hastened on headlong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>By day they meet with darkness, and as though it were night they grope about in the noon of day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But who saveth from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty, the needy one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>And so cometh to the indigent hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God admonisheth: despise then not the correction of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he it is that woundeth, and bindeth up: he smiteth, and his hands do heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>In six distresses will he deliver thee; and in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he redeemeth thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Against the scourge of the tongue shall thou he hidden; and thou needest not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine canst thou laugh; and thou needest not have any fear of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For with the stones of the field shalt thou have thy covenant; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent; and thou wilt look over thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thy offspring as the herbage of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thon wilt go in a ripe age unto the grave, as a shock of corn is carried home in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is: hear it, and do thou note it well for thyself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then answered Job, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my vexation could be truly weighed, and my calamity; oh that men might lift it up in the balances at once!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it is already heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore are my words confused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh it: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray over the grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Is ever tasteless food eaten without salt? or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuseth to touch them: they are unto me like disgusting food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that some one would grant the accomplishment of my request; and that God would grant me the fulfillment of my hope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Yea, that it would please God that he might crush me: that he would let loose his hand, and make an end of me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then would this be still my comfort; yea, I would rejoice in my pain while be would not spare: that I have not gainsaid the commands of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait? and what my end, that I should yet longer retain my patience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is the strength of stones my strength? or is my flesh brazen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Truly, am I not without my help in me? and is not wise counsel driven far away from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>As though I were one who refuseth kindness to his friend, and forsaketh the fear of the Almighty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers are treacherous as a brook, like flowing brooks they pass along;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are made turbid by reason of the ice, wherein the snow hideth itself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>At the time when they feel the warmth, they vanish; when it is hot, they are quenched out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their course wind themselves along; they go in the wilderness and are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Thema look hither, the travelling companies Sheba hope for them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>But they stand ashamed because they had trusted; they come thither and are made to blush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For truly now ye are like such a one: ye see my terrible state and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Have I then ever said, Give me something, and out of your property offer a bribe in my behalf?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>And deliver me from the hand of the adversary? and redeem from the hand of tyrants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will indeed remain silent; and wherein I erred give me to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How pleasant are straightforward words! but what doth arguing prove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye think to reprove words, and to regard as wind the speeches of one that is despairing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye would cast any thing upon the fatherless, and ye would dig a pit against your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>But now, if it please you, turn yourselves toward me, and say whether I would lie before your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Reflect again, I pray you, there will be no wrong: yea, reflect once more, my righteousness will be found therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there any wrong on my tongue? or should my palate not understand if I spoke what is iniquitous?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not a limited time of service to a mortal upon the earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired laborer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a servant eagerly longeth for the shadow, and as a hired laborer hopeth for his reward:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>So was I compelled to possess months of vanity, and nights of trouble were counted out unto me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.40.5'>Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will not repeat it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.6'>Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the stormwind, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.7'>Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: I will ask thee, and do thou inform me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.8'>Wilt thou indeed annul my decree? wilt thou condemn me, in order that thou mayest appear righteous?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.9'>But if thou hast an arm like God, or if thou canst thunder loudly like him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.10'>Then do deck thyself with excellence and greatness, and clothe thyself in majesty and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.11'>Scatter abroad the ragings of thy wrath, and look on every proud one, and humble him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.40.13'>Hide them in the dust altogether: bind up their faces in concealment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.14'>Then will I also myself praise thee, when thy own right hand hath helped thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.15'>Only behold Behemoth, which I made near thee: grass he eateth like the ox.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.16'>Only see, how great is his strength in his loins, and his force, in the muscles of his belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.17'>He stretcheth out his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his loins are closely wrapped together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.18'>His bones are like pipes of brass: his frame is like bars of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.19'>He is the first in rank of the works of God: he that made him can alone bring his sword near unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.20'>But truly the mountains bear for him his food, and all the beasts of the field play there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.21'>Under shady trees he lieth down, in the covert of the reeds, and swamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.22'>Shady trees cover him as his shadow: willows of the brook encompass him about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.23'>Behold, a river sweepeth violently along, but he hasteneth not away: he remaineth quiet, though a Jordan rusheth up to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.24'>Can one catch him before his eyes? pierce his nose by means of snares?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then answered Job unto the Lord, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I acknowledge that thou art able to do every thing, and that no deep plan of thine can be restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is he that dareth to conceal thy counsel without knowledge? Truly I have spoken of what I understood not, of things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Oh do but hear me, and I will indeed speak: I will ask of thee, and do thou inform me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had only heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye hath seen thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I reject what I have said, and repent; because I am dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it came to pass, after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Themanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>And now take unto yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burntoffering in your behalf; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him alone will I receive favorably, so as not to deal with you after your folly; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>Then went Eliphaz the Themanite and Bildad the Shuchite and Zophar the Naamathite, and did in accordance with what the Lord had spoken to them: and the Lord received Job in favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the Lord brought back the captivity of Job, when he prayed in behalf of his friends; and the Lord increased all that Job had had twofold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>And then came unto him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they condoled with him, and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him; and they gave him, every one, a kessitah, and every one an earring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand sheasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And there were not found such handsome women as the daughters of Job in all the land; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years: and he saw his sons, and his sons sons, even four generations.</verse>
