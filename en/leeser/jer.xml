      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Chilkiyahu, one of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>And who continued prophet in the days of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah the king of Judah, until the carrying away into exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before yet I had formed thee in thy mothers body I knew thee; and before thou wast yet come forth out of the womb I sanctified thee: a prophet unto the nations did I ordain thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>And I said, Ah, Lord Eternal! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am but a lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>And the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am but a lad; but to whomsoever I may send thee shalt thou go, and whatsoever I may command thee shalt thou speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>And the Lord stretched forth his hand, and touched me therewith on my mouth; and the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down: to build up, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, A staff of all almondtree do I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>And the Lord said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watching over my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A seething pot do I see; and the front thereof is turned from the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>And the Lord said unto me, Out of the north shall the evil break forth over all the inhabitants of the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, lo, I will call unto all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all its walls round about, and upon those of all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will call them to account touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other gods, and have bowed down unto the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>But do thou gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I may command thee; be not discouraged because of them, lest I humble thee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>But I, behold, I have made of thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls over the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And although they fight against thee, they shall not prevail against thee; for with thee am I saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and call out before the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, I remember unto thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals, thy going after me in the wilderness, through a land that is not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>A holy thing is Israel unto the Lord, the first of his fruits: all that devour him shall incur guilt; evil shall come over them, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus hath said the Lord, What fault did your fathers find in me, that they went away far from me, and walked after vanity, and became vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>That they said not, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of wildness, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land through which no one had passed, and where no man had dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into the land of fruitful fields, to eat its fruit and its goodly products; but ye came and ye made unclean my land, and my heritage ye rendered an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied in the name of Baal, and after things that cannot profit did they walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore will I contend yet farther with you, saith the Lord, and with your childrens children will I contend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over to the isles of the Chittites, and see; and unto Kedar send, and consider well and see if any thing like this hath happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Hath a nation exchanged its gods, which are yet no gods? and still my people hath exchanged its glory for that which can not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and let your hair stand at an end, be ye greatly terrified, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For two evils have my people committed: me have they forsaken, the source of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a servant? or one born to servitude in the house? why hath he been given up to plunder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>That over him young lions roared, let their voice resound, and changed his land into a waste, that his cities are burnt, left without an inhabitant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Even the children of Noph and Thachpanches have crushed the crown of thy head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, through thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while he was leading thee on the right way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what hast thou to do on the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shichor? and what hast thou to do on the way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the river?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Thy own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall correct thee; and thou shalt know and see that evil and bitter was thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while the dread of me was not upon thee, saith the Lord Eternal of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>Because from yore did I break thy yoke, did I burst asunder thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress: nevertheless upon every high hill and under every green tree thou makest thy bed, as harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted thee as a branch of a noble vine, wholly of the proper seed; but how art thou changed unto me into a degenerate plant of an ignoble vine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though thou wash thyself with natron, and take for thyself much soap: yet would the stain of thy iniquity remain before me, saith the Lord Eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How canst thou say, I am not become unclean, after the Bealim have I not gone? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: like a swift dromedary bound fast to her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>Like a wild ass used to the wilderness, that at her pleasure snuffeth up the wind; her lustwho can turn this away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month will they find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>"Prevent thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from being thirsty;" but thou saidst, It is useless; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so have the house of Israel been made ashamed, they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>Who say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast brought us forth; for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their misfortune will they say, Arise, and save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are then thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy misfortune; for equal to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Wherefore will ye contend with me? all of you have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>To no purpose have I smitten your children; correction they accepted not: your sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O present generation, regard ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of deep darkness? wherefore say my people, We wander about; we cannot come any more unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her decorations? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why ornamentest thou thy way to seek for love? truly even the worst hast thou used thyself as thy ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also on thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent needy ones: not while breaking in thy house didst thou find them; but for all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet thou sayest, Yea, I am innocent, surely his anger is already turned away from me. Behold, I will hold judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why makest thou thyself so very low to change thy way? also because of Egypt shalt thou be made ashamed, as thou wast put to shame because of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Also from this one shalt thou go forth, with thy hands clasped over thy head; for the Lord hath rejected those on whom thou trustest and thou shalt not prosper with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>One could say, Behold, if a man send away his wife, and she go from him, and become another mans, can he return unto her again? would not that land be greatly polluted? and thou hast played the harlot with many companions, and wilt yet return to me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up thy eyes unto the mountaintops, and see where thou hast not been lain with. On public roads hast thou sat for them, as the Arab in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy incests and with thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>And though the early showers were withholden, and the latter rain came not: yet hadst thou a forehead of an incestuous wife, thou refusedst to feel shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Wilt thou not from this time call out unto mem My father, the guide of my youth art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he bear grudge for ever? will he keep it to eternity? Behold, thou hast spoken this, and yet hast done the things that are evil as much as thou wast able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>And the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I thought that after she had done all these things, she would return unto me. But she returned not. And this saw her treacherous sister Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, that, although because backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had sent her away, and given her bill of divorce unto her, still treacherous Judah her sister feared not, but went and played herself the harlot also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through her giddy incest, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stone and with wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet with all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with all her heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the Lord said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself through the treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord: I will not cause my anger to fall upon you; for I am full of kindness, saith the Lord, I will not hear grudge for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge thy iniquity, that against the Lord thy God thou hast rebelled, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and that unto my voice ye have not hearkened, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am become your husband; and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and bring you to Zion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and intelligence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when ye multiply and increase in the land, in those days, saith the Lord, that men shall not say any more, "The ark of the covenant of the Lord;" nor shall it come any more to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they mention it; nor shall any thing be done any more with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time shall they call Jerusalem, The throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem: and they shall not walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days shall the house of Judah walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north unto the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I had thought, How shall I establish thee among the other sons of man, and give thee a desirable land, a heritage of glory of the hosts of nations? and I thought, My father thou wouldst call me, and that from me thou wouldst not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>But truly as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice is now heard upon the mountaintops, the supplicatory weeping of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. "Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly deceptive was what we hoped for from the hills, and the multitude on the mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>And shame hath devoured the acquisition of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us; for against the Lord our God have we sinned, we and our fathers, from our youth even until this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, unto me must thou return; and if thou wilt put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not wander about any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And if thou wilt swear, As the Lord liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness: then shall nations bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glorify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus hath said the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Plough up your fallow ground, that ye may not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and remove the obduracy of your heart, O ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Tell ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the cornet in the land: call out, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the standard toward Zion; save yourselves by flight, stay not; for evil do I bring from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of nations hath commenced his march, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, left without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird yourselves with sackcloths, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes shall fail; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then said I, Ah, Lord Eternal! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time shall be announced to this people and to Jerusalem a dry wind from the mountainpeaks in the wilderness, coming on the road to the daughter of my people; not to winnow, nor to cleanse the corn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A strong wind from these places shall come unto me: now also will I myself pronounce judgment against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, like clouds shall he come up, and like a whirlwind shall be his chariots: swifter than eagles are his horses. "Woe unto us! for we are wasted."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Wash from wrong doing thy heart, O Jerusalem, in order that thou mayest be saved. How long wilt thou let lodge within thee the thoughts of thy wickedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth unhappiness from the mountain of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Make ye mention of it to the nations; behold, let it be heard against Jerusalem, that beleaguerers come from a faroff country, and send forth their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because against me hath she been rebellious, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee: this is thy wickedness, which is so bitter, which so reacheth unto thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels, my bowels! I am shaken, at the very chambers of my heart; my heart beateth tumultuously in me; I cannot remain silent; because the sound of the cornet hast thou heard, O my soul, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Ruin upon ruin is called out; for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents wasted, and in a moment, my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, hear the sound of the cornet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>"Because my people is foolish, me have they not known; sottish children are they, and they have not any understanding: wise are they to do evil, but how to do good they do not know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I look at the earth, and, lo, it is without form and void; and toward the heavens, and their light is gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I look at the mountains, and, lo, they tremble, and all the hills are moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I look, and, lo, there is no man, and all the birds of the heavens are fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I look, and, lo, the fruitful country is a wilderness, and all its cities are laid waste at the presence of the Lord, because of the fierceness of his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus hath said the Lord, Desolate shall be the whole land; yet a full end will I not make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this shall mourn the earth, and black shall be the heavens above; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I will not repent, and I will not turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>From the noise of horsemen and those that shoot with the bow fleeth the whole city; they go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And thou, O wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou adorn thyself with ornaments of gold, though thou encircle with paint thy eyes: in vain shalt thou make thyself beautiful; the adulterers will despise thee, thy life will they seek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For a voice as of a woman in travail have I heard, the anguish as of one that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that groaneth, that spreadeth out her hands, saying, "Woe is me now! for my soul succumbeth to the murderers."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and notice, and search in its broad places, if ye can find one man, if there be one that executeth justice, that searcheth for truth: and I will pardon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say, "As the Lord liveth!" surely they only swear to a falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Lord, are not thy eyes directed to the truth? thou didst strike them, but they felt it not; thou didst make an end of them, yet they refused to accept correction: they made their faces harder than a rock, they refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Yet I myself thought, Oh these are but poor; they are foolish; for they knew not the way of the Lord, the ordinance of their God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength; yet from me should destroyers come unto her, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>A sound of a painful cry cometh from Babylon, and of a great breach from the land of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>Because the Lord wasteth Babylon, and destroyeth out of her the loud noise; but their waves roar like great waters, the noise of their voice is sent forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>Because the destroyer is come over her, over Babylon, and her mighty men are caught, every one of their bows is broken; for the God of recompenses, the Lord, will surely requite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make drunken her princes, and her wise men, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awake again, saith the King, The Lord of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Every one of the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; so that nations shall have labored in vain, and the people for the fire, and so shall they have wearied themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Serayah the son of Neriyah, the son of Machseyah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah unto Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Serayah was chief chamberlain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>And Jeremiah wrote down all the evil that should come upon Babylon in one book, namely, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Serayah, As thou comest to Babylon, see to it, that thou read all these words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>And thou shalt say, O Lord, thou thyself hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, so that there shall not be in it an inhabitant, either man or beast; but that it shall become a desolate place for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be, when thou hast finished reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and throw it into the midst of the Euphrates;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again from the evil that I will bring upon her: and her people shall be wearied. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>One and twenty years was Zedekiah old when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Chamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that Jehoyakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass against Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out of his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they encamped against it, and built against it works of attack round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was placed in a state of siege until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, when the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>The city was broken in, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was near the kings garden; while the Chaldeans were round about the city;and they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>And they caught the king, and they brought him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Chamath: and he called him to account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: and also all the princes of Judah did he slaughter in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>And the eyes of Zedekiah did he blind; and the king of Babylon bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in the wardhouse till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the kings house: and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, did he burn with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the walls of Jerusalem round about did all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, pull down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>And certain of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that had been left in the city, and the deserters, that had run away to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But certain of the poorest of the land did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leave for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the pillars of copper that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the copper sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the Chaldeans break, and they carried off all their copper to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>And the pots, and the shovels, and the knives, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of copper wherewith they used to perform the service, did they take away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the basins, and the censers, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the purifyingtubes: of what was of gold the gold, and of what was of silver the silver, did the captain of the guard take away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve copper oxen that served instead of the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the copper of all these vessels could not be weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And as regardeth the pillars, eighteen cubits was the height of each one pillar; and a thread of twelve cubits would compass it; and its thickness was four fingers: it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital was upon it of copper; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of copper. And the like was the case with the second pillar and the pomegranates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And the pomegranates were ninety and six on every side: all the pomegranates upon the network were one hundred round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Serayah the chief priest, and Zephanyah the priest second in rank, and the three doorkeepers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>And out of the city he took a certain courtofficer, who had the supervision of the men of war: and seven men of those that had free access to the kings presence, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army, who ordered to the army the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and led them away unto the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Chamath. Thus Judah was carried away into exile out of his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty and three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar from Jerusalem, eight hundred thirty and two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away into exile of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the exile of Jehoyachin the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the five and twentieth day of the month that Evilmerodach the king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoyachin the king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the prisonhouse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>And he spoke kindly with him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And he changed his prisongarments: and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>And his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, the necessary ration for the day on its day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
