      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, thou art beautiful, my beloved, behold, thou art beautiful: thy dovelike eyes look forth from behind thy vail; thy hair is like a flock of goats, that come quietly down from Mount Gilad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth are like a flock of wellselected sheep, which are come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and there is not one among them that is deprived of her young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Like a thread of scarlet are thy lips, and thy mouth is comely: like the half of a pomegranate is the upper part of thy cheek behind thy vail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Thy neck is like the tower of David built on terraces, a thousand shields hangthereon, all the quivers of the mighty men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day became cool, and the shadows flee away, will I get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>Thou art altogether beautiful, my beloved, and there is no blemish on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon: look about from the top of Amanah, from the top of Senir and Chermon, from the lions dens, from the leopards mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>Thou hast ravished my heart, O my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How beautiful are thy caresses, O my sister, my bride! how much more pleasant are thy caresses than wine! and the smell of thy fragrant oils more than all spices.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A lockedup garden is my sister, my bride; a lockedup spring, a sealed fountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Thy sprouts are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits, copher and spikenard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief of spices;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.15'>A gardenspring, a well of living waters, and flowing down from Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.16'>Awake, O north wind; and come thou, O south; blow over my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my friend come into his garden, and eat its precious fruits.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have plucked my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my sugarcane with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, ye companions; drink, yea, drink abundantly, ye friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I slept, but my heart was awake: there was the voice of my beloved that knocked, "Open for me, my sister, my beloved, my dove, my guiltless one; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my coat: how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet: how shall I defile them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.4'>My friend stretched forth his hand through the opening, and my inmost parts were moved for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up myself to open for my friend; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with fluid myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I indeed opened for my beloved; but my beloved had vanished, and was gone: my soul had failed me while he was speaking; I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he answered me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>Then found me the watchmen that walked about the city; they smote me, they wounded me: they took away my vail from me, they that watched the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him? that I am sick of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>What is thy friend more than anothers friend, O thou fairest of women? what is thy friend more than anothers friend, that thus thou adjurest us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.10'>My friend is white and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.11'>His head is bright as the finest gold, his locks are like waving foliage, and black as a raven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.12'>His eyes are like those of doves by streamlets of waters, bathed in milk, well fitted in their setting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as turrets of sweet perfumes: his lips, like lilies, dropping with fluid myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands are like wheels of gold beset with the chrysolite: his body, an image made of ivory overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are like pillars of marble, resting upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent like the cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.16'>His palate is full of sweets, and every thing in him is agreeable. This is my friend, and this is my beloved, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.6'>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.1'>Whither is thy friend gone, O fairest of women? whither hath thy friend turned himself? that we may seek him with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.2'>My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.3'>I am my friends, and my friend is mine: he that feedeth among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.4'>Thou art beautiful, O my beloved, like Thirzah, comely like Jerusalem, terrible as armies encamped round their banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.5'>Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have excited me: thy hair is like a flock of goats that come quietly down from mount Gilad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.6'>Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and there is not one among them that is deprived of her young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.7'>Like the half of the pomegranate is the upper part of thy cheek behind thy vail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.8'>Sixty are the queens, and eighty the concubines, and the young women without number;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>But one alone is my dove, my guiltless one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the chosen of her that bore her: maidens see her, and call her happy; yea, queens and concubines, and praise her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is this that shineth forth like the morningdawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as armies encamped round their banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>Into the nutgarden was I gone down, to look about among the plants of the valley, to see whether the vine had blossomed, whether the pomegranates had budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>I knew not how it was, my soul made me like the chariots of my noble people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>
          <note>(7:1)</note> Return, return, O Shulammith; return, return, that we may look upon thee. "What will ye see in the Shulammith?" As though it were the dance of a double company.</verse>
