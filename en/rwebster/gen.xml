        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. <note>Eve: Heb. Chavah: that is Living</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.17.1'>And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. <note>perfect: or, upright, or, sincere</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.2'>And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.3'>And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.4'>As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. <note>many…: Heb. multitude of nations</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.5'>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. <note>Abraham: that is, Father of a great multitude</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.6'>And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come forth from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.7'>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.8'>And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. <note>wherein…: Heb. of thy sojournings</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.9'>And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.10'>This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every male among you shall be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.11'>And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.12'>And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed. <note>he that is eight…: Heb. a son of eight days</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.13'>He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.14'>And the uncircumcised male whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.15'>And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. <note>Sarah: that is Princess</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.16'>And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall come from her. <note>she…: Heb. she shall become nations</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.17'>Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.18'>And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.19'>And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.20'>And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.21'>But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.22'>And he finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.23'>And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.24'>And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.25'>And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.26'>In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.27'>And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.18'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.1'>And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.2'>And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.3'>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.4'>Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.5'>And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. <note>comfort: Heb. stay</note><note>are…: Heb. you have passed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.6'>And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. <note>Make ready…: Heb. Hasten</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.7'>And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.8'>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.9'>And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.10'>And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.11'>Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well advanced in years; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.12'>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.13'>And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.14'>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.15'>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.16'>And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.17'>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.18'>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.19'>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.20'>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.21'>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.22'>And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.23'>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.24'>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.25'>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.26'>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.27'>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.28'>Suppose there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.29'>And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Suppose there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.30'>And he said, O let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.31'>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Suppose there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.32'>And he said, O let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Suppose ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.33'>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.19'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.1'>And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.2'>And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.3'>And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.4'>But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.5'>And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.6'>And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.7'>And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.8'>Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.9'>And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.10'>But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.11'>And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.12'>And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.13'>For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them hast become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.14'>And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed to his sons in law as one that mocked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.15'>And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. <note>are here: Heb. are found</note><note>iniquity: or, punishment</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.16'>And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him outside of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.17'>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.18'>And Lot said to them, O, not so, my Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.19'>Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.20'>Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a small one: O, let me escape there, (is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.21'>And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken. <note>thee: Heb. thy face</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.22'>Haste thee, escape there; for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. <note>Zoar: that is, Little</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.23'>The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. <note>risen: Heb. gone forth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.24'>Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.25'>And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.26'>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.27'>And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.28'>And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.29'>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.30'>And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.31'>And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.32'>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.33'>And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.34'>And it came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.35'>And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.36'>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.37'>And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.38'>And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.20'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.1'>And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.2'>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.3'>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife. <note>a man’s…: Heb. married to an husband</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.4'>But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.5'>Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. <note>integrity: or, simplicity, or, sincerity</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.6'>And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I allowed thee not to touch her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.7'>Now therefore restore to the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.8'>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.9'>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What hast thou done to us? and how have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.10'>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.11'>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.12'>And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.13'>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.14'>And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.15'>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. <note>where…: Heb. as is good in thine eyes</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.16'>And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.17'>So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.18'>For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.21'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.1'>And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.2'>For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.3'>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.4'>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.5'>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.6'>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.7'>And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.8'>And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.9'>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.10'>Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.11'>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.12'>And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.13'>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.14'>And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.15'>And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.16'>And she went, and sat her down apart from him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat apart from him, and raised her voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.17'>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.18'>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.19'>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad a drink.</verse>
