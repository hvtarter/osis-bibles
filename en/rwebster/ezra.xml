      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. <note>Jeshua: also called, Joshua</note><note>Zerubbabel: Gr. Zorobabel</note><note>Shealtiel: Gr. Salathiel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. <note>the foundation…: Heb. the temple of the LORD was not yet founded</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. <note>carpenters: or, workmen</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. <note>Judah: also called, Hodaviah</note><note>together: Heb. as one</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers’ houses, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel; <note>the children…: Heb. the sons of the transportation</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. <note>Ahasuerus: Heb. Ahashverosh</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language. <note>Bishlam: or, in peace</note><note>companions: Heb. societies</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: <note>scribe: or, secretary</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, <note>companions: Chaldee, societies</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side of the river, and now. <note>at such…: Chaldee, Cheeneth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>this is the copy of the letter that they sent to him, even to Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>let it be known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the evil city, and have set up the walls, and joined the foundations. <note>set up: or, finished</note><note>joined: Chaldee, sewed together</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up again, then they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt diminish the revenue of the kings. <note>pay: Chaldee, give</note><note>revenue: or, strength</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it was not good for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and informed the king; <note>we have…: Chaldee, we are salted with the salt of the palace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same from of old: for which cause was this city destroyed. <note>moved: Chaldee, made</note><note>within…: Chaldee, in the midst thereof</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We inform the king that, if this city shall be built again, and the walls set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, Peace, and now. <note>companions: Chaldee, societies</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>the letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city from of old hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it. <note>I commanded: Chaldee, by me a decree is set</note><note>made insurrection: Chaldee, lifted up itself</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me. <note>Give…: Chaldee, Make a decree</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the harm of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. <note>by force…: Chaldee, by arm and power</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? <note>make: Chaldee, build</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace. <note>wherein: Chaldee, in the midst whereof</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth quickly, and prospereth in their hands. <note>great…: Chaldee, stones of rolling</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to finish these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; <note>governor: or, deputy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Now therefore, if it seemeth good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the books, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. <note>rolls: Chaldee, books</note><note>laid up: Chaldee, made to descend</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.2'>And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a scroll, and in it was a record thus written: <note>Achmetha: or, Ecbatana, or, in a coffer</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the height of it sixty cubits, and the breadth of it sixty cubits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and place them in the house of God. <note>brought again: Chaldee, go</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.6'>Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, keep away from there: <note>your…: Chaldee, their societies</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.7'>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.8'>Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be given immediately to these men, that they be not hindered. <note>I make…: Chaldee, by me a decree is made</note><note>hindered: Chaldee, made to cease</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.9'>And that which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.10'>That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. <note>of sweet…: Chaldee, of rest</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.11'>Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. <note>let him…: Chaldee, let him be destroyed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.12'>And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall try to alter the decree and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.13'>Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.14'>And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. <note>commandment: Chaldee, decree</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.15'>And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.16'>And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, <note>the children of the captivity: Chaldee, the sons of the transportation</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.17'>And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.18'>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. <note>as it is…: Chaldee, according to the writing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.19'>And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>And the children of Israel, who had returned from captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.22'>And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.1'>Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.6'>This Ezra went from Babylon; and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.7'>And there went some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.8'>And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.9'>For upon the first day of the first month he began to go from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. <note>began…: Heb. was the foundation of the going up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.10'>For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.11'>Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.13'>I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are disposed of their own freewill to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.25'>And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.26'>And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. <note>to banishment: Chaldee, to rooting out</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.15'>And I gathered them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. <note>abode: or, pitched</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>And I said to them, Ye are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.30'>So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.31'>Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.36'>And they delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s satraps, and to the governors on this side of the river: and they helped the people, and the house of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this trespass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And now for a little moment grace hath been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. <note>space: Heb. moment</note><note>a nail: or, a pin: that is, a constant and sure abode</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we were slaves; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. <note>to repair: Heb. to set up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, where ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. <note>by: Heb. by the hand of</note><note>from…: Heb. from mouth to mouth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; <note>hast punished…: Heb. hast withheld beneath our iniquities</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>Should we again break thy commandments, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? wouldest thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?</verse>
