      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: <note>Josiah…: some read, Josiah begat Jehoiakim, and Jehoiakim begat Jeconiah</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. <note>conceived: Gr. begotten</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. <note>JESUS: that is, Saviour, Heb</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. <note>they…: or, his name shall be called</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he enquired of them where the Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. <note>rule: or, feed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. <note>presented: or, offered</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceeding angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its surrounding lands, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>In Ramah was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead who sought the young child’s life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there: however, being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leather belt about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region about Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance: <note>meet…: or, answerable to amendment of life</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you in water to repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit, and in fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said to him, Permit it to be so now: for thus it is befitting for us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he allowed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall uphold, thee, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. <note>tempt: or, try, or, put to trial, or, proof</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil taketh him up upon an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And saith to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then saith Jesus to him, Away with thee, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; <note>cast…: or, delivered up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness saw great light; and to them who sat in the region and shadow of death light hath shone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame spread throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were sick with various diseases and torments, and those who were possessed with demons, and those who were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up to a mountain: and when he was seated, his disciples came to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. <note>falsely: Gr. lying</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt hath lost its savour, how shall it be salted? it is then good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand; and it giveth light to all that are in the house. <note>a bushel: the word in the original signifieth a measure containing about a pint less than a peck</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth shall pass away, one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no way enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: <note>by: or, to</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. <note>Raca: that is, Vain fellow</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if thou shalt bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with thy adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say to thee, Thou shalt by no means come out from there, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if thy right eye shall cause thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <note>offend…: or, do cause thee to offend</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand shall cause thee to sin, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It hath been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of immorality, causeth her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thy oaths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatever is more than these cometh of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, That ye resist not evil: but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.3'>And said, Verily I say to you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.4'>Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.5'>And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>Woe to the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>Therefore if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to sin, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>And if thy eye causeth thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.10'>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.11'>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.12'>How think ye? if a man hath an hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go to the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.13'>And if so be that he findeth it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that sheep, than over the ninety and nine which went not astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.14'>Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.16'>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.18'>Verily I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.19'>Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, who would take account of his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents. <note>talents: a talent is seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver, which after five shillings the ounce is one hundred and eighty–seven pounds ten shillings</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>But as he had nothing with which to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <note>worshipped him: or, besought him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, who owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest. <note>pence: the Roman penny is the eighth part of an ounce, which after five shillings the ounce is seven pence halfpenny; about fourteen cents</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord, having called him, said to him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou didst beg me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Shouldest thou not also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the torturers, till he should pay all that was due to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell them who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>And the remnant took his servants, and treated them spitefully, and slew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>But when the king heard of it, he was angry: and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he saith to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, invite to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not a wedding garment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>And he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are called, but few are chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a penny. <note>penny: in value seven pence halfpenny</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>And he saith to them, Whose is this image and superscription? <note>superscription: or, inscription</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They say to him, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, died, and, having no issue, left his wife to his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh. <note>seventh: Gr. seven</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>And last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>Then one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The Son of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>And consulted that they might take Jesus by guile, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he was eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>When Jesus understood it, he said to them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, what this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>And said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they agreed with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. <note>blessed it: many Greek copies have gave thanks</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then saith Jesus to them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. <note>offended: or, though the faith of other men should be shaken and fail, yet mine will be firm and constant</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, That this night, before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder, and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, Friend, why art thou come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one of them who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these testify against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say to you, After this shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, <note>the palms…: or, rods</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; <note>whom…: or, whom they bought of the children of Israel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he answered to him never a word; so that the governor marvelled greatly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>When he was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down they watched him there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The thieves also, who were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land to the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many women were there beholding from afar off, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, make it as secure as ye can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went, and having sealed the stone, made the sepulchre secure, with a watch.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. <note>was: or, had been</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him the keepers shook, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear ye not: for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and ran to bring word to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this shall come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to me in heaven and upon earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: <note>teach…: or, make disciples, or, Christians of all nations</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.</verse>
