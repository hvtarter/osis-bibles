        <verse osisID='Ps.77.8'>Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? <note>for evermore: Heb. to generation and generation?</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.2'>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.3'>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.4'>We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.5'>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.6'>That the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.7'>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.8'>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. <note>that…: Heb. that prepared not their heart</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.9'>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. <note>carrying: Heb. throwing forth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.10'>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.11'>And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.12'>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.13'>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.14'>In the day time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.15'>He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.16'>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.17'>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.18'>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.19'>Yea, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? <note>furnish: Heb. order</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.20'>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.21'>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was full of wrath: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.22'>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.23'>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.24'>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the grain of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.25'>Man ate angels’ food: he sent them food to the full. <note>Man…: or, Every one did eat the bread of the mighty</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.26'>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. <note>to blow: Heb. to go</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.27'>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: <note>feathered…: Heb. fowl of wing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.28'>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.29'>So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.30'>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.31'>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. <note>smote…: Heb. made to bow</note><note>chosen…: or, young men</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.32'>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.33'>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.34'>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.35'>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.36'>Nevertheless they would flatter him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.37'>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.38'>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.39'>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.40'>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! <note>provoke: or, rebel against</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.41'>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.42'>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. <note>from…: or, from affliction</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.43'>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: <note>wrought: Heb. set</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.44'>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they could not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.45'>He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.46'>He gave also their increase to the caterpiller, and their labour to the locust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.47'>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. <note>destroyed: Heb. killed</note><note>frost: or, great hailstones</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.48'>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. <note>gave…: Heb. shut up</note><note>hot…: or, lightnings</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.49'>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.50'>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; <note>He made…: Heb. He weighed a path</note><note>life…: or, beasts to the murrain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.51'>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.52'>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.53'>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <note>overwhelmed: Heb. covered</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.54'>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.55'>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.56'>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.57'>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.58'>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.59'>When God heard this, he was filled with wrath, and greatly abhorred Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.60'>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>He gave over his people also to the sword; and was filled with wrath with his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. <note>given…: Heb. praised</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.64'>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. <note>established: Heb. founded</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep folds:</verse>
