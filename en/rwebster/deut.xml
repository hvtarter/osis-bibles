      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Zuph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <note>the Red…: or, Zuph</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places near to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates. <note>all…: Heb. all his neighbours</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them. <note>set: Heb. given</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I alone bear your weight, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take for yourselves wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. <note>Take: Heb. Give</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. <note>made: Heb. gave</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it. <note>respect…: Heb. acknowledge faces</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And ye came near to me each one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land for us, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up to the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>However ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where can we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. <note>discouraged: Heb. melted</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God who goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath walked upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. <note>wholly…: Heb. fulfilled to go after</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>But Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in there: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up to the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up to the hill. <note>went…: Heb. ye were presumptuous, and went up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we went around mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And the LORD spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Ye have gone around this mountain long enough: turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the land of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: therefore take ye good heed to yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession. <note>no…: Heb. even to the treading of the sole of the foot</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession. <note>Distress…: or, Use no hostility against Moab</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horims also dwelt in Seir in times past; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them. <note>succeeded: Heb. inherited</note><note>stead: or, room</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise, said I, and pass over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. <note>brook: or, valley</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we passed the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from among the host, as the LORD swore to them. <note>brook: or, valley</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>That the LORD spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the border of Moab, this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when thou comest near the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt there in times past; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; <note>Zamzummims: also called, Zuzims</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. <note>begin…: Heb. begin, possess</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: <note>the men…: Heb. every city of men, and women, and little ones</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the borders of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>The plain also, and Jordan, and the border of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. <note>Ashdothpisgah: or, the springs of Pisgah, or, the hill</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are fit for the war. <note>meet…: Heb. sons of power</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man to his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms where thou passest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. <note>Pisgah: or, the hill</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley opposite Bethpeor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</verse>
