      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The LORD hath been very angry with your fathers. <note>sore…: Heb. with displeasure</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye to me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. <note>take…: or, overtake</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. <note>speckled: or, bay</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comforting words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel that talked with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very very angry with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. <note>prosperity: Heb. good</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head: but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then said I, Where goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth, and what is its length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire on every side, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. <note>his…: Heb. the habitation of his holiness</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. <note>Satan: that is, an adversary</note><note>to…: Heb. to be his adversary</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. <note>charge: or, ordinance</note><note>places…: Heb. walks</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy companions that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. <note>wondered…: Heb. of wonder, or, sign</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving of it, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that talked with me came again, and woke me, as a man that is awakened from his sleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which were upon the top of it: <note>a bowl: Heb. her bowl</note><note>seven pipes…: or, seven several pipes to the lamps</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. <note>might: or, army</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth its headstone with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. <note>for they…: or, since the seven eyes of the LORD shall rejoice</note><note>plummet: Heb. stone of tin</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the lampstand and upon its left side?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered again, and said to him, What are these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? <note>through: Heb. by the hand of</note><note>empty…: or, empty out of themselves oil into the gold</note><note>the golden oil: Heb. the gold</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then said he to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. <note>every one that stealeth…: or, every one of this people that stealeth holdeth himself guiltless, as it doth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thy eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. <note>talent: or, weighty piece</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me, To build for it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot spotted and bay horses. <note>bay: or, strong</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. <note>spirits: or, winds</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>The black horses which are in it go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Go from here, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then he cried upon me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, who are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: <note>grow…: or, branch up from under him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, <note>pray…: Heb. intreat the face of</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>And to speak to the priests who were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? <note>did not ye: or, be not ye they that</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and its cities around it, when men inhabited the south and the plain? <note>Should…: or, Are not these the words</note><note>by: Heb. by the hand of</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother: <note>Execute…: Heb. Judge judgment of truth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. <note>pulled…: Heb. they gave a backsliding shoulder</note><note>stopped: Heb. made heavy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. <note>by: Heb. by the hand of</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. <note>pleasant…: Heb. land of desire</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. <note>very…: Heb. multitude of days</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it is marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in my eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. <note>marvellous: or, hard, or, difficult</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; <note>the west…: Heb. the country of the going down of the sun</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, who were in the day when the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. <note>there was…: or, the hire of man became nothing</note></verse>
