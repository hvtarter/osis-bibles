      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. <note>hasteth: Heb. panteth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about to the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from which the rivers come, there they return again. <note>return…: Heb. return to go</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there any thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this grievous labour hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised with it. <note>to be…: or, to afflict them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is lacking cannot be numbered. <note>that which is wanting: Heb. defect</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I spoke to my own heart, saying, Lo, I have come to great estate, and have gained more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <note>had…: Heb. had seen much</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will test thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. <note>to give…: Heb. to draw my flesh with wine</note><note>all…: Heb. the number of the days of their life</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made for myself great works; I built houses; I planted vineyards:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made me pools of water, to water with them the wood that bringeth forth trees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I procured me male and female servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks above all that were in Jerusalem before me: <note>servants born…: Heb. sons of my house</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the special treasure of kings and of the provinces: I procured me male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and of all sorts. <note>musical…: Heb. musical instrument and instruments</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. <note>even…: or, in those things which have been already done</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. <note>that…: Heb. that there is an excellency in wisdom more than in folly, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. <note>happeneth even…: Heb. happeneth to me, even to me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me. <note>taken: Heb. laboured</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour in which I have laboured, and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured in it shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <note>leave: Heb. give</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, in which he hath laboured under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are sorrows, and his labour grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. <note>should make…: or, delight his senses</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who else can hasten to it, more than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For God giveth to a man who is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth toil, to gather and to store up wealth, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. <note>in his…: Heb. before him</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <note>to be…: Heb. to bear</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; <note>to refrain from: Heb. to be far from</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; <note>get: or, seek</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit hath he that worketh in that in which he laboureth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the labour, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He hath made every thing beautiful in its time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. <note>that which is past: Heb. that which is driven away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men, that God might surely test them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. <note>that God…: or, that they might clear God, and see, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? <note>of man: Heb. of the sons of man</note><note>goeth upward: Heb. is ascending, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Therefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <note>side: Heb. hand</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Yea, better is he than both they, who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all labour, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. <note>every…: Heb. all the rightness of work</note><note>for this…: Heb. this is the envy of a man from his neighbour</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with toil and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a grievous labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no longer be admonished. <note>who…: Heb. who knoweth not to be admonished</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For out of prison he cometh to reign; though also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. <note>thing: or, word</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice is known by a multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Permit not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also many vanities: but fear thou God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, wonder not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there are higher than they. <note>at the…: Heb. at the will, or, purpose</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners of them, except the beholding of them with their eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eateth little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners of them to their hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>But those riches perish by evil labour: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold that which I have seen: it is good and proper for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. <note>it is good…: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc</note><note>all the days: Heb. the number of the days</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. <note>For…: or, Though he give not much, yet he remembereth, etc</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man begetteth an hundred children, and liveth many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with good, and also that he hath no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For he cometh with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yea, though he liveth a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. <note>appetite: Heb. soul</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. <note>than…: Heb. than the walking of the soul</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? <note>all…: Heb. the number of the days of the life of his vanity</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</verse>

See, or, Enjoy life</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where thou goest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</verse>
