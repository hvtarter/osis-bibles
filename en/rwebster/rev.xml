      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>Who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it: for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>And hath made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear them who are evil: and thou hast tried them who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from which thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s throne is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit acts of immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth except he that receiveth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>However I have a few things against thee, because thou allowest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit acts of immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time to repent of her immorality; and she repented not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give to each one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; <note>of the Laodiceans: or, in Laodicea</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thy eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man shall hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show thee things which must be after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he that sat was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius stone: and there was a rainbow around the throne, in sight like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And in front of the throne there was a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living beings full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living being was like a lion, and the second living being like a calf, and the third living being had a face as a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living beings had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come. <note>rest…: Gr. have no rest</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when those living beings give glory and honour and thanks to him that is seated on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the book, the four living beings and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. <note>odours: or, incense</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And hast made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living beings and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living beings said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living beings saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living being say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat on him to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. <note>A measure: the word choenix signifieth a measure containing one wine quart, and the twelfth part of a quart</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. <note>unto them: or, to him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind. <note>untimely figs: or, green figs</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and isle were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>Then saith he to me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the words of this book: worship God.</verse>
