      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John was baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. <note>for: or, unto</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a leather belt around his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed have baptized you in water: but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: <note>opened: or, cloven, or, rent</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when he had gone a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region surrounding Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>But the mother of Simon’s wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the demons to speak, because they knew him. <note>to speak…: or, to say that they knew him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And when they had found him, they said to him, All men seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for this purpose have I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out, and began to proclaim it freely, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come to him, bringing one sick with the palsy, who was borne by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not come near to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the sick with the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick with the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier to say to the sick with the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick with the palsy,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go into thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. <note>at the…: or, at the place where the custom was received</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus was eating in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with tax collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, he saith to them, They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the tear is made worse. <note>new cloth: or, raw, or, unwrought cloth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles. <note>bottles: or, sacks of skin</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass, that he went through the grain fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he saith to the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth. <note>Stand forth: Gr. Arise, stand forth in the midst</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored as whole as the other. <note>hardness: or, blindness</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many; so that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had afflictions. <note>pressed: or, rushed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goeth up upon a mountain, and calleth to him whom he would: and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>And to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And Simon he surnamed Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they went into an house. <note>into…: or, home</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they sayd, He is beside himself. <note>friends: or, kinsmen</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem sayd, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casteth out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and plunder his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they shall blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And he looked around on them who sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered to him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hearken; Behold, a sower went out to sow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said to them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are outside, all these things are done in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower soweth the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they fall away. <note>offended: or, stumbled, or, caused to fall into sin</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are they who are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. <note>lusts: or, inordinate desires</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are they who are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand? <note>bushel: the word in the original signifieth a less measure</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be revealed; neither hath any thing been kept secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear: with the measure which ye measure, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the ripe grain in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. <note>brought…: or, ripe</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But without a parable he spoke not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was on the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said to him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was there near to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon, and also concerning the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beseech him to depart out of their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>However Jesus permitted him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them what great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he departed, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, many people gathered to him: and he was near to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a certain woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked around to see her that had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace, and be healed of thy affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain who sayd, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he permitted no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed at him. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the child, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And he took the child by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the child arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he calleth to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them authority over unclean spirits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in their purse: <note>money: the word signifieth a piece of brass money, in value somewhat less than a farthing, but here it is taken in general for money</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for some of them came from far.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, From where can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments of food that were left, seven baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, and entering into the boat again departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>And when Jesus knew it, he saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>And he said to them, How is it that ye do not understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and besought him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And he looked up, and sayd, I see men as trees, walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>And he saith to them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith to him, Thou art the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>And when he had called the people to him with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>And they all forsook him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the courtyard of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony agreed not together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>And there arose certain, and bore false testimony against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But neither so did their testimony agree together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these testify against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the soldiers struck him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was down in the courtyard, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech showeth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him, Before the cock shall crow twice, thou shalt deny me three times. And when he thought about it, he wept. <note>when…: or, he wept abundantly, or, he began to weep</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou sayest it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they testify against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whom they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answered and said again to them, What will ye then that I shall do to him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. <note>Praetorium: or, the palace, or, hall of audience</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And began to greet him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compelled one Simon a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let him alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now when the evening was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if he was already dead: and calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he knew it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came to the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he saith to them, Be not amazed: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told it to the rest: neither believed they them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they sat eating, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen. <note>at meat: or, together</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</verse>
