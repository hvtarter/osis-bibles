        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: <note>after…: Gr. worthy of God</note></verse>
