      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <note>abundant: Gr. much</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, <note>for you: or, for us</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In this ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through various temptations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though tried with fire, might be found to praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Of this salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ who was in them did signify, when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they ministered the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; <note>to the end: Gr. perfectly</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all your behaviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain way of life received by tradition from your fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>Who by him do believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to a sincere love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and its flower falleth away: <note>For: or, For that</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that ye may grow by it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>To whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. <note>are: or, be ye</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>To you therefore who believe he is precious: but to them who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner, <note>precious: or, an honour</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them who stumble at the word, being disobedient: to this also they were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a special people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: <note>peculiar: or, purchased</note><note>praises: or, virtues</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Who in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Having your behaviour honest among the Gentiles: that, though they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. <note>whereas: or, wherein</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. <note>using: Gr. having</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. <note>Honour all: or, Esteem all</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the perverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endureth grief, suffering wrongfully. <note>thankworthy: or, thank</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory is it, if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye bear it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye bear it patiently, this is acceptable with God. <note>acceptable: or, thank</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For even to this were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: <note>for us: some read, for you</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>Who committed no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: <note>himself: or, his cause</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. <note>on: or, to</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the behaviour of the wives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>While they behold your chaste behaviour coupled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of arranging the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any terror. <note>daughters: Gr. children</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one for another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: <note>love as: or, loving to the</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>Not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling: but on the contrary blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, that ye should inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. <note>against: Gr. upon</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he that will harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: <note>fear: or, reverence</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Having a good conscience; that, though they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good behaviour in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if the will of God is so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>By whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>Who at one time were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>The like figure to which even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in licentiousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In which they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober minded, and watch to prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover a multitude of sins. <note>shall: or, will</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If any man speaketh, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man ministereth, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>Yet if any man suffereth as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first beginneth with us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight of it, not by constraint, but willingly; not for dishonest gain, but from a ready mind; <note>which…: or, as much as in you is</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being examples to the flock. <note>being lords over: or, overruling</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, greeteth you; and so doth Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
