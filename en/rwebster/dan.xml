  <div type='book' osisID='Dan'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Children in whom was no blemish, but of good appearance, and skilful in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end of which they might stand before the king. <note>the wine…: Heb. the wine of his drink</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and compassion with the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the children who are of your age? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. <note>worse…: Heb. sadder</note><note>sort: or, term, or, continuance?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <note>Melzar: or, the steward</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Test thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink. <note>pulse: Heb. of pulse</note><note>to eat…: Heb. that we may eat, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s food: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he consented to them in this matter, and tried them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king’s food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <note>Daniel…: or, he made Daniel understand</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king talked with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. <note>wisdom…: Heb. wisdom of understanding</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, by which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syrian, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. <note>O king…: (Chaldee, to the end of chapter seven)</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a refuse heap. <note>cut…: Chaldee, made pieces</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation of it. <note>rewards: or, fee</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. <note>gain: Chaldee, buy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if ye will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can reveal the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that hath asked such things of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: <note>answered…: Chaldee, returned</note><note>captain…: or, chief marshal: Chaldee, chief of the executioners, or, slaughtermen</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <note>of the God: Chaldee, from before God</note><note>that Daniel…: or, that they should not destroy Daniel, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known to us the king’s matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will reveal to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation. <note>I have…: Chaldee, That I have found</note><note>captives…: Chaldee, children of the captivity of Judah</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, cannot reveal to the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; <note>maketh…: Chaldee, hath made known</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass after this: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. <note>came: Chaldee, came up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart. <note>but for…: or, but for the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and its form was terrible. <note>sawest: Chaldee, wast seeing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>The head of this image was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, <note>thighs: or, sides</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces. <note>without…: or, which was not in hands</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And though thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. <note>broken: or, brittle</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And though thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. <note>one…: Chaldee, this with this</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. <note>the days: Chaldee, their days</note><note>the kingdom: Chaldee, the kingdom thereof</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass after this: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure. <note>without…: or, which was not in hands</note><note>hereafter: Chaldee, after this</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, <note>aloud: Chaldee, with might</note><note>it…: Chaldee, they command</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: <note>dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee, symphony</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whoever falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image: <note>dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee, symphony</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And whoever falleth not down and worshippeth, that he shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. <note>have…: Chaldee, have set no regard upon thee</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? <note>true: or, of purpose</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? <note>dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee, symphony</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was heated before. <note>full: Chaldee, filled</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <note>most…: Chaldee, mighty of strength</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <note>coats: or, mantles</note><note>hats: or, turbans</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. <note>commandment: Chaldee, word</note><note>flame: or, spark</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king. <note>counsellors: or, governors</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. <note>they…: Chaldee, there is no hurt in them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth from the midst of the fire. <note>mouth: Chaldee, door</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a refuse heap: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. <note>I make…: Chaldee, a decree is made by me</note><note>any…: Chaldee, error</note><note>cut…: Chaldee, made pieces</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon. <note>promoted: Chaldee, made to prosper</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. <note>I thought…: Chaldee, It was seemly before me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. <note>I saw: Chaldee, I was seeing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt among its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts escape from under it, and the fowls from its branches: <note>aloud: Chaldee, with might</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation of it, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thy enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit of it abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of heaven had their habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And in that the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times shall pass over him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And though they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. <note>a lengthening…: or, an healing of thine error</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. <note>in: or, upon</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom hath departed from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.5'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink in them. <note>father: or, grandfather</note><note>taken: Chaldee, brought forth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.3'>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.4'>They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.5'>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.6'>Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. <note>countenance: Chaldee, brightnesses</note><note>was changed: Chaldee, changed it</note><note>joints: or, girdles: Chaldee, bindings, or, knots</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.7'>The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation of it, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. <note>aloud: Chaldee, with might</note><note>scarlet: or, purple</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.8'>Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.9'>Then was the king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were confused. <note>countenance: Chaldee, brightnesses</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.10'>Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.11'>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; <note>father: or, grandfather</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, the interpreting of dreams, and declaring of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation. <note>interpreting: or, of an interpreter</note><note>dissolving: or, of a dissolver</note><note>doubts: Chaldee, knots</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.13'>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? <note>father: or, grandfather</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.14'>I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.15'>And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.16'>And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. <note>make interpretations: Chaldee, interpret, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.17'>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation. <note>rewards: or, fee</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.18'>O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.19'>And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: <note>in pride: or, to deal proudly</note><note>deposed: Chaldee, made to come down</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.21'>And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomever he will. <note>his heart…: or, he made his heart equal, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.22'>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.23'>But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, thou hast not glorified:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.25'>And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.26'>This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.27'>TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.28'>PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.29'>Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.30'>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.31'>And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about sixty and two years old. <note>being…: Chaldee, he as the son of, etc</note><note>about: or, now</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.6'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.1'>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, who should be over the whole kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.2'>And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should suffer no loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.6'>Then these presidents and princes assembled to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever. <note>assembled…: or, came tumultuously</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. <note>decree: or, interdict</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. <note>altereth not: Chaldee, passeth not</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>Then the king, when he heard these words, was much displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the setting of the sun to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.16'>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.17'>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him. <note>instruments…: or, table</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.23'>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.24'>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.25'>Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.26'>I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.27'>He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. <note>power: Chaldee, hand</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.28'>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.7'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. <note>had: Chaldee, saw</note><note>matters: or, words</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. <note>and it: or, wherewith it</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh. <note>it raised…: or, it raised up one dominion</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the remainder with its feet: and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. <note>their lives…: Chaldee, a prolonging in life was given them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. <note>body: Chaldee, sheath</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. <note>most…: Chaldee, high ones, that is, things, or, places</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the remainder with his feet; <note>from…: Chaldee, from all those</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. <note>the other: Heb. the second</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. <note>touched…: or, none touched him in the earth</note><note>a notable…: Heb. a horn of sight</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>Therefore the male goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it grew great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. <note>to the host: or, against the host</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. <note>to: or, against</note><note>by him: or, from him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it continued, and prospered. <note>an host…: or, the host was given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint who spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? <note>that…: or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wonderful numberer: Heb. Palmoni</note><note>of…: or, making desolate</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said to me, Until two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. <note>days: Heb. evening morning</note><note>cleansed: Heb. justified</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'>And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. <note>set…: Heb. made me stand upon my standing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.20'>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.21'>And the rough goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.22'>Now that being broken, though four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. <note>are…: Heb. are accomplished</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and continue, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. <note>holy…: Heb. people of the holy ones</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>And through his policy also he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. <note>peace: or, prosperity</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: therefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</verse>
