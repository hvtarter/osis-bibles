      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry: for the land hath committed great harlotry, departing from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. <note>avenge: Heb. visit</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said to him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. <note>Loruhamah: that is, Not having obtained mercy</note><note>no…: Heb. not add any more to</note><note>but…: or, that I should altogether pardon them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. <note>Loammi: that is, Not my people</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said to them, Ye are the sons of the living God. <note>in…: or, instead of that</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up from the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye to your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. <note>Ammi: that is, My people</note><note>Ruhamah: that is, Having obtained mercy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your mother, contend: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her harlotry out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink. <note>drink: Heb. drinks</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. <note>make…: Heb. wall a wall</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. <note>wine: Heb. new wine</note><note>which…: or, wherewith they made Baal</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I return, and take away my grain in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. <note>recover: or, take away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand. <note>lewdness: Heb. folly, or, villany</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. <note>destroy: Heb. make desolate</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will judge her for the days of Baalim, in which she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak kindly to her. <note>comfortably: or, friendly: Heb. to her heart</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. <note>Ishi: that is, My husband</note><note>Baali: that is, My lord</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth thee to me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>And the earth shall hear the grain, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved by her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. <note>of wine: Heb. of grapes</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: <note>half…: Heb. lethech</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said to her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: <note>image: Heb. a standing, or, statue, or, pillar</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. <note>blood: Heb. bloods</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man contend, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that contend with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. <note>destroy: Heb. cut off</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. <note>destroyed: Heb. cut off</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. <note>set…: Heb. lift up their soul to</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. <note>punish: Heb. visit upon</note><note>reward: Heb. cause to return</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase: because they have stopped taking heed to to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Harlotry and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their idols, and their staff declareth to them: for the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot departing from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because their shadow is pleasant: therefore your daughters shall commit harlotry, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for they themselves are separated with harlots, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. <note>I will not: or, Shall I not</note><note>fall: or, be punished</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though thou, Israel, playest the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah were like them that remove a landmark: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers plunder outside. <note>wickedness: Heb. evils</note><note>spoileth: Heb. strippeth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them on every side; they are before my face. <note>consider…: Heb. say not to</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. <note>made…: or, applied</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth to me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. <note>thy: Heb. the roof of thy</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made for themselves idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if it shall yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. <note>stalk: or, standing corn</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which is no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. <note>lovers: Heb. loves</note></verse>
