      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. <note>yearly: Heb. from year to year</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had closed up her womb. <note>worthy: or, double</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had closed up her womb. <note>provoked: Heb. angered</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. <note>when…: or, from the time that she, etc: Heb. from her going up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly. <note>in…: Heb. bitter of soul</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. <note>a man…: Heb. seed of men</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth. <note>continued…: Heb. multiplied to pray</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah, spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunk? put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. <note>of a sorrowful…: Heb. hard of spirit</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I been speaking. <note>complaint: or, meditation</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>Therefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. <note>when…: Heb. in revolution of days</note><note>Samuel: that is, Asked of God</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew a bull, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there. <note>lent him: or, returned him, whom I have obtained by petition</note><note>he shall…: or, he whom I have obtained by petition shall be returned</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let no arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. <note>arrogancy: Heb. hard</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they knew not the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priests’ custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force. <note>presently: Heb. as on the day</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home. <note>loan…: or, petition which she asked, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <note>assembled: Heb. assembled by troops</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. <note>of your…: or, evil words of you</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress. <note>transgress: or, cry out</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall plead for him? However they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why trample ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. <note>an enemy…: or, the affliction of the tabernacle, for all the wealth which God would have given Israel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart: and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age. <note>in the flower…: Heb. men</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. <note>Put: Heb. Join</note><note>one of…: or, somewhat about the priesthood</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, that he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was lying down to sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him. <note>Now…: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the LORD, and before the word of the LORD was revealed unto him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. <note>when…: Heb. beginning and ending</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. <note>For I…: or, And I will tell him</note><note>vile: or, accursed</note><note>restrained…: Heb. frowned not upon them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me of all the things that he said to thee. <note>more also: Heb. so add</note><note>thing: or, word</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him every thing, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. <note>every…: Heb. all the things, or, words</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. <note>established: or, faithful</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. <note>came: or, came to pass: Heb. was</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. <note>they joined…: Heb. the battle was spread</note><note>army: Heb. array</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies. <note>fetch: Heb. take unto us</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing before. <note>heretofore: Heb. yesterday, or, the third day</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight. <note>quit…: Heb. be men</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. <note>were slain: Heb. died</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. <note>were dim: Heb. stood</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? <note>is…: Heb. is the thing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king. <note>witchcraft: Heb. divination</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it tore.</verse>
