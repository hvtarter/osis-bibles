      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not get warm. <note>stricken…: Heb. entered into days</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warm. <note>Let there…: Heb. Let them seek</note><note>a young…: Heb. a damsel, a virgin</note><note>cherish…: Heb. be a cherisher unto him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the land of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <note>be king: Heb. reign</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very handsome man; and his mother bore him after Absalom. <note>at any…: Heb. from his days</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him. <note>he…: Heb. his words were with</note><note>following…: Heb. helped after Adonijah</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and invited all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants: <note>Enrogel: or, the well Rogel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Therefore Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words. <note>confirm: Heb. fill up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? <note>What…: Heb. What to thee?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. <note>offenders: Heb. sinners</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And, lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. <note>God…: Heb. Let king Adonijah live</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown it to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king. <note>into…: Heb. before the king</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: <note>mine…: Heb. which belongeth to me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them. <note>pipes: or, flutes</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and wherever thou turnest thyself: <note>prosper: or, do wisely</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. <note>fail…: Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. <note>shed: Heb. put</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. <note>grievous: Heb. strong</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his gray head do thou bring down to the grave with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on. <note>deny…: Heb. turn not away my face</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted. <note>worthy…: Heb. a man of death</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, that is, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there to any place whatever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be, that on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is aware of, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thy own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon allied himself with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</verse>
