      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the setting of the sun, shall be your land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them. <note>unto this…: or, thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper wherever thou goest. <note>prosper: or, do wisely</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written in it: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. <note>have…: or, do wisely</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee wherever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; <note>armed: Heb. marshalled by five</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’S servant gave you on this side of Jordan toward the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and wherever thou sendest us, we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there. <note>sent: or, had sent</note><note>lodged: Heb. lay</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not where they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it came to pass about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. <note>faint: Heb. melt</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. <note>did there…: Heb. rose up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father’s house, and give me a true token:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. <note>for…: Heb. instead of you to die</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home to thee. <note>bring: Heb. gather</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be free of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us. <note>faint: Heb. melt</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they departed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way before. <note>heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, and the third day</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in an heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people departed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over opposite Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had finished crossing the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the people had finished crossing the Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command ye them, saying, Take for yourselves from here out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? <note>in time…: Heb. to morrow</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spoke Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had finished crossing, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho. <note>prepared: or, ready armed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before. <note>lifted…: Heb. plucked up</note><note>flowed: Heb. went</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? <note>in time…: Heb. to morrow</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever. <note>for ever: Heb. all days</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. <note>sharp…: or, knives of flints</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. <note>sharp…: or, knives of flints</note><note>the hill…: or, Gibeah–haaraloth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were healed. <note>they had…: Heb. the people had made an end to be circumcised</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day. <note>Gilgal: that is Rolling</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the old grain of the land on the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and roasted grain in the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the next day after they had eaten of the old grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant? <note>captain: or, prince</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of the LORD’S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place on which thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. <note>was…: Heb. did shut up, and was shut up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and the mighty men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And ye shall march around the city, all ye men of war, and go round the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him. <note>flat: Heb. under it</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, Pass on, and march around the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. <note>rereward: Heb. gathering host</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>And ye, in every way keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. <note>accursed: or, devoted</note><note>a curse: or, devoted</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.15.1'>This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.15.2'>And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: <note>bay: Heb. tongue</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.15.18'>And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.15.19'>Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the lower springs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.16.1'>And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, <note>fell: Heb. went forth</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.16.4'>So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.16.5'>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, to Bethhoron the upper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.16.6'>And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.17'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.1'>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; that is, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.2'>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male offspring of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families. <note>Abiezer: also called, Jeezer</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.3'>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.4'>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.5'>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.6'>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.7'>And the land of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of Entappuah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.8'>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.9'>And the border descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the ends of it were at the sea: <note>river Kanah: or, brook of reeds</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.10'>Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.11'>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even three countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.12'>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.13'>Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour; but did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.14'>And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me until now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.15'>And Joshua answered them, If thou art a great people, then go up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too small for thee. <note>giants: or, Rephaims</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.16'>And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and its towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.17'>And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.17.18'>But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a forest, and thou shalt cut it down: and the borders of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.18.1'>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.2'>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.3'>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long will ye neglect to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.4'>Pick out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.5'>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their land on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their land on the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.6'>Ye shall therefore describe the land in seven parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.7'>But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.8'>And the men arose, and departed: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.18.9'>And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.15'>And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>And the people answered and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. <note>holy God: Heb. holy Gods</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If ye forsake the LORD, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.</verse>
