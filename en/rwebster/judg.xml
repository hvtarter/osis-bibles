      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adonibezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God hath repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. <note>their thumbs…: Heb. the thumbs of their hands and of their feet</note><note>gathered: or, gleaned</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley. <note>valley: or, low country</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with its land, and Askelon with its land, and Ekron with its land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. <note>drave…: or, possessed the mountain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour, and did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became forced labourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became forced labourers to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not allow them to come down to the valley:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became forced labourers. <note>prevailed: Heb. was heavy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward. <note>the going…: or, Maalehacrabbim</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. <note>angel: or, messenger</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD. <note>Bochim: that is, Weepers</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. <note>outlived: Heb. prolonged days after</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. <note>Timnathheres: also called, Timnathserah</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. <note>delivered: Heb. saved</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. <note>corrupted…: or, were corrupt</note><note>ceased…: Heb. let nothing fall of their</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>That through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily; neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua. <note>left: or, suffered</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were to test Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. <note>Mesopotamia: Heb. Aramnaharaim</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. <note>deliverer: Heb. saviour</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. <note>came: Heb. was</note><note>Mesopotamia: Heb. Aram</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab. <note>a Benjamite: or, the son of Jemini</note><note>lefthanded: Heb. shut of his right hand</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bore the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back at the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. <note>quarries: or, graven images</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from his seat. <note>a summer…: Heb. a parlour of cooling</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the handle also entered after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. <note>the dirt…: or, it came out at the buttocks</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. <note>covereth…: or, doeth his easement</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and permitted not a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all stout, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. <note>lusty: Heb. fat</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw to thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will surely go with thee: however the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon. <note>together: Heb. by cry, or, proclamation</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Arise; for this is the day when the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the LORD destroyed Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera came down from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. <note>a man: Heb. unto one</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. <note>mantle: or, rug, or, blanket</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.</verse>
