      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the hearts of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command thee what is befitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Who in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, my own heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that on my account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: although I do not say to thee that thou owest to me even thy own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But at the same time prepare for me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There greet thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellowlabourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. <note>Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</note></verse>
