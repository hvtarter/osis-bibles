      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>And whether we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. <note>is effectual: or, is wrought</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead: <note>sentence: or, answer</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that ye might have a second benefit; <note>benefit: or, grace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>When I therefore was thus minded, did I do it lightly? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. <note>word: or, preaching</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now he who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I have not as yet come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them by whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not burden you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted by many. <note>punishment: or, censure</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that on the contrary ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such an one should be swallowed up with too much sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ; <note>person: or, sight</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are to God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To the one we are the savour of death to death; and to the other the savour of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ. <note>corrupt: or, deal deceitfully with</note><note>in Christ: or, of Christ</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And such trust we have through Christ toward God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient by ourselves to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. <note>giveth life: or, quickeneth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministration of condemnation was glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: <note>plainness: or, boldness</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>And not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were blinded: for until this day the same veil remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Nevertheless when one shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <note>by the…: or, of the Lord the Spirit</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. <note>dishonesty: Gr. shame</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shone into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. <note>hath: Gr. is he who hath</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; <note>in despair: or, altogether without help, or, means</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>Knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace may through the thanksgiving of many abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our house which is from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not because we would be unclothed, but clothed, that mortality might be swallowed up in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he that hath wrought us for this very thing is God, who also hath given to us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted by him. <note>labour: or, endeavour</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he hath done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them who glory in appearance, and not in heart. <note>in appearance: Gr. in the face</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we are of sound mind, it is for your cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And that he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>Therefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh: though indeed, we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth we know him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. <note>he is: or, let him be</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are from God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>That is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. <note>committed…: Gr. put in us</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>But in all things commending ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, <note>approving: Gr. commending</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; <note>in tumults: or, in tossings to and fro</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>By honour and dishonour, by bad report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O ye Corinthians, We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>Ye are not restrained by us, but ye are restrained by your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now in return for the same, (I speak as to my children,) open wide your hearts to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And I will be a Father to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying concerning you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it was but for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might suffer loss through us in nothing. <note>after…: or, according to God</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold this very same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what diligence it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what avenging of wrong! In all things ye have proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Therefore, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if I have boasted any thing to him concerning you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found to be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. <note>inward…: Gr. bowels</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. <note>liberality: Gr. simplicity</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For to their power, I bear witness, and even beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>Begging us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So that we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. <note>grace: or, gift</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago. <note>forward: Gr. willing</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>Now therefore finish the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I mean not that other men should be eased, and you burdened:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more diligent, of his own accord he went to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not that only, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to show our ready mind: <note>grace: or, gift</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. <note>I have: or, he hath</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If any do enquire concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For as concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know the readiness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath stirred up very many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, of which ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of covetousness. <note>bounty: Gr. blessing</note><note>whereof…: or, which hath been so much spoken of before</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this I say, He who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he who soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or by necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>(As it is written, He hath dispersed; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now may he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. <note>bountifulness: or, liberality: Gr. simplicity</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>While by the proof of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>And by their prayer for you, who long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: <note>in presence: or, in outward appearance</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. <note>think: or, reckon</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) <note>through God: or, to God</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; <note>imaginations: or, reasonings</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And having in a readiness to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trusteth to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. <note>say they: Gr. saith he</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. <note>are…: or, understand it not</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you. <note>rule: or, line</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, <note>enlarged…: or, magnified in you</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand. <note>line: or, rule</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>O that ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. <note>indeed bear…: or, indeed ye do bear with me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his craftiness, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. <note>with him: or, with me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I suppose I was not a bit behind the very greatest apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But though I am rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made evident among you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God without charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And when I was present with you, and in need, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. <note>no man…: Gr. this boasting shall not be stopped in me</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? because I love you not? God knoweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. <note>receive: or, suffer</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>That which I speak, I speak it not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For ye bear with fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For ye bear with it, if a man bringeth you into bondage, if a man devoureth you, if a man taketh from you, if a man exalteth himself, if a man smiteth you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatever respect any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or what he heareth from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very greatest apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you, and I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and immorality and licentiousness which they have committed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. <note>perfection: or, reformation, or, restoration</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</verse>
