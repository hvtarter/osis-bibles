The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Matt'>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was resolved to divorce her quietly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, »Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>»Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,and they shall call his name Immanuel,«which means, »God with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but did not know her until she had borne a son. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, »Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;for out of you shall come a rulerwho will be the shepherd of my people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>»A voice was heard in Ramah,lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, »The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John wore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bear fruit worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter came and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone,but by every word that proceedsfrom the mouth of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, He will give his angels charge of you,and In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your Godand him only shall you serve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>»The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light,and on those who sat in the region and shadow of deathlight has dawned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>»Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are those who mourn,for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek,for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful,for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart,for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers,for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>»You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>»Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>»You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be answerable to the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.3'>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.4'>Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.5'>These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: »Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.6'>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.7'>And preach as you go, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.8'>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.9'>Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.10'>nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.11'>Now whatever village or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.12'>As you enter the house, give it your greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.13'>And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.14'>And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.15'>Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.16'>»Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.17'>But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.18'>You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.19'>But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.20'>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.21'>Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.22'>And you will be hated by all for my names sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.23'>When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.24'>»A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.25'>It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.26'>»So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.27'>What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.28'>And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.29'>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Fathers will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.30'>But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.31'>Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.32'>»Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.33'>But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.34'>»Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.35'>For I have come to set a man against his father,and a daughter against her mother,and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.36'>and a mans enemies will be those of his own household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.37'>He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.38'>and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.39'>He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.40'>»He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.41'>He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophets reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.42'>And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.11'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.1'>And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.2'>Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.3'>and said to him, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.4'>And Jesus answered them, »Go and tell John what you hear and see:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.5'>the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.6'>And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.7'>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.8'>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.9'>Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.10'>For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.11'>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.12'>From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.13'>For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.14'>And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.15'>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.16'>»But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.17'>We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.18'>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.19'>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.20'>Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.21'>»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.22'>But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.23'>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades.For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.24'>But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.25'>At that time Jesus declared, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.26'>Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.27'>»All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.28'>Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.29'>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.30'>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.12'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.1'>At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.2'>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, »Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.3'>He said to them, »Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.4'>how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.5'>Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are innocent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.6'>I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.7'>And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.8'>For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.9'>And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.10'>And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?« so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.11'>He said to them, »What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.12'>Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.13'>Then he said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.14'>But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.15'>Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.16'>and ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.17'>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.18'>»Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased!I will put my Spirit upon him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.19'>He will not quarrel or cry out;nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.20'>A bruised reed he will not break,and a smoldering wick he will not quench,till he sends forth justice to victory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.21'>and in his name will the Gentiles hope.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.22'>Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.23'>And all the people were amazed and said, »Could this be the Son of David?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.24'>But when the Pharisees heard this they said, »It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.25'>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.26'>If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.27'>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.28'>But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.29'>Or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.30'>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.31'>Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.32'>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.33'>»Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.34'>You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.35'>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.36'>But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.37'>For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.38'>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.39'>But he answered them, »An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.40'>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.41'>The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.42'>The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.43'>»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.44'>Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.45'>Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.46'>While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.47'>Someone told him, »Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.48'>But he replied to the man who told him, »Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.49'>And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.50'>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.13'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.1'>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.2'>And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.3'>Then he told them many things in parables, saying: »A sower went out to sow his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.4'>And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.6'>But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>He who has ears, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>The disciples came and said to him, »Why do you speak to them in parables?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.11'>And he answered them, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.12'>For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: Hearing you will hear and shall not understand;and seeing you will see and not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.15'>For this peoples heart has grown dull.And their ears are hard of hearing,and their eyes they have closed,lest they should see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and they understand with their hearts,and turn so that I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>»Hear then the parable of the sower:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.20'>But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.21'>yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.26'>So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.27'>And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.28'>He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>But he said, No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>He told them another parable: »The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: »I will open my mouth in parables,I will utter things hiddensince the foundation of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, »Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>He answered, »He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.46'>who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>which, when it was full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.50'>and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.51'>Jesus asked, »Have you understood all these things?« »Yes,« they said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.52'>And he said to them, »Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, »Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.55'>Is this not the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.56'>And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.58'>And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.1'>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>because John had said to him, »It is not lawful for you to have her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herods birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>Prompted by her mother, she said, »Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>He said, »Bring them here to me,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.15'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.1'>Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.2'>»Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.8'>These people honor me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.9'>In vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.11'>not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.14'>Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.17'>Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.25'>But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>»Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.34'>And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.35'>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.37'>And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.38'>Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.39'>And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.3'>And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.« So he left them and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.5'>When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>Then Jesus said to them, »Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>And they discussed among themselves, saying, »It is because we have taken no bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But Jesus, aware of this, said, »O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.10'>Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.11'>How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.13'>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.14'>And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.15'>He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.18'>And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.19'>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.20'>Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.21'>From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.22'>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.23'>But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.24'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.25'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.2'>And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.6'>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.12'>But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.14'>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.20'>So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.21'/>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.22'>Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, »The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>and to them he said, You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why have you been standing here idle all day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.8'>And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, »May no fruit ever come from you again!« And immediately the fig tree withered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>And Jesus answered them, »Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, »By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>Then he went to the second and said the same thing. And he answered, I go, sir, but he did not go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.40'>And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>»You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, »Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, »Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, »What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?« And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said, »Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And as they were eating, he said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, »Is it I, Lord?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered, »He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, »Rabbi, is it I?« He said to him, »You have said it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, »Take, eat; this is my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, »Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter declared to him, »Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, »Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, »Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.« And so said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, »My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, »O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, »So, could you not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, »O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>So he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, »The one I kiss is the man; seize him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And at once he went up to Jesus and said, »Greetings, Rabbi!« and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, »Friend, why are you here?« Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>But Jesus said to him, »Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.« Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, »This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest stood up and said, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, »I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, »It is as you said. But I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power,and coming on the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, »He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?« They answered, »He is worthy of death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists; and others slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, »Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, »You also were with Jesus of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, »I do not know what you are talking about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to the people there, »This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>But again he denied it with an oath, »I do not know the man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, »Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know the man.« And immediately the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said, »Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.« So he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And they bound him, and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, »I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.« And they said, »What is that to us? You see to it!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, »It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the money of blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>So they took counsel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, »And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potters field, as the Lord directed me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, »Are you the king of the Jews?« So Jesus said to him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, »Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, »Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, »Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor answered them, »Which of the two do you want me to release to you?« They said, »Barabbas!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, »Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?« They all said, »Let him be crucified!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And he said, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Let him be crucified!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, »I am innocent of this mans blood. See to it yourselves.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered, »His blood be on us and on our children!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>and sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up over his head the charge written against him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, »You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>»He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, I am the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« that is, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, »This man is calling Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, »Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified, and said, »Truly this was the Son of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many women were also there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>When Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>and said, »Sir, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore order that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, »You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel said to the women, »Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold, Jesus met them and said, »Hail!« And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, »Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and there they will see me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>and said, »Tell them, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this comes to the governors ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and said to them, »All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«</verse>
