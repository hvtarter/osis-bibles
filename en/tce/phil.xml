The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always making my prayer with joy in every prayer of mine for you all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>For I am confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this is my prayer, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>so that you may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Now I want you to know, brethren, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my imprisonment for Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have been encouraged to speak the word of God without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, but thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>in no way frightened by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction to them, but of salvation for you  and that too, from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, though he was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to deatheven death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without grumbling or arguing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>I have no one else like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know that he has proved his worth, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>for he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor men like him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those mutilators of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But whatever was gain to me, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>More than that, I count everything to be loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let those of us who are mature have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>But our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my brethren, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, and I ask you also, true yoke-fellow, to help these women who have struggled at my side in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you had no opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be in need, and I also know how to have plenty; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the first preaching of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>for even in Thessalonica you sent me a gift once and again for my needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
