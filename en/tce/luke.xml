The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty of the things which you have been taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zechariah said to the angel, »How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered him, »I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when his time of service was completed, he went to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>»Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel went to her and said, »Hail, O highly favored one, the Lord is with you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was greatly troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, »Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel, »How can this be, since I am a virgin?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered her, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing will be impossible.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, »Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.« And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she exclaimed with a loud voice, »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>»My soul magnifies the Lord,and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>for he has regarded the lowly state of his servant;for behold, henceforth all generationswill call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he who is mighty has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on those who fear himfrom generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with his arm;he has scattered the proudin the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down the mighty from their thrones,and exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things,and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel,in remembrance of his mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his seed forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>but his mother said, »No; he shall be called John.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, »There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, »What then will this child be?« For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>»Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that we should be saved from our enemiesand from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to grant us that we,being delivered from the hand of our enemies,might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before himall the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to his peoplein the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God,with which the sunrise from on high will visit us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darknessand in the shadow of death,to guide our feet into the way of peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And in that region there were shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>Then the angel said to them, »Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be a sign to you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>»Glory to God in the highest,and on earth peace among menwith whom he is pleased!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>Now when they had seen him, they made widely known the saying which had been told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, »Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord«),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, »a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him up in his arms and blessed God, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>»Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,according to your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen your salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation to the Gentiles,and for glory to your people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, »Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, but worshipped with fasting and prayer night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when the feast was over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, »Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, »Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, »The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filledand every mountain and hill brought low;the crooked places shall be made straightand the rough ways smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the multitudes asked him, »What then shall we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answered them, »He who has two tunics, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, »Teacher, what shall we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, »Collect no more than is appointed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Likewise the soldiers asked him, »And what shall we do?« So he said to them, »Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered them all, »I baptize you with water; but one mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>And with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the other evil things Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also baptized. And as he was praying, the heaven was opened</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>being tempted for forty days by the devil. In those days he ate nothing, and when they had ended, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>And the devil said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>But Jesus answered him, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>Then the devil took him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And he said to him, »To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered him, »It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God,and him only shall you serve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>He took him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>for it is written: He will give his angels charge of you,to guard you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>and, In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>And Jesus answered him, »It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>When the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of him went out through all the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>»The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,because he has anointed meto preach the good news to the poor.He has sent me to proclaim release to the captivesand recovery of sight to the blind,to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>Then he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And he began to say to them, »Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, »Is not this Joseph's son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>He said to them, »Surely you will quote this proverb to me: Physician, heal yourself! Do here also in your own country what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>Then he said, »Truly, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But I tell you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>but Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>And they rose up and cast him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down the cliff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But passing through the midst of them, he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>»Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!« And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all amazed and said to one another, »What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now Simons mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they made request of him on her behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she rose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also came out of many, crying, »You are the Son of God!« But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>Now when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted place. And the people sought him and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but he said to them, »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this purpose.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now as the people pressed around him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, »Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answered, »Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, »Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, »Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>So when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he charged him to tell no one, »But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report went around concerning him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>When they could not find a way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>When he saw their faith he said, »Man, your sins are forgiven you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, »Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, »Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the man who was paralyzed »I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, »We have seen strange things today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And he left everything, rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Then Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there were a great number of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes complained against his disciples, saying, »Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>They said to him, »The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And Jesus said to them, »Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He told them a parable also: »No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one after drinking old wine desires the new; for he says, The old is better.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grain fields, and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said, »Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered them, »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered the house of God, took and ate the consecrated bread, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And he said to them, »The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him closely, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, »Rise and stand here.« And he rose and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, »I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And he looked around at them all, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He did so, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>In those days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>And when it was day, he called his disciples to himself; and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and be healed of their diseases,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came from him and healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>He lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: »Blessed are you poor,for yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.31'>And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.32'>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.34'>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.35'>But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For he is kind to the ungrateful and evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.39'>He also told them a parable: »Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.40'>A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.41'>And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the plank from out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.43'>»For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.44'>For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it was well built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>When he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>A centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>When he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, »He is worthy to have you do this for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and has built us our synagogue.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, »Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard this, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that followed him, »I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon afterward, he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, »Do not weep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Then he came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And he said, »Young man, I say to you, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>The dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, »A great prophet has arisen among us;« and »God has visited his people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and all the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>Then the disciples of John told him about all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that very hour he cured many of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>He answered them, »Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went to the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and as she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, »If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answered him, »Simon, I have something to say to you.« And he said, »Teacher, say it.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Soon afterward, he went on through every city and village, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>»A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.« When he had said this he called out, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>When his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>he said, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others it is given in parables, so that Seeing they may not see,and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>»Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And the ones that fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>»No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he said to them, »My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side of the lake.« So they set out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they went and woke him, saying, »Master, Master, we are perishing!« Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to them, »Where is your faith?« And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he said, »Legion«; because many demons had entered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>»Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you.« And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the people pressed round him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, »Who touched me?« When all denied it, Peter said, »Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, »Someone touched me; for I know that power has gone out from me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, »Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus on hearing this answered him, »Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>Now all were wailing and mourning for her; but he said, »Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took her by the hand and called, saying, »Child, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, »Take nothing for the journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, »John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?« So he sought to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had done. Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, »Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a deserted place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said, »We have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, »Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>They all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him; and he asked them, »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>So they answered, »John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>And he said to them, »But who do you say that I am?« And Peter answered, »The Christ of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, »The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Then he said to them all, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe became white and glistening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, »Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah«not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, »This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, »Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him, bruising him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>»Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>Now John answered, »Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, »Do not forbid him, for he that is not against you is for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>but the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they were going along the road, a man said to him, »I will follow you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>To another he said, »Follow me.« But he said, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, »Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Still another said, »I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus said to him, »No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>He said to them, »You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.16'>The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.18'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>Then he told them a parable, to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>He said: »In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Grant me justice against my adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, »Hear what the unjust judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God bring about justice for his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>»Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other menextortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to him and said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>Now a certain ruler asked him, »Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>So Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, »All these I have kept from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>When Jesus heard it, he said to him, »One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>Jesus looked at him and said, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>Those who heard it said, »Then who can be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But he said, »What is impossible with men is possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, »Behold, we have left all and followed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>So he said to them, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, »Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>They will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>They told him, »Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he cried out, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>So Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>»What do you want me to do for you?« He said, »Lord, I want to receive my sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jesus said to him, »Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>And when they saw it they all murmured, »He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, »Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, »Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As they heard these things, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore he said: »A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>So he called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then came the first, saying,  Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, be in authority over ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas already!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>When he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, »Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>If any one asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say to him, The Lord has need of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, »Why are you untying the colt?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, »The Lord has need of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he went along, many spread their garments on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying, »Blessed is the Kingwho comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He answered, »I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones would cry out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, »If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, »It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer;but you have made it a den of robbers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and said to him, »Tell us by what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is that gave you this authority.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answered them, »I also will ask you a question; now tell me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he began to tell the people this parable: »A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-dressers, and went into another country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>He sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>He sent a third; and they wounded him and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves and said, This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others.« When they heard this, they said, »May this never be!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he looked at them and said, »What then is this that is written: The stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the peoplefor they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might catch him on what he said, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, »Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>»Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>He said to them, »Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said. But marveling at his answer they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>and they questioned him, »Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and then the third took her, and in the same way the seven died, and they left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Finally the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus said to them, »The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the scribes answered, »Teacher, you have spoken well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, »How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord,»Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>till I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>»Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and officers, how he might betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>So he sent Peter and John, saying, »Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he withdrew from them about a stones throw, and knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>»Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>An angel appeared to him from heaven, and strengthened him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>When he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>He said to them, »Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And a little later some one else saw him and said, »You also are of them.« But Peter said, »Man, I am not!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>Then after about an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, »Certainly this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, »Man, I do not know what you are saying!« Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, »Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They blindfolded him and asked him, »Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they spoke many other things against him, blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council chamber, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them, »If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>And if I ask you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>So Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« He answered him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, »I find no crime in this man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were urgent, saying, »He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee to this place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned him with many words, but he gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, dressing him in a gorgeous robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, »You have brought this man to me as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. And behold, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed to them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they shouted, »Crucify him, crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Then he said to them the third time, »Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people followed him, and women who also mourned and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning to them said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains,Fall on us!and to the hills,Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then Jesus said, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.« And they divided his garments and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, »He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him wine vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, »If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was also an inscription written over him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him, saying, »Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other rebuked him, saying, »Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>for the sun was darkened; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, »Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.« And having said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, »Certainly this was a righteous man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts, and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>who had not consented to their decision and deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.57'>And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, »What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk?« And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, »Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, »What things?« And they said to him, »The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all this happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>In addition, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them, »O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>As they drew near the village to which they were going, he acted as though he would be going farther,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>but they constrained him, saying, »Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.« So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to each other, »Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, »The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, »Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, »Have you anything here to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took it and ate in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then he said to them, »These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And he said to them, »Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple praising God.</verse>
