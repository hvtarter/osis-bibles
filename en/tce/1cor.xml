The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you eagerly wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For I have been informed by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you, my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>What I mean is this, that each one of you says, »I am of Paul,« and »I of Apollos,« and »I of Cephas,« and »I of Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospelnot with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, »I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the cleverness of the clever I will frustrate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no flesh may boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>therefore, as it is written, »Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>so that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Yet we do speak a wisdom among the mature, a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and which God destined for our glory before the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this age understood it; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But, as it is written, »No eye has seen, nor ear heard,nor the heart of man conceivedwhat God has prepared for those who love him,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>God has revealed them to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit which is in him? Even so no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand the things freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>»For who has known the mind of the Lordthat he may instruct him?« But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as carnal men, as infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk, not solid food; for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, even now you are not ready,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking like mere men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, »I am of Paul,« and another, »I am of Apollos,« are you not mere men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord assigned to each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each mans work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man's work which he has built on it survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are God's temple and that Gods Spirit dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For Gods temple is holy, and that temple you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, »He catches the wise in their own craftiness«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, »The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,that they are futile.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future; all belong to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by any human court; I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted by this. It is the Lord who judges me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts. Then every man will receive his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in favor of one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who regards you as different? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already filled! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! And indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all, like men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and we are poorly clothed, and roughly treated, and homeless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write this to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the words of these arrogant people, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: a man has his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to have mourned? Let the one who has done this be removed from your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this, as if I were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not at all meaning the immoral people of this world, or with the greedy and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is an immoral person, or greedy, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindlernot even to eat with such a one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>God judges those outside. »Expel the wicked man from among you.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>When any one of you has a grievance against a brother, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>So if you have disputes about such matters, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Instead, you yourselves defraud and do wrong, and you even do this to your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because of immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>I say this by way of concession, not of command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish that all men were as I myself am. But each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him do so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Each one should remain in the state in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it trouble youbut if you can gain your freedom, do so.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have troubles in this flesh, and I am trying to spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; so that from now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those who mourn, as though they were not mourning; and those who rejoice, as though they were not rejoicing; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it. For the form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>but a married man is concerned about the affairs of the world, how he may please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman is concerned about the affairs of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is good and to secure undivided devotion to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward his betrothed, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has control over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols, eat food as really sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>But food will not commend us to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you may have been moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, »Jesus be cursed,« and no one can say, »Jesus is Lord,« except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are varieties of service, but the same Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>There are varieties of working, but the same God who works all of them in all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another distinguishing between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as he wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so it is with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one bodywhether Jews or Greeks, slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For the body is not made up of one member but of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot should say, »Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear should say, »Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has arranged the members in the body, each one of them, just as he desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>If they were all one member, where would the body be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you,« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>while our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then those having gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and those speaking in various kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>If I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>If I give all I have to the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous or boastful, it is not arrogant</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>or rude, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it keeps no record of wrongs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>it does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails; but where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fullyeven as I have been fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>So now faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands him, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and encouragement and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>If even lifeless things, such as the flute or the harp, do not give a distinction in the notes, how will any one know what is played?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So it is with you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible, how will anyone know what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So it is with you; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the »Amen« to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in thinking be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, »By men of strange tonguesand by the lips of foreignerswill I speak to this people,and even then they will not listen to me,says the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; but prophecy is for believers, not for unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, he will fall on his face, and worship God, declaring that God is really among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is the outcome then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn; and one must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting, the first one must keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as even the law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But all things should be done decently and in an orderly way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I would remind you, brethren, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of themyet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>More than that, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then, at his coming, those who belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>»For God has put all things in subjection under his feet.« But when it says, »All things are put in subjection under him,« it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are people baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, »Let us eat and drink,for tomorrow we die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived: »Bad company corrupts good morals.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will ask, »How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>For not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised imperishable;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>So it is written, »The first man Adam became a living being«; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was from the earth, of dust; the second man is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now I tell you this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written: »Death is swallowed up in victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>»O death, where is your victory?O death, where is your sting?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
