The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Col'>
      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: grace to you and peace from God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which has come to you, just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, even as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this reason also, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>so that you will live a life worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesall things were created through him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might have the first place in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell in him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and through him, to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And although you were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshly body through death, in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share for the sake of his body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>Of this church I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To them God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>We proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>For this end I labor, striving with all his energy, which so mightily works within me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I want you to know how greatly I strive for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be encouraged as they are knit together in love, to have all the riches of assured understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>I say this so that no one may delude you with fine-sounding arguments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For even though I am absent in flesh, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so live in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and you have been made complete in him, who is the head over all rule and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having canceled the certificate of debt, which stood against us with its decrees. He took what was hostile away from us, nailing it to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Therefore let no one judge you in questions of food or drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>These things are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one disqualify you for the prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If with Christ you died to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you still belonged to it, do you submit to regulations such as,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>»Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>(referring to things which are all destined perish with use), according to human commandments and teachings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your minds on the things above, not on things that are on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>In these you once walked, when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>Here there is no Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free, but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>So, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord forgave you, so you also must forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they will become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Slaves, in everything obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>For he who does wrong will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>And pray for us as well, that God may open a door to us for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>so that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech always be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus will tell you all about my affairs. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>and with him Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you everything that has taken place here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, and also Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you have received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and also Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved to be a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of your number, a servant of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>When this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>Say to Archippus, »See to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</verse>
