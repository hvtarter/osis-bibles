The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostlesent not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is really not another gospel; but there are some who are disturbing you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, so I say again now, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace, was pleased</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I do not lie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>they only heard it said, »He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God because of me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>I went up because of a revelation; and I set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who were of reputation, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>We did not yield to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>And from those who were reputed to be something (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)those, I say, who were of repute added nothing to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for he who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separate himself, fearing the party of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, »If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>»We ourselves, who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>yet who know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of the law, because by works of the law will no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died for nothing.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Did you suffer so many things in vainif it really was in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even so Abraham »believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, »In you will all the nations be blessed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to do them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, »The righteous man shall live by faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, »He who does them shall live by them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for usfor it is written, »Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>To give a human example, brethren: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, »And to seeds,« as referring to many, but rather to one, »And to your seed,« that is, Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>What I mean is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator does not represent just one party; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have come by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin, so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>Now before faith came, we were bound under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of all the estate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the elemental things of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, »Abba! Father!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You observe days and months and seasons and years!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or scorn me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They seek you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, so that you may seek them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is always good to seek a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave and one by the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, »Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;break forth and shout, you who are not in labor;for the children of the desolate are more numerousthan the children of her who has a husband.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now you, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the scripture say? »Cast out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>It was for freedom that Christ has set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion did not come from him who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine; and the one who is troubling you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But if I, brethren, still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, lewdness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, even if anyone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each one test his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each one will bear his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let the one who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but what counts is a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
