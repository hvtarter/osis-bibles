The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='2Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>This is evidence of God's righteous judgment, so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believedbecause our testimony to you was believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>To this end we always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and may fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we beg you, brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are to perish, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>For this reason God sends upon them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>He called you to this through our gospel, that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it did also with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not according to the tradition which you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves an example for you to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: »If anyone will not work, he shall not eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, not doing any work at all, but acting like busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and earn their own bread to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
