The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all in Rome who are beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have some harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, »The just shall live by faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>for what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen, being understood by the things that have been made. So they are without excuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge another; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Do you think, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do the same yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But by your hardness and your impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>For he »will render to each one according to his works«:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who by patience in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>on that day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will and approve of what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For, as it is written, »The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a breaker of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something outward and in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, and not by the written code. His praise is not from men but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>Then what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way! To begin with, they are entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>What if some did not have faith? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Certainly not! Let God be true, though every man a liar. As it is written: »That you may be justified in your wordsand prevail when you are judged.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Certainly not! For then how could God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Why not say  as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say»Let us do evil that good may come«? Their condemnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we Jews any better off? Certainly not; for we have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written: »There is none righteous, no, not one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>there is no one who understands,no one who seeks for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All have turned aside, together they have become worthless;there is no one who does good,not even one.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>»Their throat is an open grave;they use their tongues to practice deceit.«»The poison of asps is under their lips.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>»Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>»Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>in their ways are ruin and misery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and the way of peace they do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>»There is no fear of God before their eyes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore no flesh will be justified in his sight by works of the law, for through the law comes knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no difference,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God put forward as an atoning sacrifice by his blood, to be received through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins committed beforehand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>and it was to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then is our boasting? It is excluded. On what law? On the law of works? No, but on the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since there is one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the scripture say? »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>So also David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>»Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,and whose sins are covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>blessed is the man against whom the Lordwill not reckon his sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessedness only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it reckoned to him? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of the law are to be the heirs, faith has no value and the promise is void,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>because the law brings wrath, for where there is no law there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all his descendantsnot only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(as it is written, »I have made you the father of many nations«) in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>In hope, he believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he had been told, »So shall your descendants be.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>That is why it was »reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>But the words, »it was reckoned to him,« were written not for his sake alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for us also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and perseverance, character; and character, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>When we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Why, one will hardly die for a righteous manthough perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all men, because all men sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man's trespass many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>So then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Law came in, that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who has died has been freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey its passions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>and, having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I am speaking in human terms, because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its end, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Do you not know, brethrenfor I am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now, by dying to what once held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, »You shall not covet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. For apart from the law sin lies dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>I do not understand what I do. For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>So then, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For I do not do the good I want to do; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see in my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weakened through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin: he condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, »Abba, Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>And those whom he predestined, he also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>As it is written: »For your sake we are being killed all the day long;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>Of them are the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, forever blessed. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>In other words, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>For this is what the promise said: »About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our father Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>though the twins were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might stand, not because of works but because of his call,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>she was told, »The older will serve the younger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>As it is written, »Jacob I loved,but Esau I hated.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>For he says to Moses, »I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,and I will have compassionon whom I have compassion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>So it depends not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, »I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I may show my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens the heart of whom he wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>You will say to me then, »Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him who formed it, »Why have you made me like this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Does not the potter have right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>What if God, choosing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As indeed he says in Hosea: »I will call them who were not my people my people,and her who was not beloved I will call my beloved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>»And it will happen that in the very placewhere it was said to them, You are not my people,they will be called sons of the living God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: »Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>For the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth with speed and finality.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>And as Isaiah said: »Unless the Lord of hosts had left us children,we would have become like Sodom,and we would have been made like Gomorrah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>but Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, has not attained that law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>as it is written: »Behold, I lay in Zion a stone that will make men stumble,and a rock that will make them fall;and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the law, that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, »The man who does those things shall live by them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness based on faith says, »Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?« (that is, to bring Christ down)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or »Who will descend into the abyss?« (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? »The word is near you,in your mouth and in your heart« (that is, the word of faith which we preach);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his mouth and so is saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>The scripture says, »No one who believes in him will be put to shame.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches on all who call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For, »everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, »How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, »Lord, who has believed our message?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for »Their voice has gone out to all the earth,and their words to the ends of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, »I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;by a foolish nation I will make you angry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But Isaiah is very bold and says, »I was found by those who did not seek me;I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But of Israel he says, »All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>»Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what is God's reply to him? »I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? Israel did not obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>as it is written: »God gave them a spirit of stupor,eyes that they should not seeand ears that they should not hear,down to this very day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David says: »Let their table become a snare and a trap,a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,and bend their backs forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? Certainly not! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say then, »Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only by faith. So do not be proud, but stand in awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: »The Deliverer will come from Zion,he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>and this will be my covenant with themwhen I take away their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has bound all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>»For who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has been his counselor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>»Or who has given a gift to himthat he might be repaid?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>if service, let us use it in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in showing honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>Never be lacking in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be faithful in prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Repay no one evil for evil, but have regard for what is noble in the sight of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, »Vengeance is mine, I will repay,« says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>No, »if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Therefore he who resists the authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will have praise from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is Gods servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's ministers, attending to this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Pay all of them their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>The commandments, »You shall not commit adultery,« »You shall not murder,« »You shall not steal,« »You shall not covet,« and any other commandment there may be, are summed up in this sentence, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And do this, knowing the hour, that now it is full time for you to wake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in quarreling and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>As for the man who is weak in faith, accept him, but not for disputes over opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One believes he may eat anything, but the man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him who eats despise him who does not, and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will be made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written: »As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,and every tongue shall confess to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brothers way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, »The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ also welcomed you, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised to show God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: »Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,and sing to your name«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>and again it says: »Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>and again, »Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,and praise him, all you peoples«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Isaiah says: »There shall be a root of Jesse;and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles,in him the Gentiles shall hope.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but as it is written: »They shall see who have not been told of him,and those who have not heard shall understand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, since I no longer have any place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy, and together with you be refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.33'>The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
