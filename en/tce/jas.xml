The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Jas'>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>for you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But he must ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like the flower of the grass he will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and its beauty is destroyed. So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one say when he is tempted, »I am being tempted by God«; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not tempt anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is full-grown, it brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>for he looks at himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what he was like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But one who looks intently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer that acts, this man will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, show no favoritism as you hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say, »Have a seat here in a good place,« and you say to the poor man, »You stand there,« or, »Sit by my feet,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brethren: has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you have been called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If you really fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself,« you are doing well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he who said, »Do not commit adultery,« said also, »Do not murder.« If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment will be without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What good is it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has no works? Can such faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you says to them, »Go in peace, be warmed and filled,« and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But someone will say, »You have faith and I have works.« Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeand shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You see that faith was working with his works, and faith was completed by works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>and the scripture was fulfilled which says, »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness«, and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>In the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire, a world of evil among the members of the body. The tongue corrupts our whole person, sets the whole course of our life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show his deeds in the humility of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>What causes quarrels and fights among you? Is it not your passions that are at war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason: »He jealously desires the Spirit which he has made to dwell in us«?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, »God opposes the proud,but gives grace to the humble.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But youwho are you to judge your neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, you who say, »Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>Yet you do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead, you ought to say, »If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out against you; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we call those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>and the prayer offered in faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>Then he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
