The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='1Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my true child in the faith: grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than the divine trainingwhich is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>For some men have wandered away from these things and turned aside to fruitless discussion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor, I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>and the grace of our Lord was overflowing for me, with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>It is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom I am the foremost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>I give you this command, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies once made about you, that by them you may fight the good fight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and made shipwreck of their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself as a ransom for allthe testimony given at the proper time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or quarreling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>I also want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and sensibly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>But women will be saved through the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-restraint.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>It is a trustworthy saying: if any one aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>He must manage his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(If a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall into the same condemnation as the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, and not fond of sordid gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>They must also first be tested; and then if they are beyond reproach, let them serve as deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>The women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Deacons must be the husband of one wife, and must manage their children and their households well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those who have served well as deacons gain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>if I am delayed, you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: he was revealed in the flesh,was vindicated in the Spirit,seen by angels,preached among the nations,believed on in the world,taken up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>through the pretensions of liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you point out these things to the brethren, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself in godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily training is of some value, but godliness is of value in all things, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>It is a trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Command and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one look down on your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you through prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that all may see your progress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in them, for if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice their religion in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she who is a real widow, and who has been left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Command these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>and she must be well known for her good deeds, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved those in distress, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>thus bringing condemnation, because they have set aside their first pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>Besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture says, »You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,« and, »The laborer deserves his wages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The sins of some men are obvious, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins appear later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but they must serve them all the better, because those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produce envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a means of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is itself great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which he will bring about at the proper timehe who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with everything to enjoy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous and ready to share,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that life which is life indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you.</verse>
