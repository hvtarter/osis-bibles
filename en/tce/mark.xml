The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: »Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>»The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord;make his paths straight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the land of Judea, and the people from Jerusalem, went out to him and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying, »After me comes One who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, »The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, »Come follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>When he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, »Let us alone! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, »What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Now at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>Now in the morning, a long while before daylight, he rose and went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and when they found him, they said to him, »Everyone is looking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said to them, »Let us go on to the next towns, so I may preach there also; for that is why I have come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>Then a leper came to him, imploring him, kneeling down to him and saying to him, »If you are willing, you can make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him, and said to him, »I am willing; be clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he strictly warned him and sent him away at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and he said to him, »See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And when he entered Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And he preached the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Then they came to him, bringing a paralytic carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above him; and when they had broken through, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, »Son, your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>»Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, he said to them, »Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your pallet and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>»I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, »We never saw anything like this!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Then he went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And as he sat at table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, »Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>»No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, »Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>But he said to them, »Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him closely, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man who had the withered hand, »Come here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he said to them, »Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?« But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things he was doing, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, »You are the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those he himself wanted. And they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>Then he appointed twelve, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cast out the demons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, »Sons of Thunder«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, »He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>So he called them to himself and said to them in parables: »How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, »He has an unclean spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside they sent to him, and called him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, »Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he replied, »Who are my mother and my brothers?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him, and said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Again he began to teach by the sea. and a very large crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>Then he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>»Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And as he sowed the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, »To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that seeing they may see but not perceive,and hearing may hear but not understand;lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, »Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>But these are the ones sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, »Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>Then he said to them, »Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does not have, from him even what he has will be taken away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, »The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>All by itself the earth produces grainfirst the blade, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, »With what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But he was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they woke him and said to him, »Teacher, do you not care if we perish?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, »Peace! Be still!« And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>He said to them, »Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, »Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for he had often been bound with shackles and chains. But the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And crying out with a loud voice, he said, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he had said to him, »Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Then Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he replied, »My name is Legion, for we are many.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So all the demons begged him, »Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>So those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>Jesus did not let him, but said, »Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, »My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>So Jesus went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and she had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she owned, and was no better but rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, »If I touch even his clothes, I shall be made well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the bleeding stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, »Who touched my clothes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, »You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, Who touched me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, »Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, »Do not be afraid; only believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he came in, he said to them, »Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed at him. But after he put them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>He took her by the hand and said to her, »Talitha cumi!« which means, »Little girl, I say to you, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Immediately the girl stood up and walked (she was twelve years of age). And they were overcome with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>He went away from there and came to his own country, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, »Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« And they took offense at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marveled because of their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staffno bag, no bread, no money in their belts</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, »Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>So they went out and preached that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, »John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others said, »It is Elijah.« And others said, »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard, he said, »This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had said to Herod, »It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, »Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he vowed to her, »Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>So she went out and said to her mother, »What shall I ask?« And she said, »The head of John the Baptist!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, »I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, »Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while.« For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, »This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said to him, »Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>But he said to them, »How many loaves do you have? Go and see.« And when they found out they said, »Five, and two fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all ate and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were completely amazed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they had not understood about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and ran about that whole region, and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>they saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. And there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. )</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, »Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>And he said to them, »Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written: This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>In vain they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them, »You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift devoted to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And he called all the people to him again, and said to them, »Hear me, everyone, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'/>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>So he said to them, »Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>since it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?« (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And he said, »What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>coveting, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>And he said to her, »Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answered him, »Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then he said to her, »For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>She went home, and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him, »Ephphatha,« that is, »Be opened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, »He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>»I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, »How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>They ate, and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>he immediately got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, »Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he cautioned them, saying, »Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they discussed it with one another, saying, »It is because we have no bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Being aware of it, Jesus said to them, »Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?« They said to him, »Twelve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>»And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of pieces did you take up?« And they said, »Seven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He said to them, »Do you not yet understand?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, he asked him »Do you see anything?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And he looked up and said, »I see men; but they look like trees, walking.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw everything clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him away to his home, saying, »Do not even go into the village.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They replied, »Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>And he asked them, »But who do you say that I am?« Peter answered him, »You are the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he charged them to tell no one about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>He spoke plainly about this. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, »Get behind me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>And he said to them, »Truly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his clothes became dazzling, exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth could bleach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, »This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>Then he said to them, »Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man, that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>Immediately, when they saw him, all the people were greatly amazed, and ran to him and greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked them, »What are you discussing with them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one of the crowd answered him, »Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they could not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>He answered him, »O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And Jesus asked his father, »How long has he been like this?« And he said, »From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him, »If you can, all things are possible to him who believes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, »I believe; help my unbelief!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, »You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And the spirit cried out, convulsed him terribly, and came out. And the boy was like a corpse; so that many of them said, »He is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, »Why could we not cast it out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>And he said to them, »This kind can only come out by prayer.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For he was teaching his disciples and said to them, »The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>And they came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, »What were you discussing on the road?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they kept silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And he sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, »If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And he took a little child, and put him in the midst of them. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>»Whoever receives one of these little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John said to him, »Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name and we forbade him, because he was not one of us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said, »Do not forbid him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For he who is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, will by no means lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>»Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, to the fire that shall never be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'/>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'/>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>For every one will be salted with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Then he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom was, he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>He answered them, »What did Moses command you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said, »Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>But Jesus said to them, »Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.8'>and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>In the house his disciples also asked him again about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>So he said to them, »Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, »Let the little children come to me; and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>And he took them in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, »Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>And Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>And he said to him, »Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, »You lack one thing; go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>But he fell sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, »Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, »Then who can be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them and said, »With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter began to say to him, »See, we have left everything and followed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.29'>Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>»Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, »Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>And they said to him, »Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your glory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus said to them, »You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>They said to him, »We are able.« So Jesus said to them, »You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>But Jesus called them to himself and said to them, »You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.48'>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.49'>So Jesus stopped and said, »Call him.« And they called the blind man, saying to him, »Take heart; rise, he is calling you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>And Jesus said to him, »What do you want me to do for you?« And the blind man said to him, »Master, let me receive my sight.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and he sat on it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple. And when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.12'>On the next day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>And he would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>And as he taught them, he said, »Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?But you have made it a den of robbers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.19'>When evening came, they went out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>Peter remembered and said to him, »Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>And Jesus answered them, »Have faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.23'>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.24'>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.25'>And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.26'/>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.27'>Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.28'>And they said to him, »By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.29'>Jesus said to them, »I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.30'>The baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men? Answer me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>And they reasoned among themselves, »If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>But if we say, From men«they feared the people, for all held that John was a real prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.« And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Then he began to speak to them in parables: »A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He still had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, They will respect my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those tenants said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>So they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not read this Scripture: The stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>this was the Lords doing,and it is marvelous in our eyes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they knew he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>When they came, they said to him, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and care about no man; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we pay them, or should we not?« But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, »Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius, and let me look at it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought one. And he said to them, »Whose likeness and inscription is this?« They said to him, »Caesar's.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>Jesus said to them, »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.« And they were amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him; and they asked him a question, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>»Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and he died; leaving behind no children. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>So the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, »Is not this why you are wrong, that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him, »Which commandment is the first of all?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, »The first is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to him, »You are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no other but he;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, »You are not far from the kingdom of God.« And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, »How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: The Lord said to my Lord:»Sit at my right handtill I put your enemies under your feet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>Therefore David himself calls him Lord; how is he then his son?« And the common people heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his teaching he said, »Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich put in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, »Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythingall she had to live on.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, »Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>»Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And Jesus began to say to them: »Take heed that no one deceives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>Many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly. And she broke the flask and poured it over his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, »Why was this ointment wasted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.« And they criticized her sharply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, »Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, »Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says, where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, »Is it I?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>He said to them, »It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the dish with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, »Take; this is my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.29'>Peter said to him, »Even if all fall away, I will not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>But he spoke more vehemently, »If I have to die with you, I will not deny you!« And they all said the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>They went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, »Sit here, while I pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>And he took Peter, James and John with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>And he said to them, »My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; stay here, and watch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>And he said, »Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Then he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, »Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>And when he came again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>Then he came the third time and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Rise, let us go; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, »The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, »Rabbi!« and he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>And they laid hands on him and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>And Jesus said to them, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then they all forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth around his body. And they seized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Then some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, »Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, »I am. And you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power,and coming with the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>The high priest tore his clothes and said, »Why do we need any more witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?« And they all condemned him as worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to beat him, and to say to him, »Prophesy!« And the guards received him with slaps in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, »You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, »I neither know nor understand what you mean.« And he went out into the gateway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, »This is one of them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again he denied it. And after a little while again those standing near said to Peter, »Surely you are one of them; for you are a Gallilean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know this man of whom you speak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, »Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.« And he broke down and wept.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Very early in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Then Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« And he answered him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate again asked him, »Have you no answer to make? See how many things they bring against you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus still made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And with the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate again said to them, »Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, »Crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to salute him, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him; and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they crucified him, they divided his garments,casting lots for themto determine what each man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of the charge written against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'/>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads, and saying, »Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the cross!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes, and said, »He saved others; he cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?«which means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, »Behold, he is calling Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink, saying, »Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, »Truly this man was the Son of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they asked each other, »Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, though it was very large, had been rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, »Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, »Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they will pick up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>Then they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied it. Amen.</verse>
