The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='2Pet'>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>By these he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and become partakers of the divine nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and to knowledge, self-control, and to self-control, perseverance, and to perseverance, godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brethren, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>so there will be an entrance richly provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>since I know that the putting aside of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And I will see to it that after my departure you will be able at any time to call these things to mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>for no prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from long ago their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desire and despise authority. Bold and willful, they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, though greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>They have eyes full of adultery, that never cease from sin; they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but he was rebuked for his own transgression by a donkeya beast without speechwho spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm; for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>It has happened to them according to the true proverb, »A dog turns back to its own vomit,« and, »A sow, after having washed, returns to wallowing in the mire.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This is now the second letter that I have written to you, beloved, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own lusts</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, »Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt with intense heat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, spotless and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>
