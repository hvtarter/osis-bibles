The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing that is ours in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I am bold enough in Christ to order you to do what is proper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for love's sake I rather appeal to yousince I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I would have been glad to keep him with me, so that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope through your prayers to be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
