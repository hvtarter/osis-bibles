The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='1Pet'>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen exiles in the Dispersion, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling with his blood: may grace and peace be yours in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, kept in heaven for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>as you obtain the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you inquired and searched carefully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober in spirit, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, »You shall be holy, for I am holy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your exile on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For, »All flesh is like grass,and all its glory like the flower of grass.The grass withers,and the flower falls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of the Lord stands forever.« And this is the word which was preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore, put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>for you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>As you come to him, the living Stonerejected by men but chosen and precious in the sight of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>For it stands in scripture: »Behold, I lay in Zion a stone,a cornerstone chosen and precious,and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>To you therefore who believe, this is precious, but for those who do not believe, »The very stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and, »A stone that causes men to stumbleand a rock that makes them fall;« they stumble because they disobey the wordas they were desstined to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God;once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in case they speak against you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the supreme authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a covering for evil; live as servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are overbearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For a man is approved if, mindful of God, he bears up under pain while suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you patiently endure? But if when you do right and suffer for it you patiently endure, you have favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>»He committed no sin,and no deceit was found in his mouth;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he uttered no threats, but he trusted himself to him who judges justly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>You wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>when they see your chaste and respectful behavior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Your adornment must not be merely outwardbraiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on fine clothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, and were submissive to their own husbands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children if you do what is right and are not frightened by any fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with honor as the weaker partner, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but give a blessing instead; for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For, »He who would love lifeand see good daysmust keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>He must turn away from evil and do good;he must seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteousand his ears are open to their prayer,but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>Who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>and keep a clear conscience, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who formerly did not obey, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>And corresponding to that, baptism now saves younot the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good consciencethrough the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For you have spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and lawless idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they abuse you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For this reason the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they might live in the spirit according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>The end of all things is near; therefore be clear minded and sober for your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Above all, hold unfailing your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of God's varied grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belongs the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may also be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a troublesome meddler;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And »if it is hard for the righteous to be saved,what will become of the godless man and the sinner?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>shepherd the flock of God that is under your care, serving as overseersnot under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>not as lording it over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise you that are younger men be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for »God opposes the proud,but gives grace to the humble.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren throughout the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>With the help of Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</verse>
