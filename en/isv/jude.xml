      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <title>The children of your chosen sister greet you.</title>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and yet a brother of James, to those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept safe by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Dear friends, although I was eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write to you and urge you to continue your vigorous defense of the faith that was passed down to the saints once and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For some people have slipped in among you unnoticed. They were written about long ago as being deserving of this condemnation because they are ungodly. They turn the grace of our God into uncontrollable lust and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>Now I want to remind you, even though you are fully aware of these things, that the Lord who once saved his people from the land of Egypt later destroyed those who did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>He has also held in eternal chains those angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their assigned place. They are held in deepest darkness for judgment on the great day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them, which like them committed sexual sins and engaged in homosexual activities, serve as an example of the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>In a similar way, these dreamers also defile their flesh, reject the Lord's authority, and slander his glorious beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>Even the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil and fought over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>Whatever these people do not understand, they slander. Like irrational animals, they are destroyed by the very things they know by instinct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>How terrible it will be for them! For they followed the path of Cain, rushed headlong into Balaam's error to make a profit, and destroyed themselves in Korah's rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These people are stains on your love feasts. They feast with you without any sense of awe. They are shepherds who care only for themselves. They are waterless clouds blown about by the winds. They are autumn trees that are fruitless, twice dead, and uprooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>They are wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their own shame. They are wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about these people when he said,“Look! The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>He will execute judgment on all people and convict everyone of all the ungodly things that they have done in such an ungodly way, including all the harsh things that these ungodly sinners have said about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These people are complainers and faultfinders, following their own desires. Their mouths speak arrogant things, and they flatter people in order to take advantage of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, dear friends, must remember the statements and predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>They kept telling you, “In the last times mockers will appear, following their own ungodly desires.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are the people who cause divisions. They are worldly, devoid of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, dear friends, must continue to build yourselves up on your most holy faith. Pray in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>and remain in God's love as you look for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>Show mercy to those who have doubts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>Save others by snatching them from the fire. To others, show mercy, but with fear, hating even the clothes stained by their sinful lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand faultless in his glorious presence with rejoicing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time and for all eternity! Amen.</verse>
