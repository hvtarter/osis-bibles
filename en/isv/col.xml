        <title>He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.</title>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the holy and faithful brothers in Colossae who are in union with Christ.May grace and peace from God our Father be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>based on the hope laid up for you in heaven. Some time ago you heard about this hope in the word of truth, the gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and spreading all over the world, so it has been doing among you from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>You learned about this gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>He has told us about your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this reason, since the day we heard about this, we have not stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>so that you might live in a manner worthy of the Lord and be fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the full knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>You are being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, so that you might patiently endure everything with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>and might thank the Father, who has enabled us to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>He has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom he loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>For by him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether they are kings, lords, rulers, or powers. All things have been created through him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>He himself existed before all things, and by him all things hold together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>He is also the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself might have first place in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For God was pleased to have all of his fullness live in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>Through him he also reconciled all things to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, thus making peace through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>You who were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>he has now reconciled by the death of his physical body so that he might present you holy, blameless, and without fault before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>However, you must remain firmly established and steadfast in the faith, without being moved from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I am rejoicing in my sufferings for you and completing in my flesh whatever remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body, which is the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>I became its servant according to God's commission that was given to me for you, so that I might fulfill the ministry of the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>This secret was hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom God wanted to make known the glorious riches of this secret among the Gentiles—which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>It is he whom we proclaim as we admonish everyone and teach everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>I work hard and struggle to do this according to his energy that powerfully works in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have never seen me face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>Because they are united in love, I pray that their hearts may be encouraged by all the riches that come from a complete understanding of the full knowledge of Christ, who is the secret of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>I say this so that no one will mislead you with nice-sounding rhetoric.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For although I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see how stable you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>So then, just as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>For you have been rooted in him and are being built up and strengthened in the faith, just as you were taught, while you overflow with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>See to it that no one enslaves you through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in him the whole fullness of God lives in bodily form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And you have been brought to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without human hands by stripping off the corrupt nature in the circumcision performed by Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>When you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>Even when you were dead because of your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with him when he forgave us all of our offenses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having erased the charges that were brought against us with their decrees that were hostile to us. He took those charges away when he nailed them to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>And when he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels cheat you out of the prize by boasting about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without cause by his carnal mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>He does not hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, which is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you have died with Christ to the basic principles of the world, why are you submitting to its decrees as though you still lived in the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>“Don't handle this! Don't taste or touch that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>All of these things will be destroyed through use because they are based on human commands and teachings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These things have the appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they have no value against self-indulgence.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep focusing on the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Keep your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ your life is revealed, then you, too, will be revealed with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>So put to death your worldly impulses: sexual sin, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>It is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>You used to behave like them when you were living among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now you must also get rid of anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene language from your mouth, and all such sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old man with its practices</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have clothed yourselves with the new man, which is being renewed into full knowledge according to the image of the one who created it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>Where this happens, there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free person. Instead, Christ is all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>Put up with one another and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, you also should forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which ties everything together in unity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>Let the peace of Christ also rule in your hearts, to which you were called in one body, and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you with all richness and wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and singing to God with thankfulness in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not make your children resentful, lest they become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched in order to please them, but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly as though you were doing it for the Lord and not merely for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>You know that it is from the Lord that you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It is the Lord Christ whom you are serving!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>For the person who does what is wrong will be paid back for what he has done, and there is no favoritism.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, treat your slaves with justice and fairness, for you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Devote yourselves to prayer. Be alert when you pray with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>At the same time also pray for us—that God would open before us a door for the word so that we may tell the secret about Christ, for which I have been imprisoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>May I reveal it as clearly as I should!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Behave wisely toward outsiders, making the best use of your time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus will tell you everything that has happened to me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>He is coming with Onesimus, that faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have received instructions about him. If he comes to you, welcome him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>Jesus, who is called Justus, also greets you. These are the only ones of the circumcision who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God. They have been an encouragement to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He is always wrestling in his prayers for you, so that you may stand mature and completely convinced of the entire will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I can testify on his behalf that he has a deep concern for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hieropolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea, especially to Nympha and the church that is in her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>When this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans. And be sure to read the one from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>Tell Archippus, “See that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>This greeting is by my own hand—“Paul.” Remember my imprisonment. May grace be with you! Amen.</verse>
