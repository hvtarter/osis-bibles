      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <title>Now may the God of peace be with all of you! Amen.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>From Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and from our brother Sosthenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who continually call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>For in him you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>In this way, our testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>Therefore, you don't lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>He will keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Brothers, I urge all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to be in agreement and not to have divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in your understanding and opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>My brothers, some members of Chloe's family have made it clear to me that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? You weren't baptized in Paul's name, were you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Chrispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest anyone can say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(Yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanus. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God's power to us who are being saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written,	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God decided through the nonsense of our preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power and God's wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For God's nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no human being may boast in God's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>It is because of him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>Therefore, as it is written, “The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come and tell you about God's secret with rhetorical language or wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For while I was with you I resolved to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>It was in weakness, fear, and great trembling that I came to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My message and my preaching were not accompanied by clever words of wisdom, but by a display of the Spirit's power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, when we are among mature people, we do speak a message of wisdom, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are passing off the scene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>Instead, we speak about God's secret wisdom that has been hidden, which God destined for our glory before the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this world understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written,	“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,and no mind has imagined	the things that God has preparedfor those who love him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except by his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God's Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>We don't speak about these things in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>A person who isn't spiritual doesn't accept the things of God's Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can't understand them because they are spiritually evaluated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else's evaluation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For	“Who has known the mind of the Lordso that he can advise him?”However, we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>Brothers, I couldn't talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as mere infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. Why, you're still not ready for it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” you are merely human, aren't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What is Apollos anyhow? Or what is Paul? Mere servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God kept everything growing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>You know that you are God's sanctuary and that God's Spirit lives in you, don't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys God's sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God's sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God's sight. For it is written,	“He catches the wise with their own trickery,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again,	“The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So let no one boast about men. For everything belongs to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—everything belongs to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>but you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>A person should think of us as servants of Christ and managers entrusted with God's secrets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now it is required of managers that each one should prove to be trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>It is a very small thing to me that I should be examined by you or by any human court. In fact, I don't even examine myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For my conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who examines me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore, stop judging before the proper time, before the Lord comes, for he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of our hearts. Then each person will receive his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Brothers, I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will stop boasting about one person at the expense of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You already have all you want! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to death. We have become a spectacle for the world, for angels, and for people to stare at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To this very hour we are hungry, thirsty, dressed in rags, brutally treated, and homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>We wear ourselves out from working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless. When persecuted, we endure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>When slandered, we answer with kind words. Up to this moment we have become the filth of the world, the scum of the universe!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I'm not writing this to make you feel ashamed, but to warn you as my dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>You may have 10,000 guardians in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>So I urge you to become imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>That's why I sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and dependable child in the Lord and will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus as I teach it everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you soon if it's the Lord's will. Then I'll discover not only what these arrogant people are saying but also what power they have,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>for the kingdom of God isn't just talk but power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>Which do you prefer? Should I come to you with a stick, or in love and with a gentle spirit?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, and of a kind that is not found even among the Gentiles. A man is actually living with his father's wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are being arrogant instead of being filled with grief and seeing to it that the man who did this is removed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus and my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus are present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. You know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough, don't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So let us keep celebrating the festival, not with the old yeast or with the yeast of vice and wickedness, but with the bread of purity and truth that has no yeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or greedy people, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. With such a person you must even stop eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are inside, aren't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>God will judge outsiders. “Put that wicked man away from you.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>When one of you has a complaint against another, does he dare to take it before the unrighteous and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>You know that the saints will rule the world, don't you? And if the world is going to be ruled by you, can't you handle insignificant cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelievers at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not allow anything to control me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will put an end to both of them. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>You know that your bodies are parts of Christ, don't you? Should I take the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>You know that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her, don't you? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, don't you? You do not belong to yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>because you were bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God with your bodies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things you wrote about: It's good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because sexual immorality is so rampant, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should do the same for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but his wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so for a set time in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this as a concession, not as a command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I would like everyone to be like me. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows: It is good for them to remain like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord): A wife must not leave her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not bound; God has called you to live in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commandments is everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Everyone should stay in the calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is Christ's slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Brothers, everyone should stay in the calling he was in when called by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Have you been bound to a wife? Stop trying to get free. Have you been freed from a wife? Stop looking for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience distress in the flesh, and I want to spare you that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>This is what I mean, brothers: The time has been shortened. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and so his attention is divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>I'm saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is too strong and he feels he ought to, let him do what he wants; he isn't sinning. Let them get married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>However, if a man stands firm in his resolve and feels no necessity but has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I, too, have God's Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Now concerning eating food offered to idols: We know that no idol is real in the world and that there is only one God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.5'>For even if there are “gods” in heaven and on earth (as indeed there are many so-called “gods” and “lords”),</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idols that they still think they are eating food offered to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it becomes contaminated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>In that case, the weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, in order to keep my brother from falling.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.9'>For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not only concerned about oxen, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Isn't he really speaking on our behalf? Yes, this was written on our behalf, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.14'>In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>But I have not used any of these rights, and I'm not writing this so that they may be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been laid on me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.17'>For if I do this voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with an obligation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.18'>What, then, is my reward? It's to be able to preach the gospel free of charge, and so never resort to using my rights in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.19'>Although I am free from all people, I made myself a slave to all of them to win more of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.20'>To the Jews I became like a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became like a man under the law, in order to win those under the law (although I myself am not under the law).</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>To the weak I became weak in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.1'>For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the fact that all of our ancestors were under the cloud, and they all went through the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.2'>and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.3'>and they all ate the same spiritual food,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.5'>But God wasn't pleased with most of them, and so they were struck down in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.6'>Now these things became examples for us so that we won't set our hearts on evil as they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.7'>Let us stop being idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to play.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.13'>No temptation has overtaken you that is unusual for human beings. But God is faithful, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. Instead, along with the temptation he will also provide a way out, so that you may be able to endure it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.20'>Hardly! What they offer, they offer to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partners with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.21'>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot eat at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.4'>Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.5'>and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, which is the same as having her head shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.6'>So if a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. If it is a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.7'>A man should not cover his own head, because he exists as God's image and glory. But the woman is man's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.8'>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.9'>and man was not created for woman, but woman for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.10'>This is why a woman should have authority over her own head: because of the angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.16'>But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any custom like this, nor do any of God's churches.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, form one body, so it is with Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>So there are many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you,” or the head to the feet, “I don't need you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are in fact indispensable,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable are treated with special honor, and we make our less attractive parts more attractive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>However, our attractive parts don't need this. But God has put the body together and has given special honor to the parts that lack it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>so that there might be no disharmony in the body, but that its parts should have the same concern for each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is praised, every part rejoices with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are Christ's body and individual parts of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>God has appointed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who help others, administrators, and various kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Not all have the gift of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>Keep on desiring the better gifts. And now I will show you the best way of all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak in the tongues of humans and angels but have no love, I have become a reverberating gong or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>If I have the gift of prophecy and can understand all secrets and every form of knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains but have no love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>Even if I give away all that I have and surrender my body so that I may boast but have no love, I get nothing out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is always patient,	Love is always kind,	Love is never envious	Or vaunted up with pride.	Nor is she conceited,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>And never is she rude,	Never does she think of self	Or ever get annoyed.	She never is resentful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Is never glad with sin,	But always glad to side with truth,	Whene'er the truth should win.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>She bears up under everything,	Believes the best in all,	There is no limit to her hope,	And never will she fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails. Now if there are prophecies, they will be done away with. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For what we know is incomplete and what we prophesy is incomplete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>Now we see only a blurred reflection in a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now what I know is incomplete, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>Right now three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Keep on pursuing love, and keep on desiring spiritual gifts, especially the ability to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For the person who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, because he is speaking secrets in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But the person who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, encouragement, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The person who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the person who prophesies builds the church up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but especially that you could prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who speaks in a tongue, unless he interprets it so that the church may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Indeed, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I be to you unless I speak to you in some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>In the same way, lifeless instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. But if there's no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For example, if a bugle doesn't sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>In the same way, unless you speak an intelligible message with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? You'll be talking into the air!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, I suppose, many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If I don't know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>In the same way, since you're so desirous of spiritual gifts, you must keep on desiring them for the upbuilding of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore, the person who speaks in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is not productive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What does this mean? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, but I will also sing psalms with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you say a blessing with your spirit, how can an otherwise uneducated person say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you're saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>It's good for you to give thanks, but it does not build up the other person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>But in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than 10,000 words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, stop being children in your thinking. In evil be infants, but in thinking be adults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written,	“Through people of strange tonguesand through the mouths of foreigners	I will speak to this people,but even then they will not listen to me,”declares the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Tongues, then, are meant to be a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers, while prophecy is meant, not for unbelievers, but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Now if the whole church gathers in the same place and everyone is speaking in tongues, when uneducated people or unbelievers come in, they will say that you are out of your mind, won't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if everyone is prophesying, when an unbeliever or an uneducated person comes in he will be convicted by all and examined by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>The secrets in his heart will become known, and so he will bow down to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is truly among you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What, then, does this mean, brothers? When you gather, everyone has a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation. Everything must be done for upbuilding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, only two or three at the most should do so, one at a time, and somebody must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>If an interpreter is not present, he should remain silent in the church and speak to himself and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If a revelation is made to another person who is seated, the first person should be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For everyone can prophesy in turn, so that everyone can be instructed and everyone can be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>for God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>the women must keep silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak out, but must place themselves in submission, as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Did God's word originate with you? Are you the only people it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone ignores this, he should be ignored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, my brothers, desire the ability to prophesy, and do not prevent others from speaking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But everything must be done in a proper and orderly way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I'm making known to you, brothers, the gospel that I proclaimed to you, which you accepted, on which you have taken your stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>and by which you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the message I proclaimed to you—unless, of course, your faith was worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I passed on to you the most important points of what I received: Christ died for our sins in keeping with the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>he was buried, he was raised on the third day in keeping with the Scriptures—and is still alive!—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and he was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that, he was seen by more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Next he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and finally he was seen by me, as though I were born abnormally late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles and not even fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted God's church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace shown to me was not wasted. Instead, I worked harder than all the others—not I, of course, but God's grace that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>So, whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if we preach that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you keep claiming there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>and if Christ has not been raised, then our message means nothing and your faith means nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God because we testified on God's behalf that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if in fact it is true that the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Yes, even those who have died in Christ are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If we have set our hopes on Christ in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But at this moment Christ stands risen from the dead, the first one offered in the harvest of those who have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>However, this will happen to each person in the proper order: first Christ, then those who belong to Christ when he comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has done away with every ruler and every authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must rule until God puts all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be done away with is death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>for “God has put everything under his feet.” Now when he says, “Everything has been put under him,” this clearly excludes the one who put everything under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But when everything has been put under him, then the Son himself will also become subject to the one who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will those people do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they being baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why in fact are we being endangered every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I face death every day! That is as certain, brothers, as it is that I am proud of you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus from merely human motives, what do I get out of it? If the dead are not raised,	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Stop being deceived:	“Wicked friends lead to evil ends.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Come back to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! For some of you—I say this to your shame—are without a true knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>You fool! The seed you plant does not come to life unless it dies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>and what you plant is not the form that it will be, but a bare kernel, whether it is wheat or something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives the plant the form he wants it to have, and to each kind of seed its own form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals in general have another, birds have another, and fish have still another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of those in heaven is of one kind, and that of those on earth is of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>One kind of splendor belongs to the sun, another to the moon, and still another to the stars. In fact, one star differs from another star in splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>This is how it will be at the resurrection of the dead. What is planted is decaying, what is raised cannot decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>The body is planted in dishonor but raised in splendor. It is planted in weakness but raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is planted a physical body but raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>This, indeed, is what is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>The spiritual does not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man came from the dust of the earth; the second man came from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Those who are made of the dust are like the man from the dust, those who are heavenly are like the man who is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>Just as we have borne the likeness of the man who was made from dust, we will also bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Brothers, this is what I mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Let me tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but all of us will be changed—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will be raised never to decay, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For what is decaying must put on what cannot decay, and what is dying must put on what cannot die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>Now, when what is decaying puts on what cannot decay, and what is dying puts on what cannot die, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: “Death has been swallowed up in victory!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>“Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that your work isn't wasted in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection for the saints, you should follow the directions I gave to the churches in Galatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside and save some of your money in proportion to what you have, so that no collections will have to be made when I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>When I arrive, I will send with letters the men you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.4'>If it is worthwhile for me to go, too, they can go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.5'>I will visit you when I go through Macedonia—for I intend to go through Macedonia—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.6'>and will probably stay with you or even spend the winter. Then you can send me on my way, wherever I decide to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>I do not want to see you now just in passing, because I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.8'>However, I will be staying on in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.9'>because a door has opened wide for me to do effective work, although many people are opposing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.10'>If Timothy comes, see to it that he does not have anything to be afraid of while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord's work as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.11'>Therefore, no one should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me, because I am expecting him along with the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not inclined to go just now. However, he will come when the time is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.13'>Remain alert. Keep standing firm in your faith. Keep on being courageous and strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.14'>Everything you do should be done in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.15'>Now I urge you, brothers—for you know that the members of the family of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serving the saints—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.16'>to submit yourselves to people like these and to anyone else who shares their labor and hard work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.17'>I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.18'>They refreshed my spirit—and yours, too. Therefore, appreciate men like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.19'>The churches in Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the church in their house greet you warmly in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.20'>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.21'>I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.22'>If anyone doesn't love the Lord, let him be condemned! May our Lord come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.23'>May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.24'>My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
