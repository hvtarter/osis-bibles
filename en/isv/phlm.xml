      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <title>These are the things you should say. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.</title>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I keep hearing about your love and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every blessing that is ours in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have received considerable joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed, brother, through you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>For this reason, although in Christ I have complete freedom to order you to do what is proper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>I prefer to make my appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>appeal to you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful both to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>Yet I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be something forced, but voluntary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you could have him back forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave but better than a slaveâ€”as a dear brother, especially to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. (I will not mention to you that you owe me your very life.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, I desire this favor from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even more than I ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Meanwhile, prepare a guest room for me, too, for I am hoping through your prayers to be returned to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen.</verse>
