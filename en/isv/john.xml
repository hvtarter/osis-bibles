      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <title>Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</title>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning, the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He existed in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>Through him all things were made, and apart from him nothing was made that has been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and that life brought light to humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>This was the true light that enlightens every person by his coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own creation, yet his own people did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>However, to all who received him, to those believing in his name, he gave authority to become God's children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not merely in a physical sense, or from a fleshly impulse, or from man's desire, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We gazed on his glory, the kind of glory that belongs to the Father's unique Son, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John told the truth about him when he cried out, “This is the person about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>From his fullness we have all received one gracious gift after another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God. The unique God, who is close to the Father's side, has revealed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>This was John's testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He spoke openly and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>So they asked him, “Well then, are you Elijah?”He said, “I am not.”“Are you the Prophet?”He answered, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, “Who are you? We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He replied,	“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’”as the prophet Isaiah said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>They asked him, “Why, then, are you baptizing if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, “I am baptizing with water, but among you stands a man whom you do not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>the one who is coming after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I didn't recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also testified, “I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I didn't recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The person on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>I have seen this and have testified that this is the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day John was standing there again with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>As he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>But when Jesus turned around and saw them following, he said to them,“What are you looking for?”They said to him, “Rabbi,” (which is translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He told them,“Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>Andrew first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “Christ”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He led Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him intently and said,“You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated “Peter”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day Jesus decided to go away into Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,“Follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathaniel and told him, “We have found the man about whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote—Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathaniel said to him, “Out of Nazareth? What good can that be?”Philip told him, “Come and see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him,“Look, a true Israelite, in whom there is no falsehood!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathaniel said to him, “How do you know me?”Jesus answered him,“Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus said to him,“Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>Then he said to him,“Truly, truly I tell all of you,you will see heaven standing open and the angels of God going up and coming down to the Son of Man.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They don't have any wine.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her,“How does that concern us, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus told the servants,“Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then he said to them,“Now draw some out and take it to the man in charge of the banquet.” So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, “Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they remained there for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>Making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>Then he told those who were selling the doves,“Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews said to him, “What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them,“Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will rebuild it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews said, “This sanctuary has been under construction for forty-six years, and you're going to rebuild it in three days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and didn't need anyone to tell him what people were like. For he himself knew what was in every person.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man from the Pharisees, a leader of the Jews, whose name was Nicodemus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>He came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you are doing unless God is with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus replied to him,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless a person is born from abovehe cannot see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He can't go back into his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless a person is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>Whatis born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Don't be astonished that I said to you, ‘All of youmust be born from above.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The windblows where it wants to. You hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going. That's the way it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus said to him, “How can that be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered him,“You're the teacher of Israel, and you can't understand this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly I tell you, we know what we're talking about, and we testify about what we've seen. Yet you peopledo not accept our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you peopleabout earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>“No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>“For this is how God loved the world: He gave his unique Son so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God's unique Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the basis for judgment: The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their actions were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his actions may not be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that all may seethat his actions have been done in God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>since John had not yet been thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between John's disciples and a certain Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>They went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he's baptizing, and all are going to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom's friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom's voice. That's why this joy of mine is now complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must become more important, but I must become less important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>The one who comes from above is over everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is over everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John—</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>although it was not Jesus who did the baptizing but his disciples—</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and went back to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob's Well was also there, and Jesus, tired out by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about twelve noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her,“Please give me a drink.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone off into town to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews do not have anything to do with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered her,“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Please give me a drink,’ you would have been the one to ask him, and he would have given you living water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, “Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>You're not greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it, along with his sons and his flocks, are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered her,“Everyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never become thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I won't get thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He said to her,“Go and call your husband, and come back here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered him, “I don't have a husband.”Jesus said to her,“You are quite right in saying, ‘I don't have a husband.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her,“Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you Samaritanswill worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You don't know what you're worshiping. We know what we're worshiping, for salvation comes from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>Yet the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spiritand truth. Indeed, the Father is looking for people like that to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit,and those who worship him must worship in spiritand truth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will tell us everything.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her,“I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>At this point his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want from her?” or, “Why are you talking to her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>“Come and see a man who told me everything I've ever done! Could he possibly be the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>The people left the town and started on their way to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, have something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them,“I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus told them,“My food is doing the will of the one who sent me and completing his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>You say, don't you, ‘In four more months the harvest will be here?’ Look, I tell you, open your eyes and observe that the fields are readyfor harvesting!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The one who harvests is already receiving his wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who harvests may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this respect the saying is true: ‘One person sows, and another person harvests.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I have sent you to harvest what you have not labored for. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now many of the Samaritans of that town believed in Jesus because of the woman's testimony when she testified, “He told me everything I've ever done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>They kept telling the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the Savior of the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Two days later, Jesus went from that place to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival. For they, too, had gone to the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Meanwhile, in Capernaum there was a government official whose son was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him repeatedly to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus told him,“Unless you peoplesee signs and wonders, you will never believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The official said to him, “Sir, please come down before my little boy dies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him,“Go home. Your son will live.” The man believed what Jesus told him and started on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>While he was on his way down, his servants met him and told him that his child was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he asked them at what hour he had begun to recover, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him,“Your son will live.” And he himself believed, along with his whole family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>Later on, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It has five colonnades,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>and under these a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, or paralyzed—waiting for the movement of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For at certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water. And the one who stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>One particular man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him,“Do you want to get well?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered him, “Sir, I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him,“Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me,‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, “Who is the man who told you,‘Pick it up and walk’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Later on, Jesus found him in the temple and told him,“See, you have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>So the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he kept doing such things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them,“My Father has been working until now, and I, too, am working.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>So the Jews were trying all the harder to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For what he does, the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And he will show him even greater works than these, so that you may be amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he chooses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>“Truly, truly I tell you, the one who hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And he has given him authority to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Don't be amazed at this, because the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and will come out—those who have done what is good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced what is evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing on my own accord. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about me, and I knowthat the testimony he gives about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent messengersto John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>I myself do not accept human testimony, but I am saying these things so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>That man was a lamp that burns and brightly shines, and for a while you were willing to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a greater testimony than John's, for the works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>Moreover, the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>nor do you have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You examine the Scriptures carefully because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. Yet they testify about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>But you are not willing to come to me to have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>“I do not accept human praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>I know that you do not have the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me. Yet if another man comes in his own name, you will accept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe when you accept each other's praise and do not look for the praise that comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not suppose that I will be the one to accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for it was about me that he wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe my words?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After this, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>A large crowd kept following him because they had seen the signs that he was performing on the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>But Jesus went up on a hillside and sat down there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward him, he said to Philip,“Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>Jesus said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get a little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>“There's a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are they among so many people?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said,“Have the people sit down.” Now there was plenty of grass in that place. So the men sat down, numbering about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He also distributed the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they were completely satisfied, he told his disciples,“Collect the pieces that are left over so that nothing is lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they kept saying, “Truly this is the Prophet who was to come into the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the hillside by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>They had rowed about three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat. They became terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them,“It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>So they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that only one boat had been there, and no other, and that Jesus had not gotten into that boat with his disciples. Instead, his disciples had gone away by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>Other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus replied to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were completely satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered them,“This is the work of God: to believe in the one whom he has sent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>So they said to him, “What sign are you going to do so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you performing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them,“I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never become hungry, and the one who believes in me will never become thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>I told you that you have seen me, yet you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything that he has given me, but should raise it to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is my Father's will, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Then the Jews began grumbling about him because he said,“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They kept saying, “This is Jesus, the son of Joseph, isn't it, whose father and mother we know? So how can he say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered them,“Stop grumbling among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the Prophets, ‘And all of them will be taught by God.’Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned anything comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who comes from God. This one has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly I tell you, the one who believes in mehas eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that a person may eat it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. And the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Then the Jews debated angrily with each other, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>So Jesus told them,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is realfood, and my blood is realdrink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will also live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not the kind that your ancestors ate. They died, but the one who eats this bread will live forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He said this while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>When many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This is a difficult statement. Who can accept it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them,“Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What if you saw the Son of Man going up to the place where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some among you who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew those who wouldn't believe, as well as the one who would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>So he said,“That's why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>As a result, many of his disciples turned back and no longer associated with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>So Jesus said to the twelve,“You don't want to leave, too, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>Besides, we have believed and remain convinced that you are the Holy One of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them,“I chose you twelve, didn't I? Yet one of you is a devil.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Now he was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, even though he was one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he didn't want to travel in Judea because the Jews were trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So his brothers said to him, “You should leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples can see the works that you're doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one acts in secret if he wants to be known publicly. If you're going to do these things, you should reveal yourself to the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For not even his brothers believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus told them,“My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go up to the festival yourselves. I am not yetgoing to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he went up himself, not openly but, as it were, in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews kept looking for him at the festival, saying, “Where is that man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was a great deal of discussion about him among the crowds.Some were saying, “He is a good man,” while others were saying, “No, he is deceiving the crowd!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>No one, however, would speak openly about him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews were astonished and remarked, “How can this man be so educated when he has never gone to school?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus replied to them,“My teaching is not mine but comes from the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone wants to do his will, he will know whether this teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The one who speaks on his own seeks his own praise. But the one who seeks the praise of him who sent him is true, and there is nothing false in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Moses gave you the law, didn't he? Yet none of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered them,“I performed one work, and all of you are astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses gave you circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but from the Patriarchs—and so you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man perfectly well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Stop judging by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of the people of Jerusalem began saying, “This is the man they are trying to kill, isn't it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And look, he is speaking in public, and they are not saying anything to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>We know where this man comes from. But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>At this point Jesus, still teaching in the temple, shouted,“So you know me and know where I have come from? I have not come on my own accord. But the one who sent me is true, and he is the one you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him because I have come from him and he sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>However, many in the crowd believed in him, saying, “When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than this man has done, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd debating these things about him, so the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said,“I will be with you only a little while longer, and then I am going back to the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will look for me but will not find me.And where I am, you cannot come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Then the Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go so that we will not find him? Surely he's not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does this statement mean that he made,‘You will look for me but will not find me,’ and‘Where I will be, you cannot come’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted,“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to meand drink!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have rivers of living water flowing from his heart.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who were believing in him were to receive. For the Spirit was not yet present, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>When they heard these words, some in the crowd were saying, “This really is the Prophet,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>while others were saying, “This is the Christ!”But some were saying, “The Christ doesn't come from Galilee, does he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ is from David's family and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Then the officers returned to the high priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn't you bring him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You haven't been deceived, too, have you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>None of the authorities or Pharisees has believed in him, has he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this mob that does not know the law—they are accursed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>One of their number, Nicodemus (the man who had previously gone to him), said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>“Surely our law does not condemn a person without first hearing from him and finding out what he is doing, does it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered him, “You aren't from Galilee, too, are you? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then each of them went to his own home.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>Jesus, however, went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>At daybreak he appeared again in the temple, and all the people came to him. So he sat down and began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>But the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. After setting her before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women to death. What do you say?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to test him, so that they might have a charge against him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>When they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,“Let the person among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>When they heard this, they went away one by one, beginning with the oldest, and he was left alone with the woman standing there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Then Jesus stood up and said to her,“Woman, where are your accusers?Hasn't anyone condemned you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, “No one, sir.”Then Jesus said,“I don't condemn you either. Go home, and from now on do not sin any more.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Later on Jesus spoke to them again, saying,“I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered them,“Even though I am testifying about myself, my testimony is validbecause I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You are judging by human standards,but I am not judging anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>Yet even if I should judge, my judgment would be valid,for it is not I alone who judges, but I and the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>In your own law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am testifying about myself, and the Father who sent me is testifying about me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they said to him, “Where is this Father of yours?”Jesus replied,“You do not know me or my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>He spoke these words in the treasury, while he was teaching in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Later on he said to them again,“I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. You cannot come where I am going.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>So the Jews said, “He isn't going to kill himself, is he? Is that why he said,‘You cannot come where I am going’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>He said to them,“You are from below, I am from above. You are of this world, but I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then they said to him, “Who are you?”Jesus told them,“What have I been telling you all along?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have much to say about you and to condemn you for.But the one who sent me is truthful,and what I have heard from him I declare to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They didn't realize that he was talking to them about the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus told them,“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority. Instead, I speak only what the Father has taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>Moreover, the one who sent me is with me. He has never left me alone because I always do what pleases him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>While he was saying these things, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in him,“If you continue in my word, you are really my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They replied to him, “We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves to anybody. So how can you say,‘You will be set free’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them,“Truly, truly I tell you that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>The slave does not remain in the household forever, but the son does remain forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>“I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are trying to kill me because my word finds no reception among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I declare what I have seen in myFather's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They replied to him, “Our father is Abraham!”Jesus said to them,“If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham would not have done that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You are doing your father's works.”They said to him, “We are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, God himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus told them,“If God were your Father, you would have loved me, because I came from God and am here. For I have not come on my own accord, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why don't you understand my language? It's because you can't listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You belong to your father the devil, and you want to carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood by the truth,since there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie he speaks in character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But it is because I speak the truth that you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>The one who belongs to God listens to the words of God. The reason you do not listen is because you do not belong to God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews replied to him, “Surely we are right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon, aren't we?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered,“I don't have a demon. On the contrary, I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks it, and he is the Judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly I tell you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Then the Jews said to him, “Now we really know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say,‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death at all.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>You aren't greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who are you making yourself out to be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered,“If I were trying to glorify myself, my glory would mean nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>You don't know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I don't know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>Then the Jews said to him, “You are not even fifty years old, yet you have seen Abraham?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, before there was an Abraham, I am!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>At this, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As he was walking along, he observed a man who had been blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered,“Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so thatthe works of God might be revealed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>Imust work the works of the one who sent mewhile it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>After saying this, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he spread the mud on the man's eyes</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>and told him,“Go and wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “Sent One”). So he went off and washed and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Then the neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a beggar said, “This is the man who used to sit and beg, isn't it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some were saying, “It is he,” while others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.”He himself kept saying, “It is I!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>So they said to him, “How, then, were your eyes opened?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He said, “The man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me,‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So off I went and washed, and I received my sight.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>They said to him, “Where is that man?”He said, “I don't know!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>So they brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>So the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Some of the Pharisees began to remark, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.”But others were saying, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, for it was your eyes he opened?”He said, “He is a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had been given sight until they summoned his parents</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How does he now see?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>But we don't know how it is that he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and can speak for himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>That's why his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>But he responded, “I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, “I've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples, too, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>At this, they turned on him furiously and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man answered them, “This is an amazing thing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Never since creation has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he couldn't do anything like that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They said to him, “You were born entirely in sins, and you are trying to instruct us?” And they threw him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him, he said,“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said to him,“You have seen him. He is the person who is talking with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>He said, “Lord, I do believe,” and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>Then Jesus said,“I have come into this world for judgment, so that those who are blind may see, and those who see may become blind.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some of the Pharisees who were near him overheard this and said to him, “We aren't blind, too, are we?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus told them,“If you were blind, you would not have any sin. But now that you insist, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>“Truly, truly I tell you, the person who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a bandit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>It is to him the gatekeeper opens the gate, and it is his voice the sheep hear. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>When he has driven out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus used this illustration with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>So again Jesus said,“Truly, truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All who came before meare thieves and bandits, but the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays downhis life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, deserts the sheep, and runs away. So the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>For he is a hired hand, and the sheep do not matter to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay downmy life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must lead these also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one is taking it from me; I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This is a command that I have received from my Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why bother listening to him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>Others were saying, “These are not the words of a man who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>Now Hanukkah was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>and Jesus was walking around in the temple inside the open porch of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>So the Jews surrounded him and said to him, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered them,“I have told you, but you do not believe it. The works that I do in my Father's name testify on my behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it from the Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus replied to them,“I have shown you many good works from myFather. For which of them are you going to stone me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you for a good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus replied to them,“Is it not written in yourlaw, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called those to whom the word of God came ‘gods’ (and the Scripture cannot be set aside),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>how can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I am not doing my Father's works, do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understandthat the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Again they tried to seize him, but he slipped away out of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>Then he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Many people came to him and kept saying, “John never performed a sign, but all the things that John said about this man were true!”</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one whom you love is ill.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard it, he said,“This illness is not meant to end in death. It is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed where he was for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>After this he said to the disciples,“Let's go back to Judea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you to death, and you are going back there again?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus replied,“There are twelve hours in the day, aren't there? If anyone walks during the day he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if anyone walks at night he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These were the things he said. Then after this he told them,“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am leaving to wake him up.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about resting or sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly,“Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>For your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let's go, too, so that we may die with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus told her,“Your brother will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her,“I am the resurrection and the life.The person who believes in me, even though he dies, will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>Indeed, everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>When the Jews who had been with her, consoling her in the house, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she had gone to the tomb to cry there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was greatly troubled in spirit and deeply moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>He said,“Where have you put him?”They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus burst into tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, “Surely the one who opened the eyes of the blind man could have kept this man from dying, couldn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Groaning deeply again, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said,“Remove the stone.”Martha, the dead man's sister, told him, “Lord, there must be a stench by now, because he's been dead for four days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her,“I told you that if you believed you would see God's glory, didn't I?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they removed the stone.Then Jesus looked upward and said,“Father, I thank you for hearing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice,“Lazarus, come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The dead man came out, his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them,“Untie him, and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had observed what Jesus did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, “What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our nation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, “You don't know anything!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>You don't realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now he did not say this on his own initiative. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not only for the nation, but that he would also gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day on they resolved to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>As a result, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness. There he remained with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and before the Passover many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where he was should tell them so that they could arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, the man whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard and anointed Jesus’ feet. She wiped his feet with her hair, and the house became filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>“Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>He said this, not because he cared about the destitute, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said,“Leave her alone, so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus, too,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>since he was the reason why so many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Then Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>“Stop being afraid, daughter of Zion.	Look, your king is coming,sitting upon a donkey's colt!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>At first his disciples didn't understand these things. However, when Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that people had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify to what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>This accounts for the crowd going out to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see, there is nothing you can do. Look, the world has gone after him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus said to them,“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces a lot of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>The one who loves his life will destroy it, and the one who hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves me, he must follow me. And where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>“Now my soul is in turmoil, and what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No! It was for this very reason that I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name.”Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd standing there heard this and said that it was thunder. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus replied, “This voice has come for your benefit, not for mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the time for the judgment of this world to begin.Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to indicate the kind of death he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>Then the crowd answered him, “We have learned from the law that the Christ remains forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus said to them,“The light is among you only for a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The person who walks in the darkness is in the darkness and does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>As long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he went away and hid from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Although he had performed numerous signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>so that the word that the prophet Isaiah spoke might be fulfilled when he said:	“Lord, who has believed our message,and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah also said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their heart,	so that they might not perceive with their eyes,and understand with their heart and turn,and I would heal them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this when he saw his glory and spoke about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet many people, even some of the authorities, believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it for fear that they would be thrown out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of people more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus said loudly,“The one who believes in me does not believe in me but in the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>The one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come into the world as light, so that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not condemn him, for I did not come to condemn the world but to save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has something to judge him: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken on my own authority. Instead, the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and how to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak, therefore, I speak just as the Father has told me.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the Passover Festival, Jesus realized that his hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>By supper time, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>got up from the table, removed his outer robe, and took a towel and fastened it around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel that was tied around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered him,“You do not realize now what I am doing, but later on you will understand.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, “You must never wash my feet!”Jesus answered him,“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus told him,“The person who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is entirely clean. And you menare clean, though not all of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said,“Not all of you are clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer robe, he sat down again and said to them,“Do you realize what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right because that is what I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you must also wash one another's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, so that you may do as I have done to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Truly, truly I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, and a messenger is not greater than the one who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If you understand these things, how blessed you are if you put them into practice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I'm not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But the Scripture must be fulfilled: ‘The one who ate bread with mehas lifted up his heel againstme.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>I'm telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe that I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>Truly, truly I tell you, the one who receives whomever I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled in spirit and declared solemnly,“Truly, truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples began looking at one another, completely mystified about whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus kept loving, was sitting very close to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>So Simon Peter motioned to this man to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Leaning forward on Jesus’ chest, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered,“He is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.”Then he took a piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>After he had taken the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him,“Do quickly what you are going to do!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>Some thought that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the destitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went outside. And it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>When he had gone out, Jesus said,“The Son of Man is now glorified, and God has been glorified in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify the Son of Manin himself, and he will glorify him at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me, but what I told the JewsI now tell you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>I am giving you a new commandment to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?”Jesus answered him,“I am going where you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later on.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>Peter said to him, “Lord, why can't I follow you now? I would lay down my life for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>Jesus answered him,“Would you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I tell you, a rooster will certainly not crow until you have denied me three times.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Then Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen, went forward and said to them,“Who are you looking for?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, “Jesus from Nazareth.”Jesus said to them,“I am he.” Judas, the man who betrayed him, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When Jesus told them,“I am he,” they backed away and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>So he asked them again,“Who are you looking for?”They said, “Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered,“My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.But for now my kingdom is not from here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?”Jesus answered,“You say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, “What is ‘truth’?” After he said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>At this, they shouted out again, “Not this fellow, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and whipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>The soldiers twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, put it on his head, and threw a purple robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” Then they began to slap him on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went outside again and told the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came outside, wearing the victor's crown of thorns and the purple robe.Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the high priests and the officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”Pilate told them, “You take him and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered Pilate, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he made himself out to be the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard this, he became even more afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>Returning to his headquarters, he said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>So Pilate said to him, “Aren't you going to speak to me? You realize, don't you, that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered him,“You have no authority over me at all, except what was given to you from above. That's why the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From then on, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this fellow, you're not a friend of Caesar! Anyone who claims to be a king is defying Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called The Pavement, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation Day for the Passover, about twelve noon. He said to the Jews, “Here is your king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>Then they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your king?”The high priests responded, “We have no king but Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then Pilate handed him over to be crucified, and they took Jesus away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>Carrying the cross all by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they crucified him, along with two others, one on each side of him with Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the Jewish high priests told Pilate, “Don't write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this fellow said,‘I am the King of the Jews.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and took his cloak as well. The cloak was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it. Instead, let's throw dice to see who gets it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture that says,	“They divided my clothes among themselves,and for my clothing they threw dice.”So that is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Meanwhile, standing near Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he kept loving standing there, he said to his mother,“Woman, here is your son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple,“Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, when Jesus realized that everything was now completed, he said (in order to fulfill the Scripture),“I'm thirsty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A jar of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>After Jesus had taken the wine, he said,“It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and released his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Since it was the Preparation Day, the Jews did not want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath, for that was a particularly important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate to have the men's legs broken and the bodies removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>The one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows he is telling the truth so that you, too, may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 	“None of his bones will be broken.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>In addition, another passage of Scripture says, 	“They will look on the one whom they pierced.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>Later on, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, and he came and removed his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus, the man who had first come to Jesus at night, also arrived, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths along with spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>A garden was located in the place where he was crucified, and in that garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day, and because the tomb was nearby, they put Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week, early in the morning and while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and noticed that the stone had been removed from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran off and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus kept loving. She told them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>So Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>Bending over to look inside, he noticed the linen cloths lying there but didn't go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>At this point Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went straight into the tomb. He observed that the linen cloths were lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus’ head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that he had to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>So the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus’ body had been lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her,“Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her,“Mary!”She turned around and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means “Teacher”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus told her,“Don't hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” She also told them what he had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord the disciples were overjoyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said to them again,“Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,“Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive people's sins, they are forgiven. If you retain people's sins, they are retained.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called the Twin, wasn't with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the other disciples kept telling him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he told them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>A week later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas,“Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, but believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered him, saying “My Lord and my God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him,“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed? How blessed are those who have never seen me and yet have believed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, “I'm going fishing.”They told him, “We'll go with you, too.” So they went out and got into the boat but didn't catch a thing that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Just as dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, “Children, you don't have any fish, do you?”They answered him, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He told them,“Throw the net on the right hand side of the boat, and you'll catchsome.” So they threw it out and were unable to haul it in because it was so full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple whom Jesus kept loving said to Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on his clothes, for he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about a hundred yards away from the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus told them,“Bring me some of the fish you've just caught.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish—153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Then Jesus said to them,“Come, have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”, for they knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Feed my lambs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>Then he said to him a second time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Take care of my sheep.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him a third time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”Peter was deeply hurt that he had said to him a third time,“Do you love me?”So he said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!”Jesus told him,“Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>“Truly, truly I tell you, when you were young, you would fasten your belt and go wherever you liked. But when you get old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don't want to go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God.After saying this, he told him,“Keep following me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus’ chest at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>When Peter saw him, he said, “Lord, what about him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you? You must keep following me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn't going to die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wasn't going to die, but,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down the world couldn't contain the books that would be written.</verse>
