      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <title>So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.</title>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,“See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John was dressed in camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He kept proclaiming, “The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>Then a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>He was in the wilderness for forty days being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>He said,“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing in the gospel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>So immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Going on a little farther he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them like one with authority and not like their scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Suddenly there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit. He screamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying,“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him all those who were sick or possessed by demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>In fact, the whole city gathered at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Simon and his companions searched diligently for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found him, they told him, “Everyone's looking for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>He said to them,“Let's go to the neighboring towns so that I can preach there, too. For that is why I came out here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and said to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said to him,“I do want to. Be made clean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Then Jesus sternly warned him and drove him away at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>telling him,“See to it that you don't say anything to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the word so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was reported that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>So many crowds had gathered that there wasn't any room left for them, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking the word to them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>“Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. He said to them,“Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>“I say to you, get up, pick up your cot, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>So the man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and went out before all of them.As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus said to him,“Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Later he was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard that, he said to them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can't fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is pouredinto fresh wineskins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Jesus happened to be going through the grainfields on the Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He said to them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How was it that he went into the House of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>Then he said to them,“The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>Jesus went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>The people watched Jesus closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He said to the man with the paralyzed hand,“Come forward.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he asked them,“Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill it?” But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>Jesus looked around at them with anger, for he was deeply hurt because of their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand was restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>Immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to plot against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>So Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed so many people that all who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve whom he called apostles to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have the authority to drive out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>He appointed these twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James, the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; Simon the Cananaean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>Then he went home. The crowd came together again, so that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him. For they kept saying, “He's out of his mind!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, “He has Beelzebul,” and “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables.“How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>Ifa kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>TrulyI tell you, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of eternal sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>For they had been saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent word to him and called for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>He answered them,“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said,“Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Then Jesus began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>“Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Others fell on stony ground, where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn't deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots, they dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Others fell among thornbushes, and the thornbushes came up and choked them, and they did not produce anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred times what was sown.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>He added,“Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was alone with his followers and the twelve, they began to ask him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He said to them,“The secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>sothat‘they may see clearly but not perceive,and they may hear clearly but not understand,otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>Then he said to them,“You don't understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>Some people are like the seedsalong the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>Others are like the seedssown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, they accept it at once with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but since they don't have any roots in themselves, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>Still others are like the seedssown among the thornbushes. These are the people who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>Others are like the seedssown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops—thirty, sixty, or one hundred times what was sown.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>Then Jesus said to them,“A lamp isn't brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? It's to be put on a lampstand, isn't it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For nothing is hidden except for the purpose of having it revealed, and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>He went on to say to them,“Pay attention to what you're listening to! With the measure you use,you will be measured, and still more will be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has something, will have more given to him. But whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He was also saying,“The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow, although he doesn't know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The ground produces grain by itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the grain is ripe, he swings his sickle immediately because the harvest time has come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>He was also saying,“How can we show what the kingdom of God is like, or what parable can we use to describe it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. Although it is the smallest ofall the seeds on earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>when it is planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many other parables like these Jesus kept speaking the word to them according to their ability to understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>He did not tell them anything without using a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>That day, when evening had come, he said to them,“Let's cross to the other side.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>So they left the crowd and took him along in the boat just as he was. Other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly becoming swamped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,“Hush! Be still!” Then the wind stopped blowing, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>He said to them,“Why are you such cowards? Don't you have any faith yet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>They were overcome with fear and kept saying to one another, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>Just as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>He had often been restrained with shackles and chains but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Night and day he kept screaming among the tombs and on the mountainsides and kept cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>screaming in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I command you in the name of God not to torture me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For Jesus had been saying to him,“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Then Jesus asked him,“What's your name?”He said to him, “My name is Legion, because there are many of us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>He kept pleading with Jesus not to send them out of the territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So the demons begged him, “Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened in the city and countryside. So the people went to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>The people who had seen it told them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>So they began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging him to let him go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus wouldn't let him. Instead, he told him,“Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So the man left and began proclaiming in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was utterly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat, a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and begged him urgently, saying, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>So Jesus went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all but rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she had been saying, “If I can just touch his robe, I will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked,“Who touched my clothes?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask,‘Who touched me?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said to her,“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your illness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader's home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But when Jesus heard what they said, he told the synagogue leader,“Stop being afraid! Just keep on believing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>Jesus allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw mass confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>He entered the house and said to them,“Why all this confusion and crying? The child isn't dead but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>They laughed and laughed at him. But he forced all of them outside. Then he took the child's father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>He took her by the hand and said to her,“Talitha koum,” which means,“Little girl, I tell you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>The little girl got up at once and started to walk, for she was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>But Jesus strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. They said, “Where did this man get all these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?” And they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>Jesus was telling them,“A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He was utterly amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick—no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>He told them repeatedly,“Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you leave that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>If any place will not welcome you and thepeoplerefuse to listen to you, when you leave, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>So they went and preached that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They also kept driving out many demons and pouring oil on many who were sick and healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard about this, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why these miracles are at work in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others were saying, “He is Elijah.” Still others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard about it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For Herod had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>John had been telling Herod, “It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John, he did much of what he said. In fact, he liked listening to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He swore with an oath to her, “I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?”Her mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>Immediately the girl hurried back to the king with her request, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>Then he brought John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When John's disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>He said to them,“Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest for a while.” For so many people were coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they went away in a boat to a deserted place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it was quite late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send the crowds away so that they can go to the neighboring farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered them,“You give them something to eat.”They said to him, “Should we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.”They found out and told him, “Five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>All of them ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>Then the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover bread and fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>There were 5,000 men who had eaten the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Jesus immediately had his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him, while he sent the crowd away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a hillside to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>He saw that they were straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea. He intended to go up right beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and began to scream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately he said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were utterly astounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed over, they came ashore at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They ran all over the countryside and began carrying the sick on their cots to any place where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>Wherever he went, whether into villages, towns, or farms, people would place their sick in the marketplaces and beg him to let them touch even the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, that is, without washing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees and indeed all the Jewish people don't eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of their elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>They don't eat anything from the marketplace unless they dip it in water. They also observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unclean hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>He told them,“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites. As it is written,‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>Then he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses his father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me is Corban,”’(that is, an offering to God)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>You are destroying the word of God through your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other things like that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>Then he called to the crowd again and said to them,“Listen to me, all of you, and understand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When he had left the crowd and gone home, his disciples began asking him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He said to them,“Are you so ignorant? Don't you know that nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and is expelled as waste.” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>He continued,“It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil thoughts come, as well as sexual immorality, stealing, murder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>adultery, greed, wickedness, cheating, shameless lust, envy, slander,arrogance, and foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these things come from within and make a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, not wanting anyone to know he was there. However, it couldn't be kept a secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>In fact, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman happened to be a Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She kept asking him to drive the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But he kept telling her,“First let the children be filled. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the puppies under the table eat some of the children's crumbs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then he said to her,“Because you have said this, go! The demon has left your daughter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>So she went home and found the child lying in bed, and the demon was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Then Jesus left the territory of Tyre and passed through Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>Some people brought him a deaf man who also had a speech impediment. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. Putting his fingers into the man's ears, he touched his tongue with saliva.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him,“Ephphatha,” that is,“Be opened!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>At once the man's ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to talk normally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone, but the more he kept ordering them, the more they kept spreading the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>They were amazed beyond measure, saying, “He does everything well! He even makes deaf people hear and mute people talk!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when a large crowd again had gathered with nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>“I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>If I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the road. Some of them have come a long distance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples answered him, “Where could anyone get enough bread to feed these people out here in the wilderness?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to distribute. So they served them to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and said that the fish should also be distributed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>The people ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up the leftover pieces—seven large baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now about 4,000 men were there. Then he sent them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees arrived and began arguing with Jesus. They tested him by demanding from him a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>He sighed deeply in his spirit and said,“Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>Leaving them, he got into a boat again and crossed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread along and had only one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Jesus had been warning them,“Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>So they were discussing with one another the fact that they didn't have any bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Knowing this, Jesus said to them,“Why are you discussing the fact that you don't have any bread? Don't you understand or perceive yet? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Doyou have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear?Don't you remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>WhenI broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?”They told him, “Twelve.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>“When I brokethe seven loavesfor the 4,000, how many large baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces?”They told him, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>Then he said to them,“Don't you perceive yet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>As they came to Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spit into his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him,“Do you see anything?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>The man looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees walking around.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and he saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he saw everything perfectly even from a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Then Jesus sent him home, saying,“Don't go into the village or tell anyone in the village.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Then Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he was asking his disciples,“Who do people say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They answered him, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Then he began to ask them,“But who do you say I am?”Peter answered him, “You are the Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Jesus sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man would have to suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but after three days he would rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>He was speaking about this matter quite openly.Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But turning and looking at his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter, saying,“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Then Jesus called the crowd to himself along with his disciples and said to them,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Indeed, what can a person give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes with the holy angels in his Father's glory.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>Then he said to them,“Truly I tell you, some people standing here will not experiencedeath until they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain to be alone with him. His appearance was changed in front of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Then Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>(Peter didn't know how to respond, for they were terrified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love. Keep on listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>Suddenly, as they looked around, they saw no one with them but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>On their way down the mountain, he ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>They kept the matter to themselves but argued about what “rising from the dead” meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>So they asked him, “Don't the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He told them,“Elijah is indeed coming first and will restore all things. Why, then, is it written that the Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be treated shamefully?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I tell you that Elijah has come, yet peopletreated him just as they pleased, as it is written about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>As they approached the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>The whole crowd was very surprised to see Jesus and ran to welcome him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>He asked the scribes,“What are you arguing about with them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>A man in the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that won't let him talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>Whenever it brings on a seizure, it throws him to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff. So I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they didn't have the power.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus said to them,“You unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and kept rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Then Jesus asked his father,“How long has this been happening to him?” He said, “Since he was a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>The spirit has often thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him,“‘If you are able?’ Everything is possible for the person who believes!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>With tears flowing, the child's father at once cried out, “I do believe! Help my unbelief!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,“You spirit that won't let him talk or hear—I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>The spirit screamed, shook the child violently, and came out. The boy was like a corpse, and many said that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took his hand and helped him up, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>When Jesus came home, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>He told them,“This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Then they left that place and were passing through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was teaching his disciples and saying to them,“The Son of Man will be betrayed into human hands. They will kill him, but after being dead for three days he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>They didn't understand what this statement meant, and were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was at home, he asked the disciples,“What were you arguing about on the road?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they kept silent, for on the road they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>So he sat down and called the twelve. He told them,“If anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He took him in his arms and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>“Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said,“Don't stop him! For no one who works a miracle in my name can slander me soon afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>Truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christwill never lose his reward.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>So if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life injured than to have two hands and go to hell,to the fire that cannot be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how can you restore its flavor? Keep on having salt among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Then Jesus left that place and went into the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered around him as usual, and he began to teach them again as was his custom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>He answered them,“What did Moses command you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to divorce her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>But Jesus said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that he wrote this command for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>But from the beginning of creation, ‘Godmade them male and female.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>Back in the house, the disciples asked him about this again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>So he said to them,“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>Andif a womandivorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>Some people were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>When Jesus saw this, he became furious and told them,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>Truly I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>Then he picked them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and tenderly blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to him, knelt down in front of him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>Jesus said to him,“Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except for one—God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the commandments: ‘Never murder.’‘Never commit adultery.’‘Never steal.’‘Never give false testimony.’‘Never cheat.’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>The man replied to him, “Teacher, I have kept all of these since I was a young man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Jesus looked at him and loved him. Then he told him,“You're missing one thing. Go and sell everything you own, give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>But the man was shocked at this statement and went away sad, because he had many possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,“How hard it will be for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were startled by these words, but Jesus said to them again,“Children, how hard it is for those who trust in their wealthto get into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>It is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>They were utterly amazed and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Then Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>Jesus and his disciples were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were utterly amazed, and the others who followed were afraid. Once again, he took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>He asked them,“What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>They said to him, “Let us sit in your glory, one at your right and one at your left.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus told them,“You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from or be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>They told him, “We can.”Jesus said to them,“You will drink from the cup that I'm going to drink and be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right or my left. Those positions have already been prepared for others.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>When the ten heard this, they began to be furious with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>Jesus called the disciples and said to them,“You know that those who are recognized as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors act like tyrants over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>Foreven the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.49'>So Jesus stopped and said,“Call him!”So they called the blind man and told him, “Have courage! Get up. He's calling you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>He threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>Then Jesus asked him,“What do you want me to do for you?”The blind man said to him, “Rabbouni, I want to see again.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.11'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.1'>When they came near Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.2'>and said to them,“Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you go into it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat on.Untie it, and bring it along.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.5'>some men standing there asked them, “What are you doing untying that colt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>The disciples told them what Jesus had said, and the men let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their coats upon it, and he sat on it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>Then Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple and looked around at everything. Since it was already late, he went out with the twelve to Bethany.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.12'>The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>Seeing in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing except leaves because it wasn't the season for figs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>When they came to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple. He overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>So they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>“Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Haven't you ever read this Scripture:‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They were trying to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd. Realizing that he had spoken this parable against them, they left him alone and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Then they sent some Pharisees and some Herodians to him, intending to trap him in what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>But Jesus recognized their hypocrisy and said to them,“Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>So they brought one. Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”They said to him, “Caesar's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>So Jesus said to them,“Give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” And they were utterly amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, he should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without having children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>Then the second married her and died without having children, and so did the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>None of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them,“Aren't you mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when peoplerise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>As for the dead being raised, haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Then one of the scribes came near and heard them arguing with one another. He saw how well Jesus answered them, so he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of them all?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered,“The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’No other commandment is greater than these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>Then the scribe said to him, “Well said, Teacher! You have told the truth that ‘God is one, and there is no other besides him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>When Jesus saw how wisely the man answered, he told him,“You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one dared to ask him another question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said,“How can the scribes say that the Christis David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemies under your feet.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ Then how can he be his son?” And the large crowd kept listening to him with delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>As he taught, he said,“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>Theydevour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>As Jesus sat facing the offering box, he watched how the crowd was dropping their money into it. Many rich people were dropping in large amounts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>Then a destitute widow came and dropped in two small copper coins, worth about a cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>He called his disciples and said to them,“Truly I tell you, this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of those who are contributing to the offering box.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For all of them contributed out of their surplus, but she, in her poverty, has dropped in everything she had to live on.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what large stones and what beautiful buildings!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>Jesus said to him,“Do you see these large buildings? Not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives facing the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew were asking him privately,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.14'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>Now it was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and to have him put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>For they kept saying, “This must not happen during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper and sitting at the table, a woman arrived with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some who were there said to one another in irritation, “Why was the perfume wasted like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>This perfume could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute.” So they got extremely angry with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said,“Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>For you will always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>TrulyI tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the high priests to betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he began to look for a good opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>He sent two of his disciples and told them,“Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>When he goes into a house,say to its owner that the Teacher asks, ‘Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.15'>Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.16'>So the disciples left and went into the city. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.17'>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>While they were at the table eating, Jesus said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>They began to be very sad and said to him, one after the other, “Surely I am not the one, am I?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>He said to them,“It's one of you twelve, the one who is dipping his bread into the bowl with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to them, saying,“Take some. This is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.24'>He said to them,“This is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.25'>Truly I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.26'>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.29'>But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today, this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>But Peter kept saying emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the others kept saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,“Sit down here while I pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>So he said to them,“I am deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>Going on a little farther, he fell to the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>He kept repeating,“Abba!Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>When he went back, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“Simon, are you asleep? You couldn't stay awake for one hour, could you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy. They didn't even know what they should say to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>He came back a third time and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Enough of that! The time has come. Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests, the scribes, and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him, and lead him safely away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi,”, and kissed him tenderly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>Then the men took hold of Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>But one of those standing there drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>Jesus said to them,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, yet you didn't arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>A certain young man was following Jesus. He was wearing nothing but a linen sheet. They grabbed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>but he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>Then they took Jesus to the high priest. All the high priests, elders, and scribes had gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He was sitting with the servants and warming himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for some testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death, but they couldn't find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>Although many people gave false testimony against him, their testimony didn't agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>“We ourselves heard him say,‘I will destroy this sanctuary made by humanhands, and in three days I will build another one not made by humanhands.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But even on this point their testimony didn't agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he kept silent and didn't answer at all. The high priest asked him again, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>Jesus said,“I am. And‘you will see the Son of Manseated at the right hand of the Power’and‘coming with the clouds of heaven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard his blasphemy! What is your verdict?” All of them condemned him as deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and kept hitting him with their fists and telling him, “Prophesy!” Even the servants took him and slapped him around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>While Peter was down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's servant girls came by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>When she saw Peter warming himself, she glared at him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, “I don't know or understand what you're talking about.” Then he went out into the entryway. Just then a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>The servant girl saw him and again said to those who were standing around, “This man is one of them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>Again he denied it.After a little while the people who were standing there began to say to Peter again, “Obviously you're one of them, because you are a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know this man you're talking about!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>Just then a rooster crowed a second time.Peter remembered that Jesus said to him,“Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” Then he broke down and cried.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>As soon as it was morning, the high priests convened a meeting with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. They bound Jesus with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus answered him,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>The high priests kept accusing him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>So Pilate asked him again, “Don't you have any answer? Look how many accusations they're bringing against you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>At every festival Pilate would release any one prisoner whom the people requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>Now there was a man in prison named Barabbas. He was with the insurgents who had committed murder during the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>So the crowd came and began to request that he do for them what he always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the high priests had handed him over because of jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>So Pilate said to them again, “Then what should I do with the man you call the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They shouted back, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters) and called out the whole guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, and placed it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>They began to greet him, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, kneeling in front of him, and worshiping him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>They forced a certain passer-by who was coming in from the country to carry Jesus’ cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he wouldn't take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>The written notice of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>They crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself and come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, “He saved others but can't save himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now so that we may see it and believe.” Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>At twelve noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He's calling for Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink, saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>The curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>When the centurion who stood facing Jesus saw how he had cried out and breathed his last, he said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>Pilate wondered if Jesus had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down, and wrapped it in the cloth. Then he laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had just come up, they were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>They kept saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. (For it was a very large stone.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, “Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go and tell his disciples, especially Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>So they left the tomb and ran away, for shock and astonishment had overwhelmed them. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>After Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told those who had been with him and who now were grieving and crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>When they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this, he appeared in a different form to two disciples as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>They went back and told the others, who didn't believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Finally he appeared to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>Then he said to them,“As you go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who doesn't believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>“These are the signs that will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they will pick up snakes in their hands;even if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them; and they will place their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>The disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the signs that accompanied it.</verse>
