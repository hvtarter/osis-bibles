      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <title>But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.</title>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in Philippi who are united with Christ Jesus, with their overseers and deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God every time I remember you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>I am convinced of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>For it is only right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more in full knowledge and perfect insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>so that you may be able to determine what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually turned out for the progress of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>Moreover, because of my imprisonment most of the brothers have been made confident in the Lord to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some are preaching Christ because of their envy and rivalry, while others do so because of their good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition and without sincerity, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>But what does it matter? Just this, that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and because of this I rejoice. Yes, I will continue to rejoice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>because I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>This is according to my eager expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, because of my boldness Christ will be exalted in my body, now as always, whether I live or die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me, to go on living is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>Now if I go on living in this body, that will produce more results, yet I do not know which I would prefer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with Christ, for that is far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But for your sake it is better that I remain in this body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>Then your boasting in Christ Jesus will increase along with mine through my coming again to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved—and all because of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For you have been given the privilege for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion and sympathy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>then fill me with joy by having the same attitude, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and keeping one purpose in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Do not act out of selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility think of others as being better than yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Do not be concerned about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Have the same attitude among yourselves that was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>In God's own form existed he,And shared with God equality,Deemed nothing needed grasping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>Instead, poured out in emptiness,A servant's form did he possess,A mortal man becoming.	In human form he chose to be,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And lived in all humility,Death on a cross obeying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Now lifted up by God to heaven,A name above all others given,This matchless name possessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>And so, when Jesus’ name is called,The knees of everyone should fallWhere'er they are residing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>Then every tongue in one accord,Will say that Jesus Christ is Lord,While God the Father praising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do everything without complaining or arguing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>as you hold out the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know his proven worth—how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need—back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and make sure you honor such people highly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>So then, my brothers, keep on rejoicing in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For it is we who are the circumcision—we who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>As far as zeal is concerned, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as the righteousness that is in the law is concerned, I was perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>What is more, I continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>I want to know Christ—what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it. But this one thing I do: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my dear brothers whom I long for, my joy and my victor's crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to have the same attitude in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women. They have struggled with me in the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again: Keep on rejoicing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your forbearing spirit be known to all people.The Lord is near:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Likewise, keep practicing these things: what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I am looking for the profit that accumulates to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen.</verse>
