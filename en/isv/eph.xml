        <title>Let us stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another.</title>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, to his holy and faithful people in Ephesus who are in union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in his presence. In love</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>he predestined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>so that we would praise his glorious grace that he gave us in the Beloved One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our offenses, according to the riches of God's grace</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>that he lavished on us, along with all wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>when he made known to us the secret of his will. This was according to his plan that he set forth in Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>to usher in the fullness of the times and to gather up all things in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In Christ we were also chosen when we were predestined according to the purpose of the one who does everything according to the intention of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>so that we who had already fixed our hope on Christ might live for his praise and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>You, too, have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed in him you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of God's own possession, to his praise and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Therefore, because I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation through knowing Christ fully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>Then, with the eyes of your hearts enlightened, you will know the hope of his calling, the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and the unlimited greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his mighty strength,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he put to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>He is far above every ruler, authority, power, dominion, and every name that can be named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>God has put everything under his feet and has made him the head of everything for the good of the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills everything in every way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>You used to be dead because of your offenses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you once lived according to the ways of this present world and according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now active in those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>Indeed, all of us once behaved like them in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and senses. By nature we deserved wrath, just like everyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even when we were dead because of our offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>so that in the coming ages he might display the limitless riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by such grace you have been saved through faith. This does not come from you; it is the gift of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>and not the result of works, lest anyone boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared long ago to be our way of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles by birth and were called “the uncircumcision” by what is called “the circumcision” made in the flesh by hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>At that time you were without Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise. You had no hope and were in the world without God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For it is he who is our peace. In his flesh he made both groups one by tearing down the wall of hostility that divided them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>He rendered the law inoperative, along with its commandments and regulations, so that he might create in himself one new humanity from the two, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, on which he killed the hostility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>He came and proclaimed peace for you who were far away and for you who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him, both of us have access to the Father in one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>That is why you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>In him the whole building is joined together and rises into a holy sanctuary in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>You, too, are being built in him along with the others into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>Surely you have heard about the responsibility of administering God's grace that was given to me on your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>and how this secret was made known to me through a revelation, just as I wrote about briefly in the past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>By reading this, you will be able to grasp my understanding of the secret about Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in previous generations was not made known to human beings as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>The Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of what was promised in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>I have become a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given so that I might proclaim to the Gentiles the immeasurable wealth of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and help everyone see how this secret, which was hidden for ages in God who created all things, has been at work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>He did this so that now, through the church, the wisdom of God in all its variety might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>in keeping with the eternal purpose that God carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and confident access through his faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>So then, I ask you not to become discouraged because of my troubles on your behalf, which are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>This is the reason I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>I pray that he would give you, according to his glorious riches, strength in your inner being and power through his Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>and that Christ would make his home in your hearts through faith. Then, having been rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>you will be able to understand, along with all the saints, what is wide, long, high, and deep—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>that is, you will know the love of Christ, which goes far beyond knowledge, and will be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to live in a way that is worthy of the calling to which you have been called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all humility and gentleness, along with patience, accepting one another in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>Do your best to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body and one Spirit. In the same way, you were called to the one hope of your calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>That is why God says,	“When he went up to the highest placehe led captives into captivityand gave gifts to people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now what does this “he went up” mean except that he also had gone down into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>The one who went down is the same one who went up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And it is he who gifted some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and still others to be pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>to perfect the saints, to do the work of ministry, and to build up the body of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until all of us are united in the faith and in the full knowledge of God's Son, and until we attain mature adulthood and the full standard of development in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>Then we will no longer be little children, tossed like waves and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, or by clever strategies that would lead us astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>Instead, by speaking the truth in love, we will grow up completely into the one who is the head, that is, into Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>in whom the whole body is united and held together by every ligament with which it is supplied. As each individual part does its job, the body's growth is promoted so that it builds itself up in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>Therefore, I tell you and insist on in the Lord not to live any longer like the Gentiles live, thinking worthless thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Since they have lost all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to sensuality and practice every kind of sexual perversion without restraint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>However, that is not the way you came to know Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>Surely you have listened to him and have been taught by him, since truth is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>Regarding your former way of life, you were taught to strip off your old man, which is being ruined by its deceptive desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and to clothe yourselves with the new man, which was created according to the likeness of God in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, stripping off falsehood, “let each of us speak the truth to his neighbor,” for we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>and do not give the devil an opportunity to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>The thief must no longer steal but must work hard and do what is good with his own hands, so that he might have something to give to the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no filthy talk come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up as the need may be. This way you will give grace to those who hear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, quarreling, and slander be put away from you, along with all hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another just as God has forgiven you in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>So be imitators of God, as his dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>Live in love as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and sacrifice, a fragrant aroma to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>Do not let sexual sin, impurity of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>Obscene, flippant, or vulgar talk is totally inappropriate. Instead, let there be thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For you know very well that no immoral or impure person, or anyone who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Do not let anyone deceive you with meaningless words, for it is because of these things that God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>So do not be partners with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>For the fruit of the light consists of every form of goodness, righteousness, and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Determine what pleases the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>and have nothing to do with the unfruitful works of darkness. Instead, expose them for what they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is shameful even to mention what is done by people in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But everything that is exposed to the light becomes visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>for everything that is visible is light. That is why it says,	“Wake up, O sleeper!Arise from the dead,And Christ will shine on you.’’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>So, then, be careful how you live. Do not be unwise but wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>making the best use of time because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>Stop getting drunk with wine, which leads to wild living, but keep on being filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>Then you will recite to one another psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. You will sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>You will always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>And you will submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is he who is the Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Indeed, just as the church is submissive to Christ, so wives must be submissive to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>so that he might make it holy by cleansing it, washing it with water and the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>and might present the church to himself in all its glory, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind, but holy and without fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>In the same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as Christ does the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are parts of his body—of his flesh and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>“That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great secret, but I am talking about Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>“Honor your father and mother.” This is a very important commandment with a promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>“So that it may go well for you, and that you may have a long life on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>Fathers, do not make your children angry, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear, with trembling, and along with sincerity, as when you obey Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>Do not do this only while being watched in order to please them, but be like slaves of Christ who do God's will from the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>Serve willingly, as if you were serving the Lord and not merely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>For you know that everyone will receive a reward from the Lord for whatever good he has done, whether he is a slave or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>Masters, treat your slaves the same way. Do not threaten them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the devil's strategies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For our struggle is not against a human opponent, but against rulers, against authorities, against cosmic powers in the darkness around us, against evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>For this reason, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to take a stand in that evil day. And when you have done everything you could, you will be able to stand firm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand firm, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and having put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to proclaim the gospel of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>In addition to all of these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>also take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and request there is. For the same reason be alert with every kind of effort and request for all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.19'>Pray also for me, so that, when I open my mouth, the right words will be given to me. Then I will boldly make known the secret of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.20'>for whose sake I am an ambassador in chains, desiring to declare it as boldly as I should.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.21'>So that you may know what has happened to me and how I am doing, Tychicus, our dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything.</verse>
