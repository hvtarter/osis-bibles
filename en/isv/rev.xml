        <title>Instead, I hope to see you soon and talk face to face.May peace be with you! Your friends greet you. Greet each of our friends by name.</title>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the things that must happen soon. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified to what he saw: the word of God and the testimony about Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>How blessed is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it, for the time is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>From John to the seven churches in Asia. May grace and peace be yours from the one who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven spirits who are in front of his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the witness, the faithful one, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father, be glory and power forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Look! He is coming in the clouds.Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him,and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him.So be it! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” declares the Lord God, the one who is, who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I am John, your brother and partner in suffering, ruling, and enduring because of Jesus. I was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord, when I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying,“Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>Then I turned to see the voice that was talking to me, and when I turned I saw seven gold lampstands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>Among the lampstands there was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold belt around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hair were white like wool, in fact, as white as snow. His eyes were like flames of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>his feet were like glowing bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of raging waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines with full force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. But he placed his right hand on me and said,“Stop being afraid! I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>the living one. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever! I have the keys of Death and Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Therefore, write down what you have seen, what is, and what is going to happen after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The secret meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands is this: the seven stars are the messengersof the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>“To the messengerof the church in Ephesus, write:‘The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands, says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>‘I know your works, your toil, and your endurance. I also know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not, and have found them to be false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>You have endured and suffered because of my name, yet you have not grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>However, I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Therefore, remember how far you have fallen. Repent, and do the works you did at first. If you don't, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this is to your credit: You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To everyone who conquers I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>“To the messengerof the church in Smyrna, write:‘The first and the last, who was dead and became alive, says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>‘I know your suffering, your poverty—though you are rich—and the slander on the part of those who claim to be Jews but aren't. They are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Don't be afraid of what you are going to suffer. Look! The devil is going to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested. For ten days you will undergo suffering. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the victor's crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be hurt by the second death.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>“To the messengerof the church in Pergamum, write:‘The one who holds the sharp, two-edged sword, says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>‘I know where you live. Satan's throne is there. Yet you hold on to my name and have not denied your faith in me,even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed in your presence, where Satan lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you: You have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, the one who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>You also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>So repent. If you don't, I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone. On the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the person who receives it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>“To the messengerof the church in Thyatira, write:‘The Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire and whose feet are like glowing bronze, says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>‘I know your works—your love, faithfulness,service, and endurance—and that your last works are greater than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and who teaches and leads my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>Igave her time to repent, but she refused to repent of her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Look! I am going to throw her into a sickbed. Those who commit adultery with her will also have great suffering, unless they repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will reward each of you as your works deserve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>‘But as for the rest of you in Thyatira—you who do not hold on to this teaching and who have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan—I won't lay on you any other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Just hold on to what you have until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>To the person who conquers and continues to do my works to the end I will give authority over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>He will rule them with an iron scepter, as when clay pots are shattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>Just as I have received authority from my Father, I will also give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>“To the messengerof the church in Sardis, write:‘The one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this:‘I know your works. You are known for being alive, but you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be alert, and strengthen the things that are left, which are about to die. I have not found your works to be completed in the sight of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>So remember what you received and heard. Obey it, and repent. If you are not alert, I will come like a thief, and you won't know the time when I will come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me in white clothes because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>The person who conquers in this way will wear white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge his name in the presence of my Father and his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>“To the messengerof the church in Philadelphia, write:‘The one who is holy, who is true,who has the key of David,	who opens a door thatno one can shut,and who shuts a door thatno one can open,says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>‘I know your works. Look! I have put in front of you an open door that no one can shut. You have only a little strength, but you have kept my word and have not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>I will make those who belong to the synagogue of Satan—those who claim to be Jews and aren't, but are lying—come and bow down at your feet. Then they will realize that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Becauseyou have kept my command to endure,I will keep you from the hour of testing that is coming to the whole world to test those living on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming soon! Hold on to what you have so that no one takes your victor's crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>I will make the one who conquers a pillar in the sanctuary of my God, and he will never go out of it again. I will write on him the name of my God, the name of the city of my God (the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God), and my own new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>“To the messengerof the church in Laodicea, write:‘The Amen, the witness who is faithful and true, the beginningof God's creation, says this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>‘I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Since you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to spit you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>You say, “I am rich. I have become wealthy. I don't need anything.” Yet you don't realize that you are miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>Therefore, I advise you to buy from me gold purified in fire so that you may be rich, white clothes to wear so that you may keep the shame of your nakedness from showing, and ointment to put on your eyes so that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>I correct and discipline those whom I love, so be serious and repent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone listens to my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eatwith me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To the one who conquers I will give a place to sit with me on my throne, just as I have conquered and have sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.’”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I saw a door standing open in heaven. The first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said,“Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven with a person seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>The person sitting there looked like jasper and carnelian, and there was a rainbow around the throne that looked like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders wearing white robes and gold victor's crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>Flashes of lightning, noises, and peals of thunder came from the throne. Burning in front of the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center of the throne and on each side of the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a human, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were full of eyes inside and out. Without stopping day or night they were singing,	“Holy, holy, holyis the Lord God Almighty,who was, who is, and who is coming.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders bow down in front of the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They throw their victor's crowns in front of the throne and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,to receive glory, honor, and power,because you created all things,				and they came into existence				and were created because of your will.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>Then I saw in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>I also saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>I began to cry bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop crying. Look! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered. He can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>Then I saw a lamb standing in the middle of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. He looked like he had been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>When the lamb had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down in front of him. Each held a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>They sang a new song:	“You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals,because you were slaughtered.	With your blood you purchased people for Godfrom every tribe, language, people, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>You made them a kingdom and priests for our God,and they will reign on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels, the living creatures, and the elders surrounding the throne. They numbered ten thousands times ten thousand and thousands times thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>They sang with a loud voice,	“Worthy is the lamb who was slaughteredto receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying,	“To the one who sits on the throne and to the lambbe praise, honor, glory, and powerforever and ever!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!”, and the elders bowed down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>Then I saw the lamb open the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>Then I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow, and a victor's crown had been given to him. He went out as a conqueror to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Go!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a scale in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, or three quarts of barley for a denarius. But don't damage the olive oil or the wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I looked, and there was a pale horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They cried out in a loud voice, “Holy and true Sovereign, how long will it be before you judge and take revenge on those living on the earth who shed our blood?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they had been killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree drops its fruit when it is shaken by a strong wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>They said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to endure it?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>I saw another angel coming from the east having the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been permitted to harm the land and sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>“Don't harm the land, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000. Those who were sealed were from every tribe of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, and 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After these things I looked, and there was a large crowd that no one was able to count! They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb and were wearing white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>They cried out in a loud voice,	“Salvation belongs to our God,who sits on the throne,and to the lamb!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>saying,	“Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strengthbe to our God forever and ever! Amen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the elders said to me, “Who are these people wearing white robes, and where did they come from?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>I said to him, “Sir, you know.”Then he told me, “These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>That is why:	“They are in front of the throne of Godand worship him night and day in his temple.	The one who sits on the throne will shelter them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They will never be hungry or thirsty again.Neither the sun nor any burning heat will ever strike them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>for the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd.	He will lead them to springs filled with the water of life,and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When the lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels who stand in God's presence, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel came with a gold censer and stood at the altar. He was given a large quantity of incense to offer on the gold altar before the throne, along with the prayers of all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The smoke from the incense and the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there were peals of thunder, noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood and thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star blazing like a torch fell from heaven. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from the water because it had turned bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. One-third of the day was kept from shining, and also the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying overhead say in a loud voice, “How terrible, how terrible, how terrible for those living on the earth, because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>It opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the shaft like the smoke from a large furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like the power of earthly scorpions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree. They could harm only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>They were not allowed to kill them, but were only allowed to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the pain of a scorpion when it stings someone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days people will look for death and never find it. They will long to die, but death will escape them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were victor's crowns that looked like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>They had hair like women's hair and teeth like lions’ teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>They had breastplates like iron, and the noise of their wings was like the roar of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They had tails and stingers like scorpions, and they had the power to hurt people with their tails for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>They had the angel of the bottomless pit ruling over them as king. In Hebrew he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first catastrophe is over. After these things there are still two more catastrophes to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are held at the great Euphrates River.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels who were ready for that hour, day, month, and year were released to kill one-third of humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The number of cavalry troops was 200,000,000. I heard how many there were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>This was how I saw the horses in my vision: The riders wore breastplates that had the color of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths—one-third of humanity was killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of these horses is in their mouths and their tails. Their tails have heads like snakes, which they use to inflict pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>The rest of the people who survived these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>They did not repent of their murders, their deeds of witchcraft, their acts of sexual immorality, or their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>Then I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don't write it down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, the secret of God will be fulfilled, as he had announced to his servants, the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go and take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>So I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>Then the seven thunders told me, “Again you must prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>Then I was given a stick like a measuring rod. I was told, “Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the Holy City for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>I will give my two witnesses who wear sackcloth the authority to prophesy for 1,260 days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>And if anyone should want to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the days of their prophesying. They also have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>For three and a half days some members of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be placed in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>Those living on earth will gloat over them, celebrate, and send gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Those who watched them were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, “Come up here!” So they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe is coming very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying,	“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,and he will rule forever and ever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>Then the twenty-four elders who were sitting on their thrones in God's presence fell on their faces and worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>They said,	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,who is and who was,because you have taken your great powerand have begun to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The nations were angry,but your wrath has come.	It is time for the dead to be judged—to reward your servants, the prophets, the saints, and all who fear your name,both unimportant and important,and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his temple. There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>A spectacular sign appeared in the sky: a woman dressed with the sun, who had the moon under her feet and a victor's crown of twelve stars on her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She was pregnant and was crying out from labor pains and the agony of giving birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>Then another sign appeared in the sky: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on its heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>Its tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where a place had been prepared for her by God so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The huge dragon was thrown down. That ancient serpent, called devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and its angels were thrown down with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,	“Now the salvation, the power,the kingdom of our God,and the authority of his Christ have come.	For the one accusing our brothers,the one who accuses them day and nightin the presence of our God, has been thrown out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>They conquered him by the blood of the lamband by the word of their testimony,for they did not love their life even in the face of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>So be glad, heavens, and those who live in them!	How terrible it is for the earth and the sea,because the devil has come down to you with great wrath,knowing that his time is short!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who had given birth to the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>However, the woman was given the two wings of a large eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>From its mouth the serpent poured water like a river behind the woman in order to sweep her away with the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had poured from its mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to do battle against the rest of her children, the ones who keep God's commandments and hold on to the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and complete authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>One of the beast's heads looked like it had a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed. And in amazement the whole world followed the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>They worshiped the dragon because it had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight a war with it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>The beast was allowed to speak arrogant and blasphemous things, and it was given authority for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God and to blaspheme his name and his residence, that is, those who are living in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>It was allowed to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>All those living on earth will worship it, everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life belonging to the lamb that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.9'>Let anyone who has an ear listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>If anyone is to be taken captive,he must go into captivity.	If anyone is to be killed with a sword,he must be killed with a sword.This is what the endurance and faith of the saints means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it talked like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>It uses all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and those living on it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>It performs spectacular signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>It deceives those living on earth with the signs that it is allowed to do on behalf of the first beast, telling them to make an image for the beast who was wounded by a sword and yet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>The second beast was allowed to give breath to the image of the first beast so that the image of the beast could talk and put to death those who would not worship the image of the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>The second beast forces all people—important and unimportant, rich and poor, free and slaves—to be marked on their right hands or on their foreheads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.17'>so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the beast's name or the number of its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.18'>This calls for wisdom: Let the person who has understanding figure out the number of the beast, because it is the number of a person. Its number is 666.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>Then I looked, and there was the lamb standing on Mount Zion! With him were 144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>Then I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>They have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among humanity as the first fruits for God and the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.5'>In their mouth no lie was found. They are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.6'>Then I saw another angel flying overhead with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.7'>He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.8'>Then another angel, a second one, followed him, saying, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all the nations drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.9'>Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or his hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.10'>will drink the wine of God's wrath, which has been poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. He will be tortured with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.11'>The smoke from their torture goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.12'>Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and hold on to the faithfulness of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.13'>I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: How blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!”“Yes,” says the Spirit. “Let them rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.14'>Then I looked, and there was a white cloud! On the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man, with a gold victor's crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.15'>Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest, for the hour has come to gather it, because the harvest on the earth is fully ripe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.16'>The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.17'>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.18'>From the altar came another angel who had authority over fire. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.19'>So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the grapes from the earth and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.20'>The wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the wine press as high as a horse's bridle for 200 miles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.1'>I saw another sign in heaven. It was spectacular and amazing. There were seven angels with the seven last plagues. With them God's wrath has come to its completion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those who had conquered the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing on the sea of glass holding God's harps in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>They sang the song of God's servant Moses and the song of the lamb:	“Your deeds are spectacular and amazing, Lord God Almighty.	Your ways are just and true, King of the nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. A horrible, painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured his bowl into the sea. It became like the blood of a dead body, and every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>Then I heard the angel of the water say,	“You are just. You are the one who isand who was, the Holy One,because you have judged these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>You have given them blood to drinkbecause they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets.This is what they deserve.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>Then I heard the altar reply,	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,your judgments are true and just.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. It was allowed to burn people with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>and they were burned by the fierce heat. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>Then I saw three disgusting spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>They are demonic spirits that perform signs. They go to the kings of the whole earth and gather them for the war of the great day of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>“See, I am coming like a thief. How blessed is the person who remains alert and keeps his clothes on! He won't have to go naked and let others see his shame.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>The spirits gathered the kings at the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple and said, “It has happened!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since people have been on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine filled with the fury of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>Huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky on people. They cursed God because the plague of hail was such a terrible plague.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those living on earth became drunk with the wine of her immorality.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was filled with blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>The woman wore purple and scarlet clothes and was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls. In her hand she was holding a gold cup filled with detestable things and the impurities of her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>On her forehead was written a secret name:BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND DETESTABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. I was very surprised when I saw her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>The angel said to me, “Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret of the woman and the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that you saw once was, is no longer, and is going to come from the bottomless pit and go to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be surprised when they see the beast because it was, is no longer, and will come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is sitting. They are also seven kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>Five of them have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>The beast that was and is no longer is the eighth king, but it belongs with the seven kings and goes to its destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. They will receive authority to rule as kings with the beast for one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>They have one purpose: to give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>They will wage war against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>The angel also said to me, “The waters you saw, on which the prostitute is sitting, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will leave her abandoned and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose. And so they will give their kingdom to the beast until God's words are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was made bright by his splendor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,	“Come out of her, my people,so that you don't participate in her sinsand suffer from her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>For her sins are piled as high as heaven,and God has remembered her crimes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>Just as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,so give her just as much torture and misery.	In her heart she says,‘I am a queen on a throne, not a widow.I will never see misery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>For this reason her plagues of death, misery, and famine will come in a single day.	She will be burned up in a fire,because powerful is the Lord God who judges her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality with her and lived in luxury with her, will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rising from her fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>Frightened by her torture, they will stand far away and say,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for that great city,the powerful city Babylon!For in one hour your judgment has come!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>The merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all articles made of ivory, all articles made of very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and slaves (that is, human souls).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>“The fruit for which your soul craved has left you.All your dainties and your splendor are lost to you. No one will ever find them again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>Frightened by her torture, the merchants of these wares who had become rich from her will stand far away. They will cry and mourn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>saying,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great citythat was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarletand was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>For in one hour all this wealth has been destroyed!”Every ship's captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made a living by the sea stood far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>When they saw the smoke from her fire, they began to cry out, “What city was like the great city?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city,where all who had ships at sea became richbecause of her wealth!		For in one hour she has been destroyed!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,	“The great city Babylon will be thrown down with violent force—and will never be found again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeterswill never be heard in you again.	No artisan of any tradewill ever be found in you again.	The sound of a millstonewill never be heard in you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>The light from a lamp will never shine in you again.	The voice of a bridegroom and bridewill never be heard in you again.	For your merchants were the important people of the world,and all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>The blood of prophets, saints, and all who had been murderedon earth was found in her.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a large crowd in heaven, saying,	“Hallelujah!	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, “Amen! Hallelujah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>A voice came from the throne, saying,	“Praise our God,all who serve and fear him,from the least importantto the most important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying,	“Hallelujah!The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us rejoice, be glad, and give him glory,because the marriage of the lamb has comeand his bride has made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>She has been given the privilege of wearing fine linen,dazzling and pure.”(The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>Then the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘How blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb!’” He also told me, “These are the true words of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>I bowed down at his feet to worship him, but he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold on to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw heaven standing open, and there was a white horse! Its rider is named Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and wages war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many royal crowns. He has a name written on him that nobody knows except himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come! Gather for the great supper of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>Eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, both unimportant and important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf. By these signs the false prophet had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>The rest were killed by the sword that belonged to the rider on the horse and that came from his mouth. And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>He threw him into the bottomless pit, locked it, and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set free for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>How blessed and holy are those who participate in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God and Christ, and will rule with him for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be freed from his prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>He will go out to deceive Gog and Magog, the nations at the four corners of the earth, and gather them for war. They are as numerous as the sands of the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>They marched over the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. Fire came from God out of heaven and burned them up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were. They will be tortured day and night forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>Then I saw a large, white throne and the one who was sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>I saw the dead, both unimportant and important, standing in front of the throne, and books were open. Another book was opened—the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their works, as recorded in the books.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. (This is the second death—the lake of fire.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.21'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the sea was gone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>It had a large, high wall with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb were written on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>The city was square: its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia long. Its length, width, and height were the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>He also measured its wall. According to the human measurement that the angel was using it was 144 cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>Its wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each gate was made of a single pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>I saw no temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light, because the glory of God gave it light, and the lamb was its lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
