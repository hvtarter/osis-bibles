        <title>And this is the commandment that we have from him: the person who loves God must also love his brother.</title>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>From the elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I was overjoyed to find some of your children living in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>I am now requesting you, dear lady, that we continue to love each other. It is not as though I am writing to give you a new commandment, but one that we have had from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love: that we live according to his commandments. This is his commandment, just as you have heard it from the beginning. You must live by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone out into the world. They refuse to acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. Any such person is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>See to it that you don't destroy what we have worked for, but that you receive your full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ but goes beyond it does not have God. The person who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your home or even greet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for the one who greets him shares in his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Although I have a great deal to write to you, I would prefer not to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your chosen sister greet you.</verse>
