      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <title>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance:	To this world Christ Jesus came,Sinful people to reclaim.I am the worst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King Eternal—the immortal, invisible, and only God—be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>First of all, then, I urge you to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of thanks for all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings, and for everyone who has authority, so that we might lead a quiet and peaceful life with all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who wants all people to be saved and to come to a full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and human beings—a human, Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>He gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact that was acknowledged at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>For this reason I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>Therefore, I want the men to offer prayers in every place, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but through good works. This is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>A woman must learn quietly with full submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This saying is trustworthy:	The one who would an elder be,		A noble task desires he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>Therefore, an elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, stable, sensible, respectable, a lover of strangers, and teachable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but instead be gentle. He must not be argumentative or a lover of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>He must not be a recent convert, or he might become arrogant and fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>He must be well thought of by outsiders, lest he fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Deacons, too, must be serious. They must not be two-faced, addicted to wine, or greedy for money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>They must hold firmly to the secret of the faith with clear consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>But they must first be tested. Then, if they prove to be blameless, they may become deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Their wives must also be serious. They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Deacons must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>in case I am delayed so that you may know how one is to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great:	In flesh was he revealed to sight,Kept righteous by the Spirit's might,Adored by angels singing.	To nations was he manifest,Believing souls found peace and rest,Our Lord in heaven reigning!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Now the Spirit says clearly that in the last times some people will abandon the faith by following deceitful spirits, the teachings of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>and the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences have been burned by a hot iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>They will try to stop people from marrying and from eating certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For everything God created is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you continue to point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the healthy teaching that you have followed closely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>Do not have anything to do with godless myths and fables of old women, but train yourself in godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>Physical exercise is of limited value, but	Godliness is very dear,A pledge of life, both there and here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>To this end we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, that is, of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These are the things you must insist on and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for other believers in your speech, behavior, love, faithfulness, and purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I arrive, concentrate on the public reading of Scripture, on exhorting, and on teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, accompanied by the laying on of the elders’ hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Think on these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Pay close attention to your life and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for if you do this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, with absolutely purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents, for this is pleasing in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>A woman who is really a widow and is left all alone has placed her hope in God and devotes herself to petitions and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Continue to give these instructions so that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>A widow may be put on the widows' list if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>She must be well known for her good works as a woman who has raised children, welcomed strangers, washed the saints’ feet, helped the suffering, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But do not include younger widows on your list. For whenever their natural desires cause them to lose their devotion to Christ, they want to remarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>They receive condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>At the same time, they also learn how to be lazy while going from house to house. Not only this, but they even become gossips and keep busy by interfering in other people's lives, saying things they should not say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>Therefore, I want younger widows to remarry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. The church should not be burdened so that it can help those who really are widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Elders who handle their duties well should be considered worthy of double compensation, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out grain,” and“A worker deserves his pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>As for those who keep on sinning, rebuke them in front of everyone so that the others will also be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>In the sight of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, I solemnly call on you to carry out these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not ordain anyone hastily. Do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Stop drinking only water, but use a little wine for your stomach because of your frequent illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The sins of some people are obvious, going ahead of them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In the same way, good works are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their own masters as deserving of the highest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>Moreover, those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are fellow believers. Instead, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the healthy words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we did not bring anything into the world, and surely we cannot take anything out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>So as long as we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with much pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep your hold on eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>to keep this command stainless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>At the right time God will make him known. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Tell those who are rich in the present world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and to share.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can take hold of the life that is real.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!</verse>
