      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <title>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</title>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many people have attempted to write an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they were passed down to us by those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>I, too, have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and have decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, and they lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting on in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>When Zechariah was serving with his division of priests in God's presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>When Zechariah saw him, he was shaken, and fear overwhelmed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, “Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>You will have joy and gladness, and many people will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He is the one who will go before the Lord with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time, you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When the days of his service were over, he went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>“This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>She was startled by his statement and tried to figure out what his greeting meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>Then the angel told her, “Stop being afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Mary asked the angel, “How can this be, since I have not had relations with a man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will cover you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for the woman who was said to be barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For nothing is impossible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, “Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me.” Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>At this time Mary set out hurriedly for a Judean city in the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and exclaimed with a loud cry, “How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said,	“My soul praises the greatness of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>My spirit exults in God, my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>for he has looked favorably on his humble servant.	From now on, all generations will call me blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>because the Almighty has done great things for me.His name is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>His mercy lasts from generation to generationfor those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He displayed his mighty power with his arm.	He scattered people who were proud in mind and heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He pulled powerful rulers from their thronesand lifted up humble people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He filled hungry people with good thingsand sent rich people away with nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He helped his servant Israel,remembering to be merciful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>according to the promise he made to our ancestors—to Abraham and his descendants forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>but his mother said, “Absolutely not! He must be named John.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>Their friends said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they motioned to the baby's father to see what he wanted to name him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And everyone was amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Suddenly, Zechariah's mouth was opened, his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All who heard about it debated in their minds what had happened and said, “What will this child become?” For it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel!He has taken care of his people and has set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>He has raised up a mighty Savior for usfrom the family of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>just as he promised long ago		through the mouth of his holy prophets</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that he would save us from our enemiesand from the grip of all who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>He has shown mercy to our ancestorsand remembered his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.	He granted us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>deliverance from our enemies' gripso that we could serve him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>and be holy and righteous before him all of our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.	For you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his ways</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>and to give his people the knowledge of salvationthrough the forgiveness of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Because of the tender mercy of our God,the dawn from on high has broken upon us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to shine on those who sit in darkness and in death's shadow,and to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>Now the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit. He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first registration taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>So all the people went to their hometowns to be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph, too, went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was a descendant of the household and family of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>He went there to be registered with Mary, who had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there, the time came for her to have her baby,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was not any room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>Then the angel said to them, “Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>Suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>“Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>but Mary continued to treasure in her heart all these things and to ponder them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the shepherds returned to their flock, glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>After eight days had passed, the child was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>“Master, now you are allowing your servant to leave in peaceaccording to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which you prepared for all people to see—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light that will reveal salvation to the Gentiles		and bring glory to your people Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>Jesus’ father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall or rise. He will be a sign that will be disputed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed. Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and then as a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>After doing everything required by the law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>When the days of the festival were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>They thought that he was in the group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>Three days later they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He said to them,“Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand what he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth; and he remained in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing in wisdom and maturity, and in favor with God and his fellow man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>John went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled,and every mountain and hill will be leveled.	The crooked ways will be made straight,and the rough roads will be made smooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>Everyone will see the salvationthat God has provided.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>The crowds kept asking him, “What, then, should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered them, “The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>He told them, “Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Even some soldiers were asking him, “And what should we do?”He told them, “Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John replied to all of them, “I am baptizing you with water, but the one who is stronger than I am is coming, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>With many other exhortations John continued to proclaim the good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John because he had married his brother's wife Herodias and because of all the evil things Herod had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>Added to all this, Herod locked John up in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>When all the people had been baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan. He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>where he was being tempted by the devil for forty days. During those days he ate nothing at all, and when they were over he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>Jesus answered him,“It is written,‘One must not live on bread alone,but on every word of God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>The devil also took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>He said to Jesus, “I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms. For it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>So if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>But Jesus answered him,“It is written,‘You must worship the Lord your Godand serve only him.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>The devil also took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of youto watch over you carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>Jesus answered him,“It has been said,‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, he left him until another time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit. Meanwhile, the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>He began to teach in their synagogues and was continuously receiving praise from everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been raised. As was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. When he stood up to read,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,because he has anointed me to tellthe good news to the poor.	He has sent me to announce release to the prisonersand recovery of sight to the blind,to set oppressed people free,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>and to announce the year of the Lord's favor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>Then he began to say to them,“Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>All the people began to speak well of him and to wonder at the gracious words that flowed from his mouth. They said, “This is Joseph's son, isn't it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>So he said to them,“You will probably quote this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, heal yourself! Do all the things here in your hometown that we hear you did in Capernaum.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>He added,“Truly I tell you, a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>In truth I tell you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the heaven was closed for three years and six months and there was a severe famine everywhere in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>Yet Elijah wasn't sent to a single one of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>There were also many lepers in Israel in the prophet Elisha's time, yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>All the people in the synagogue became furious when they heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>They got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him off of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he walked right through the middle of them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and began teaching the people on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>They were utterly amazed at his teaching, because his message was spoken with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>In the synagogue was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. He screamed with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>“Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying,“Be quiet, and come out of him!” At this, the demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out of him without hurting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>Amazement came on all of them, and they kept saying to one another, “What kind of statement is this? For with authority and power he tells the unclean spirits what to do, and they come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>So news about him spread to every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>Then Jesus got up to leave the synagogue and went into Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, so they asked Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>He bent over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began serving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>When the sun was setting, all those who had any friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and began healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Even demons came out of many people, screaming, “You are the Son of God!” But Jesus rebuked them and ordered them not to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>At daybreak he left and went to a deserted place, while the crowds kept looking for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them,“I have to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also, for that is what I was sent to do.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>One day as the crowd was pressing in on him to listen to God's word, Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He saw two boats lying on the shore, but the fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>So Jesus got into one of the boats (the one that belonged to Simon) and asked him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,“Push out into deep water, and lower your nets for a catch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, “Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>After the men had done this, they caught so many fish that the nets began to tear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats until the boats began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees and said, “Leave me, Lord! I am a sinful man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For Simon and all the people who were with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners.Then Jesus said to Simon,“Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>So when they brought the boats to shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>One day while Jesus was in one of the cities, a man covered with leprosy saw Jesus and fell on his face, begging him, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying,“I do want to. Be made clean!” Instantly the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>Then Jesus ordered him,“Don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the news about Jesus spread even more, and many crowds began gathering to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>However, he continued his habit of retiring to deserted places and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law happened to be sitting near by. The people had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Some men were bringing a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to take him into the house and place him in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>When they couldn't find a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on his stretcher through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said,“Mister,your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Because Jesus knew that they were arguing, he said to them,“Why are you arguing about this among yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Whichis easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>ButI want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“I say to you: Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>So the man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up what he had been lying on. Then he went home, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Amazement seized all the people, and they began to praise God. They were filled with fear and declared, “We have seen wonderful things today!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After that, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector's desk. He said to him,“Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>So Levi left everything behind, got up, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Then Levi gave a large banquet at his home for Jesus. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>The Pharisees and their scribes started complaining to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>But Jesus answered them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners, to repentance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Then they said to him, “John's disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do those of the Pharisees. But your disciples keep right on eating and drinking.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>But Jesus said to them,“You can't force the wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them, can you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and in those days they will fast.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>Then he told them a parable:“No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, the new will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will make the skins burst, the winewill be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine, for he says, ‘The old is excellent!’”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Once, on the second Sabbath after the first, Jesus was walking through some grainfields. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions became hungry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>How was it that he went into the house of God and took and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>Then he said to them,“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>Once, on another Sabbath, Jesus went into a synagogue and began teaching. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, in order to find a way of accusing him of doing something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the paralyzed hand,“Get up, and stand in the middle of the synagogue.” So he got up and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them,“I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>He looked around at all of them and then said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>The others were filled with fury and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>Now it was in those days that Jesus went to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>When daylight came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also called apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.14'>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholemew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.15'>Matthew, Thomas, James (the son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Judas (the son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place, along with a huge crowd of his disciples and a large gathering of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those who were being tormented by unclean spirits were being healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>The entire crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Then Jesus looked at his disciples and said,	“How blessed are you who are destitute,for the kingdom of God is yours!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>That's why I didn't presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said,“I tell you, not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant in perfect health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were going along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he approached the entrance to the city, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her. He said to her,“You can stop crying.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Then he went up and touched the open coffin, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said,“Young man, I say to you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Fear gripped everyone, and they began to praise God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us,” and “God has helped his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>John's disciples told him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that time Jesus had healed many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>So he answered them,“Go and tell John what you have observed and heard: the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear again, the dead are raised, and the destitute hear the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John.“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fine clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>Thisis the man about whom it is written,‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>All the people who heard this, including the tax collectors, acknowledged the justice of God, for they had been baptized with John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's plan for themselves by refusing to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>“To what can I compare the people of this generation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>Theyare like little children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other,‘A wedding song we played for you,the dance you did but scorn.	A woeful dirge we chanted, too,but then you did not mourn.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, yet you say, ‘He has a demon!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>Absolved from every act of sin,is wisdom by her kith and kin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So he went to the Pharisee's home and took his place at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>There was a woman who was a notorious sinner in that city. When she learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's home, she took an alabaster jar of perfume</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and knelt at his feet behind him. She was crying and began to wash his feet with her tears and dry them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet over and over again, anointing them constantly with the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who is touching him and what kind of woman she is. She's a sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus said to him,“Simon, I have something to say to you.”“Teacher,” he replied, “say it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>“Two men were in debt to a moneylender. One owed him 500 denarii,and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>When they couldn't pay it back, he generously canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him the most?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the larger debt canceled.”Jesus said to him,“You have answered correctly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon,“Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You didn't give me any water for my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You didn't give me a kiss,but this woman, from the moment I came in, has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>Youdidn't anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>So I'm telling you that her sins, as many as they are, have been forgiven, and that's why she has shown such great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Then Jesus said to her,“Your sins are forgiven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Those who were at the table with them began to say among themselves, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But Jesus said to the woman,“Your faith had saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>After this, Jesus traveled from one city and village to another, preaching and spreading the good news about God's kingdom. The twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses: Mary, also called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Joanna, the wife of Herod's household manager Chuza; Susanna; and many others. These women continued to support them out of their personal resources.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>Now while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to him from every city, he said in a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, were trampled on, and the birds of the sky ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Others fell on stony ground, and as soon as they came up, they dried up because they had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Others fell among thornbushes, and the thornbushes grew with them and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But others fell on good soil, and when they came up, they produced a hundred times as much as was planted.” As he said this, he called out,“Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>Then his disciples began to ask him what this parable meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>So he said,“You have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they are givenin parables, so that‘they might look but not see,and they might listen but not understand.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>“Now this is what the parable means. The seed is God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>The ones on the path are the people who listen, but then the devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>The ones on the stony ground are the people who welcome the word with joy when they hear it. But since they don't have any roots, they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>The ones that fell among the thornbushes are the people who listen, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries, wealth, and pleasures of life, and their fruit doesn't mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But the ones on the good soil are the people who also hear the word but hold on to it with good and honest hearts and produce a crop through endurance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>“No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in will see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing secret that will not become known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>So pay attention to how you listen. For to the one who has something, more will be given. However, from the one who doesn't have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>His mother and his brothers came to him, but they couldn't get near him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>He was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered them,“My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them,“Let's cross to the other side of the lake.” So they started out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>Now as they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A violent storm swept over the lake, and they were taking on water and were in great danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>So they went to him, woke him up, and said, “Master! Master! We're going to die!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. They stopped, and there was calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>Then he asked the disciples,“Where is your faith?”Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this man? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They landed in the region of the Gerasenes, which is just across the lake from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When Jesus stepped out on the shore, a certain man from the city met him. This man was controlled by demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he screamed, fell down in front of him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you want from me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For Jesus was in the process of ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions the unclean spirit had seized the man, and though he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into deserted places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him,“What's your name?”He answered, “Legion,” because many demons had gone into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>Then the demons began begging Jesus not to order them to go into the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now a large herd of pigs was grazing there on the hillside. So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into those pigs, and he let them do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>So the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>The people who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were terrified. So he got into a boat and started back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Jesus to let him go with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>“Go home and declare how much God has done for you.”So the man left and kept proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>When Jesus came back, the crowd welcomed him, for everyone was expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Just then a synagogue leader by the name of Jairus arrived. He fell at Jesus’ feet and kept begging him to come to his home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. While Jesus was on his way, the crowds continued to press in on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>A woman was there who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. Although she had spent all she had on doctors, no one could heal her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>She came up behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his garment, and her bleeding stopped at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus asked,“Who touched me?”While everyone was denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>Still Jesus said,“Somebody touched me, for I know that power has gone out of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>When the woman saw that she couldn't hide, she came forward trembling. Bowing down in front of him, she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched Jesus and how she had been instantly healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>He said to her,“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Stop bothering the teacher anymore.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard this, he told the synagogue leader,“Stop being afraid! Just believe, and she will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When he arrived at the house, he allowed no one to go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the child's father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>Now everyone was crying and wailing for her. But Jesus said,“Stop crying! She's not dead but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed and laughed at him, because they knew she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took her hand and called out,“Child, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>So her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he directed that she be given something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>Then he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He told them,“Don't take anything along on the trip—no walking stick, traveling bag, bread, money, or even an extra shirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>When you go into a home, stay there and leave from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>If people don't welcome you, when you leave that city, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they left and went from village to village, spreading the good news and healing diseases everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening. He was puzzled because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>by others that Elijah had appeared, and by still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, “I beheaded John. But who is this man I'm hearing so much about?” So Herod kept trying to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them away with him privately to a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the crowds found out about this and followed him. He welcomed them and began to speak to them about the kingdom of God and to heal those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>As the day was drawing to a close, the twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away to the neighboring villages and farms so they can rest and get some food, for we are here in a deserted place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them,“You give them something to eat.”They replied, “We have nothing more than five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>Now there were about 5,000 men. So he said to his disciples,“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did this and got all of them seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to the disciples to pass on to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>All of them ate and were filled. When they collected the leftover pieces, there were twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>One day while Jesus was praying privately and the disciples were with him, he asked them,“Who do the crowds say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the ancient prophets who has come back to life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He asked them,“But who do you say I am?”Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>He strictly ordered and commanded them not to tell this to anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>He said,“The Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he must be killed, but on the third day he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Then he said to all of them,“If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross every day, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>What profit will a person have if he gains the whole world, but destroys himself or is lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory ofthe Father and the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>Truly I tell you, some people who are standing here will not experience death until they see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now about eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes turned dazzling white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>Suddenly, two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>They appeared in glory and were discussing Jesus’ departure which he was about to bring to fulfillment in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and the men with him had been overcome by sleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>Just as Moses and Elijah were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (Peter didn't know what he was saying.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>But while he was saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them, and they were frightened as they went into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>Then a voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Keep listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>After the voice had spoken, Jesus was alone. The disciples kept silent and at that time told no one about what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>Suddenly a man in the crowd shouted, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>Without warning a spirit takes control of him, and he suddenly screams, goes into convulsions, and foams at the mouth. The spirit mauls him and refuses to leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus answered,“You unbelieving and perverted generation! How much longer must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>Even while the boy was coming, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>So all the people continued to be amazed at the greatness of God. Indeed, everyone was astonished at all the things Jesus was doing. So he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>“Listen carefully to these words.The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they didn't know what this meant. Indeed, the meaning was hidden from them so that they didn't understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Now an argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, knowing their inner thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>Then he said to them,“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John said, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>When the days grew closer for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, he was determined to continue his journey to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>So he sent messengers on ahead of him. On their way they went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But the people didn't welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>When his disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them, as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>While they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus told him,	“Foxes have holes and birdshave nests,but the Son of Man has no place to rest.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But he told him,“Let the dead bury their own dead. But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Still another man said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those at home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus told him,“No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>He answered, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But the man wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>After careful consideration, Jesus replied,“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of bandits. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man,he went by on the other side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>The next day he took out two denariiand gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take good care of him. If you spend more than that, I'll repay you when I come back.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>He said, “The one who showed mercy to him.”Jesus told him,“Go and do what he did.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>Now as they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>She had a sister named Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet and kept listening to what he was saying.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. After he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>Jesus was driving a demon out of a man who was unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to speak, and the crowds were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>But some of them said, “He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>Others, wanting to test Jesus, kept asking him for a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>Since he knew what they were thinking, he said to them,“Every kingdom divided against itself is devastated, and a divided household collapses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.18'>Now if Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? For you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.3'>“Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.4'>Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you seven times and says, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.5'>Then the apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.6'>The Lord replied,“If you have faith the size of amustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.7'>“Suppose a man among you has a servant plowing or watching sheep. Would he say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come at once and have something to eat’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.8'>Of course not. Instead, he would say to him, ‘Get dinner ready for me, and put on your apron and wait on me until I eat and drink. Then you can eat and drink.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.9'>He doesn't praise the servant for doing what was commanded, does he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.10'>That's the way it is with you. When you have done everything you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless servants. We have done only what we ought to have done.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.11'>One day, Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.12'>As he was going into a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.13'>and shouted, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.14'>When he saw them, he told them,“Go and show yourselves to the priests.” While they were going, they were made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.15'>But one of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back and praised God with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.16'>He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. Now the man was a Samaritan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.17'>Jesus asked,“Ten men were made clean, weren't they? Where are the other nine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.18'>Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.19'>Then he told the man,“Get up, and go home! Your faith has made you well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.20'>Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come. He answered them,“The kingdom of God is not coming with a visible display.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.21'>Peoplewon't say, ‘Look! Here it is!’ or “There it is!’ For the kingdom of God is amongyou.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.22'>Then he said to the disciples,“The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.23'>Peoplewill say to you, ‘Look! There he is!’ or ‘Look! Here he is!’ Don't go and chase after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.24'>For just as lightning flashes and shines from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.25'>But first he must suffer a great deal and be rejected by this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.26'>“Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.27'>Peoplewere eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.28'>So it was in the days of Lot. Peoplewere eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.29'>But on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.30'>The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.31'>“The person who is on the housetop that day must not come down to get the belongings out of his house. The person in the field, too, must not turn back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.32'>Remember Lot's wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.33'>Whoever tries to save his lifewill lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.34'>I tell you, two people will be in the same bed that night. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.35'>Two woman will be grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.37'>Then they asked him, “Where, Lord, will this take place?”He told them,“Wherever there's a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.18'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray all the time and never give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>He said,“In a city there was a judge who didn't fear God or respect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>For a while the judgerefused. But later he said to himself, ‘I don't fear God or respect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice. Otherwise, she will keep coming and wear me out.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>Then the Lord added,“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>Won't God grant his chosen people justice when they cry out to him day and night? Is he slow to help them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you, he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>Jesus also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves because they were righteous, but who looked down on everyone else:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘O God, I thank you that I'm not like other people—thieves, dishonest people, adulterers,or even this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of my entire income.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>“But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven. Instead, he continued to beat his chest and said, ‘O God, be merciful to me, the sinner that I am!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went down to his home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Now some people were even bringing their infants to Jesus to have him touch them. But when the disciples saw this, they sternly told the people not to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>Jesus, however, called for them and said,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>Then an official asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>Jesus said to him,“Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except for one—God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: ‘Never commit adultery.Never murder.Never steal.Never give false testimony.Honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>The official replied, “I have kept all of these since I was a young man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>When Jesus heard this, he said to him,“You still need one thing. Sell everything you have and give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when the official heard this he became sad, because he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>So when Jesus saw how sad he was, he said,“How hard it is for rich people to get into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>Those who heard him said, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>Jesus replied,“The things that are impossible for people are possible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, “See, we have left everything we have and followed you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left his home, wife, brothers, parents, or children because of the kingdom of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who will not receive many times as much in this world, as well as eternal life in the age to come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them,“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. Everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked, insulted, and spit on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>After they have whipped him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they didn't understand any of this. What he said was hidden from them, and they didn't know what he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>As Jesus was approaching Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>They told him that Jesus from Nazareth was coming by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>Then he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>The people at the front of the crowd sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>“What do you want me to do for you?”He said, “Lord, I want to see again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>Jesus told him,“Receive your sight! Your faith has made you well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>Immediately the man could see again and began to follow Jesus, glorifying God. All the people saw this and gave praise to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>As Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>a man named Zacchaeus appeared. He was a leading tax collector, and a rich one at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't do so because of the crowd. (He was short in height.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said,“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>Zacchaeus came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>But all the people who saw this began to complain, saying, “He went to be the guest of a notorious sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Lord, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor. I'll pay four times as much as I owe if I have cheated anyone in any way.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>Then Jesus said to him,“Today salvation has come to this home, because he, too, is a descendant of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>So he said,“A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins.He said to them, ‘Invest this money until I come back.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him, saying, ‘We don't want this man to rule over us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>“After he was appointed king, he came back. He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so that he could find out what they had made by investing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>The first servantcame and said, ‘Sir, your coin has earned ten more coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>The kingsaid to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>“The second servantcame and said, ‘Your coin, sir, has earned five coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>The kingsaid to him, ‘You take charge of five cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>“Then the other servantcame and said, ‘Sir, look! Here's your coin. I've kept it in a cloth for safekeeping</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>because I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You withdraw what you didn't deposit and harvest what you didn't plant.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>The kingsaid to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you evil servant! You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, and that I withdraw what I didn't deposit and harvest what I didn't plant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Then why didn't you put my money in the bank? When I returned, I could have collected it with interest.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>“So the kingtold those standing nearby, ‘Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They answered him, ‘Sir, he alreadyhas ten coins!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>‘I tell you, to everyone who has something, more will be given, but from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to be their king—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>After Jesus had said this, he traveled on and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>When he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples on ahead</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>and said,“Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat on. Untie it, and bring it along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say this: ‘The Lord needs it.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went off and found it as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>While they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>The disciples answered, “The Lord needs it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>Then they brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>As he was riding along, people kept spreading their coats on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>He was now approaching the descent from the Mount of Olives. The whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>They said,	“How blessed is the kingwho comes in the name of the Lord!	Peace in heaven,and glory in the highest heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He replied,“I tell you, if they were quiet, the stones would cry out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>When he came closer and saw the city, he began to cry over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying,“If you had only known today what could have brought you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For the days will comewhen your enemies will build walls around you, surround you, and close you in on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>They will level you to the ground—you and your children within you. They will not leave one stone on another within you, because you didn't recognize the time when God came to help you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Then Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>He said to them,“It is written, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer,’but you have turned it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>Then he began teaching in the temple every day. The high priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>but they couldn't find a way to do it, because all the people were eager to hear him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One day while he was teaching the people in the temple and telling them the good news, the high priests and the scribes came with the elders</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and asked him, “Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answered them,“I, too, will ask you a question.Tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Was John's authority to baptizefrom heaven or from humans?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>They discussed this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, ‘From humans,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they didn't know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Then Jesus told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he began to tell the people this parable:“A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went abroad for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>He sent another servant, and they beat him, too, treated him shamefully, and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>Then he sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I'll send my son whom I love. Maybe they'll respect him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the farmers saw him, they talked it over among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let's kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.” Those who heard him said, “That must never happen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But Jesus R	‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>When the scribes and the high priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay their hands on him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he detected their cunning and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>“Show me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?”They said, “Caesar's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>So they couldn't catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer, they became silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Now some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>and asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>Then the second</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third married her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Finally, the woman died, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jesus said to them,“Those who belong to this age marry and are married,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Nor can they die anymore, for they are like the angels and, since they share in the resurrection, are God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all people are alive to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes replied, “Teacher, you have given a fine answer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to ask him another question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>Then he said to them,“How can peoplesay that the Christis David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>For David himself in the book of Psalms says,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>So David calls him 'Lord.' Then how can he be his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>They devour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Now Jesus looked up and saw rich people dropping their gifts into the offering box.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>Then he saw a destitute widow drop in two small copper coins.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death, for they were afraid of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>But Satan went into Judas called Iscariot, who belonged to the circle of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>So he went off and discussed with the high priests and the temple police how he could betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>He accepted their offer and began to look for a good opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then the day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover meal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He said to them,“Just after you go into the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks you, “Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished. Get things ready for us there.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>Now when the hour came, he took his place at the table, along with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>He said to them,“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>For I tell you, I will never again eat one until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,“Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>For I tell you, from now on I will never drink the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>Then he took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it in pieces, and handed it to them, saying,“This is my body, which is given for you. Keep on doing this in memory of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>He did the same with the cup after supper, saying,“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been determined, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom he is betrayed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Then they began to discuss among themselves which one of them was going to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>Now an argument sprang up among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>But he said to them,“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But you are not to do so. On the contrary, the greatest among you should become like the youngest, and the one who leads should become like the one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? It is the one at the table, isn't it? But I am among you as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>“You are the ones who have always stood by me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit down on thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>“Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked permission to sift all of youlike wheat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail. When you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go even to prison and to death with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>But Jesus said,“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Then he said to them,“When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn't lack anything, did you?”They replied, “Nothing at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>Then he said to them,“But now the one who has a wallet must take it along, and his traveling bag, too. And the one who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I tell you, what has been written about me must be fulfilled: ‘He was counted among the criminals.’Indeed, what is written about me must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>So they said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords.”He answered them,“Enough of that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then he left and went to the Mount of Olives, as usual. The disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>When he came to the place, he said to them,“Keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like large drops of blood falling on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>When he got up from prayer, he went to the disciples and found them asleep from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>He said to them,“Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. The man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and he came close to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>But Jesus said to him,“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>When those who were around him saw what was about to take place, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>Then one of them struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But Jesus said,“No more of this!” So he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the high priests, the temple police, and the elders, who had come for him,“Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>While I was with you day after day in the temple, you didn't lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Then they arrested him, led him away, and brought him to the high priest's house. But Peter was following at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had taken their seats, Peter, too, sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, “This man was with him, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied it, saying, “I don't know him, woman!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>A little later a man looked at him and said, “You are one of them, too.”But Peter said, “Mister, I am not!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour later another man emphatically asserted, “This man was certainly with him, for he is a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, “Mister, I don't know what you're talking about!” Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord and how he had said to him,“Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went outside and cried bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they kept insulting him in many other ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”But he said to them,“If I tell you, you won't believe me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if I ask you a question, you won't answer me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Then they all asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?”He answered them,“You say that I am.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>They began to accuse him, “We found this man corrupting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he is the Christ, a king.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”He answered him,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Then Pilate said to the high priests and crowds, “I do not find anything blameworthy in this man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they kept insisting, “He is stirring up the people by teaching all over Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>When he learned with certainty that Jesus came from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now Herod was very glad to see Jesus, because he had been wanting to see him for a long time on account of what he had heard about him. He was also hoping to see some sign done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus gave him no answer at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood by and continued to accuse him vehemently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Even Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. Then he put a magnificent robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Then Pilate called the high priests, the other leaders, and the people together</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him “Not Guilty” of the charges you make against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>Nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>So I will punish him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all shouted out together, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(This was a man who had been put in prison for a revolt that had taken place in the city and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they continued to shout, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Then he spoke to them a third time: “What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder—the man they continued to demand—but he let them have their way with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept beating their breasts and wailing for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turned to them and said,“Womenof Jerusalem, stop crying for me, but cry for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For the days are surely coming when peoplewill say, ‘How blessed are the women who couldn't bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’, and to the hills, ‘Cover us up!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus kept saying,“Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing.” Then they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. Even the leaders were mocking him and saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, whom he has chosen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also made fun of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting him, saying, “You are the Christ, aren't you? Save yourself and us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>We have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he went on to say, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was already about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>because the sun had stopped shining. And the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said,“Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “This man certainly was righteous!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts and turned back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>he had not voted for their plan and action—from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>So the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first day of the week at early dawn they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>but when they went in, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were puzzling over this, two men in dazzling robes suddenly stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>Because the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men asked them, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here but has been raised. Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>‘the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and all the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But these words seemed nonsense to them, and they wouldn't believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw only the linen cloths. Then he went home wondering about what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>On the same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>He asked them,“What are you discussing with each other as you're walking along?” They stood still and looked gloomy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there these days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>He asked them,“What things?”They answered him, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in the things that he did and said before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Even some of our women have startled us! They were at the tomb early this morning</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had actually seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then Jesus said to them,“O how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe everything the prophets said!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>The Christhad to suffer these things and then enter his glory, didn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>As they came near the village where they were going, he acted as though he were going on farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day is almost gone.” So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>Then they said to each other, “Our hearts kept burning within us as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>That same hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their companions all together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>They kept saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>Then they themselves began to tell what had happened on the road and how he was recognized by them when he broke the bread in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>They were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>He said to them,“Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Look at my hands and my feet, for it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While they still could not believe it for joy and were full of amazement, he said to them,“Do you have anything here to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then he said to them,“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds so that they might come to understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>He said to them,“Thus it is written, that the Christwas to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>I am sending on you what my Father promised. But stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And they were continually in the temple blessing God.</verse>
