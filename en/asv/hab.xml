      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then shall he sweep by [as] a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, [even] he whose might is his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men`s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, [to thee] that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah`s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men`s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran.     Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were [as] of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a [sure] word.     Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>Thou didst march though the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.     Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his       warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds` [feet], And will make me to walk upon my high places.</verse>
