      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; [so do I now].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>I thank him that enabled me, [even] Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to [his] service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, [himself] man, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony [to be borne] in its own times;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one that ruleth well his own house, having [his] children in subjection with all gravity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Deacons in like manner [must be] grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Women in like manner [must be] grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the spirit, Seen of angels, Preached among the nations, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed [until now]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>but refuse profane and old wives` fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>These things also command, that they may be without reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, [having been] the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints` feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And withal they learn also [to be] idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I desire therefore that the younger [widows] marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>for already some are turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it mat relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his hire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at [the mouth of] two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge [thee] in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men`s sins: keep thyself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach`s sake and thine often infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men`s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honor and power eternal. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is [life] indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto [thee], turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.</verse>
