      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention [of you] in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and [in] much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation [is] not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye are witnesses, and God [also], how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>as ye know how we [dealt with] each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging [you], and testifying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, [even the word] of God, ye accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For ye are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and God`s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort [you] concerning your faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also [to see] you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also [do] toward you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk, --that ye abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work`s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>pray without ceasing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>despise not prophesyings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>prove all things; hold fast that which is good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
