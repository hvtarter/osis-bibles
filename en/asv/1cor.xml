      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>unto the church of God which is at Corinth, [even] them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their [Lord] and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye be] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them [that are of the household] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, [yea] and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh should glory before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And [which] entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But unto us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able [to bear it]: nay, not even now are ye able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God`s fellow-workers: ye are God`s husbandry, God`s building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each man`s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man`s work of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man`s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man`s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and ye are Christ`s; and Christ is God`s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man`s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ`s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you] hath his father`s wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, [even] Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say [this] to move you to shame. What, cannot there be [found] among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no [kind] is without signification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying [is for a sign], not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any man speaketh in a tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most three, and [that] in turn; and let one interpret:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And let the prophets speak [by] two or three, and let the others discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>for God is not [a God] of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ`s, at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then [cometh] the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.</verse>
