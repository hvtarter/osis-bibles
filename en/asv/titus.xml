      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God`s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For the bishop must be blameless, as God`s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre`s sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>[to be] sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine [showing] uncorruptness, gravity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>[Exhort] servants to be in subjection to their own masters, [and] to be well-pleasing [to them] in all things; not gainsaying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works [done] in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
