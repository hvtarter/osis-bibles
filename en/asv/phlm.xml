      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for love`s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he was therefore parted [from thee] for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth [thee] aught, put that to mine account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>[and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
