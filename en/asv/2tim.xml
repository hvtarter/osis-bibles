      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>That good thing which was committed unto [thee] guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I endure all things for the elect`s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master`s use, prepared unto every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And the Lord`s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>Every scripture inspired of God [is] also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge [thee] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</verse>
