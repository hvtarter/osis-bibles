        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth [them] out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius hath the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write [them] to thee with ink and pen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
