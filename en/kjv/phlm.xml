        <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <title>Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</title>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </verse>
