        <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</verse>
