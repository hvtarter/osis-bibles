Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name was Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous, and godly, abstaining from everything evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And he had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great <note>Lit. ministry</note> household, and he had a great husbandry on the earth; and that man was most noble of the men of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons visiting one another prepared a banquet every day, taking with them also their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And when the days of the banquet were completed, Job sent and purified them, having risen up in the morning, and offered sacrifices for them, according to their number, and one calf for <note>Gr. sin</note> a sin-offering for their souls: for Job said, Lest peradventure my sons have thought evil in their minds against God. Thus, then Job did continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>And it came to pass on a day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the Lord said to the devil, Whence art thou come? And the devil answered the Lord, and said, I am come from compassing the earth, and walking up and down in <note>Gr. the earth under heaven</note> the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the Lord said to him, Hast thou diligently considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from everything evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then the devil answered, and said before the Lord, Does Job worship the Lord for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his household, and all his possessions round about? and hast thou not blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle upon the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thine hand, and touch all that he has: verily he will bless thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>Then the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I give into thine hand all that he has, but touch not himself. So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it came to pass on a certain day, that Job’s sons and his daughters were drinking wine in the house of their elder brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and said to him, The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding near them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the spoilers came and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, Fire has fallen from heaven, and burnt up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds like wise; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he is yet speaking, another messenger comes, saying to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking with their elder brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>suddenly a great wind came on from the desert, and <note>Gr. touched</note> caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>So Job arose, and rent his garments, and shaved the hair of his head, and fell on the earth, and worshipped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and said, I myself came forth naked from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away: as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all these events that befell him Job sinned not at all before the Lord, and did not impute folly to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And it came to pass on a certain day, that the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came among them to stand before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the Lord, said to the devil, Whence comest thou? Then the devil said before the Lord, I am come from going through <note>Gr. the earth under heaven</note> the world, and walking about the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the Lord said to the devil, Hast thou then observed my servant Job, that there is none of men upon the earth like him, a harmless, true, blameless, godly man, abstaining from all evil? and he yet cleaves to innocence, whereas thou has told me to destroy his substance without cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And the devil answered and said to the Lord, Skin for skin, all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>Nay, but put forth thine hand, and touch his bones and his <note>Gr. plural</note> flesh: verily he will bless thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I deliver him up to thee; only save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So the devil went out from the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from his feet to his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge, and sat upon a dung-heap outside the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And when much time had passed, his wife said to him, How long wilt thou hold out, saying, <note>(2:9AA)</note> Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the hope of my deliverance? <note>(2:9BA)</note> for, behold, thy memorial is abolished from the earth, even thy sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows; <note>(2:9CA)</note> and thou thyself sittest down to spend the nights in the open air among the corruption of worms, <note>(2:9CA)</note> and I am a wanderer and a servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from my labours and my pangs which now beset me: <note>(2:9DA)</note> but say some word against the Lord, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he looked on her, and said to her, Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things? In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with his lips before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now his three friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him, came to him each from his own country: Eliphaz the king of the Thaemans, Baldad sovereign of the Saucheans, Sophar king of he Minaeans: and they came to him with one accord, to comfort and to visit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried with a loud voice, and wept, and rent every one his garment, and sprinkled dust upon their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>and they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born, and that night in which they said, Behold a man-child!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that <note>Heb. and Alex. day</note> night be darkness, and let not the Lord regard it from above, neither let light come upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>But let darkness and the shadow of death seize it; let blackness come upon it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>
          <note>Or, let that day be cursed; and as for the night, let darkness, etc.</note> let that day and night be cursed, let darkness carry <note>Gr. it</note> them away; let it not come into the days of the year, neither let it be numbered with the days of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>But let that night be pain, and let not mirth come upon it, nor joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>But let him that curses that day curse it, even he that is ready to attack the great <note>Or, monster; See Ge 1:21; Heb. Leviathan; Possibly the LXX refer to Isa 27:1</note> whale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of that night be darkened; let it remain dark, and not come into light; and let it not see the morning star arise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>because it shut not up the gates of my mother’s womb, for so it would have removed sorrow from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>For why died I not in the belly? and why did I not come forth from the womb and die immediately?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>and why did the knees support me? and why did I suck the breasts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>Now I should have lain down and been quiet, I should have slept and been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with kings and councillors of the earth, who gloried in their swords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with rulers, whose gold was abundant, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>or I should have been as an untimely birth proceeding from his mother’s womb, or as infants who never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the ungodly have burnt out the fury of rage; there the wearied in body rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>And the men of old time have together ceased to hear the exactor’s voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there, and the servant that feared his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>For why is light given to those who are in bitterness, and life to those souls which are in griefs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who desire death, and obtain it not, digging for it as for treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>and would be very joyful if they should gain it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Death is rest to such a man, for God has hedged him in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my groaning comes before my food, and I weep being beset with terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the terror of which I meditated has come upon me, and that which I had feared has befallen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not at peace, nor quiet, nor had I rest; yet wrath came upon me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>Hast thou been often spoken to in distress? but who shall endure the force of thy words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>For whereas thou hast instructed many, and hast strengthened the hands of the weak one,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not thy fear founded in folly, thy hope also, and the <note>One MS. gives akakia, «guilelessness’</note> mischief of thy way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember then who has perished, being pure? or when were the true-hearted utterly destroyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Accordingly as I have seen men ploughing barren places, and they that sow them will reap sorrows for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>They shall perish by the command of the Lord, and shall be utterly consumed by the breath of his wrath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>horror and trembling seized me, and caused all my bones greatly to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And a spirit came before my face; and my hair and flesh quivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>I arose and perceived it not: I looked, and there, was no form before my eyes: but I only heard a breath and a voice, saying,</verse>
