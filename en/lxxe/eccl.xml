Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I spoke in my heart, saying, Behold, I am increased, and have acquired wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem: also I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And my heart knew much—wisdom, and knowledge, parables and understanding: I perceived that this also is <note>Lit. deliberate choice</note> waywardness of spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, and behold thou good: and, behold, this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said to laughter, Madness: and to mirth, Why doest thou this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>And I examined whether my heart would excite my flesh as with wine, (though my heart guided me in wisdom,) and I desired to lay hold of mirth, until I should see of what kind is the good to the sons of men, which they should do under the sun all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I enlarged my work; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them every kind of fruit-tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made me <note>Lit. baths</note> pools of water, to water from them the timber-bearing wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I got servants and maidens, and servants were born to me in the house: also I had abundant possession of flocks and herds, beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>Moreover I collected for myself both silver and gold also, and the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces: I procured me singing men and singing women, and delights of the sons of men, a butler and female cupbearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I became great, and advanced beyond all that were before in Jerusalem: also my wisdom was established to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever mine eyes desired, I withheld not from them, I withheld not my heart from all my mirth: for my heart rejoiced in all my labour; and this was my portion of all my labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>And I looked on all my works which my hands had wrought, and on my labour which I laboured to perform: and behold, all was vanity and waywardness of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>Then I looked on to see wisdom, and madness, and folly: for who is the man who will follow after counsel, in all things where in he employs it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>And I saw that wisdom excels folly, as much as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I perceived, even I, that one event shall happen to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>And I said in my heart, As the event of the fool is, so shall it be to me, even to me: and to what purpose have I gained wisdom? I said moreover in my heart, This is also vanity, because the fool speaks of his abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no remembrance of the wise man with the fool for ever; forasmuch as now in the coming days all things are forgotten: and how shall the wise man die with the fool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>So I hated life; because the work that was wrought under the sun was evil <note>Gr. toward, or, upon me</note> before me: for all is vanity and waywardness of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>And I hated the whole of my labour which I took under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? and whether he will have power over all my labour in which I laboured, and wherein I grew wise under the sun? this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>so I went about to dismiss from my heart all my labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is such a man that his labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in fortitude; yet this man shall give his portion to one who has not laboured therein. This is also vanity and great <note>Gr. wickedness</note> evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For it happens to a man in all his labour, and in the purpose of his heart wherein he labours under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are days of sorrows, and <note>Or, distraction</note> vexation of spirit is his; in the night also his heart rests not. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>A man has nothing really good <note>Gr. which he shall eat and which, etc.</note> to eat, and to drink, and to shew his soul as good in his trouble. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who shall eat, or who shall drink, without <note>i. e. God</note> him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For God has given to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but he has given to the sinner trouble, to add and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God; for this is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>All the things which he has made are beautiful in his time: he has also set the whole <note>Or, age</note> world in their heart, that man might not find out the work which God has wrought from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is no good in them, except for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>Also in the case of every man who shall eat and drink, and see good in all his labour, this is a gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatsoever things God has done, they shall be for ever: it is impossible to add to it, and it is impossible to take away from it: and God has done it, that men may fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which has been is now; and whatever things are appointed to be have already been; and God will seek out that which is past.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who knows the wise? and who knows the interpretation of a saying? A man’s wisdom will lighten his countenance; but a man of shameless countenance will be hated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>Observe the commandment of the king, and that because of the word of the oath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Be not hasty; thou shalt go forth out of his presence: stand not in an evil matter; for he will do whatsoever he shall please,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>even as a king having power: and who will say to him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>He that keeps the commandment shall not know an evil thing: and the heart of the wise knows the time of judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>For to every thing there is time and judgement; for the knowledge of a man is great to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For there is no one that knows what is going to be: for who shall tell him how it shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; and there is no power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in the day of the battle; neither shall ungodliness save her votary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>So I saw all this, and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun; all the things wherein man has power over man to afflict him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>And then I saw the ungodly carried into the tombs, and that out of the holy place: and they departed, and were praised in the city, because they had done thus: this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because there is no contradiction made on the part of those who do evil quickly, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully determined in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>He that has sinned has done evil from that time, and long from beforehand: nevertheless I know, that it is well with them that fear God, that they may fear before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>but it shall not be well with the ungodly, and he shall not prolong his days, which are as a shadow; forasmuch as he fears not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are righteous persons to whom it happens according to the doing of the ungodly; and there are ungodly men, to whom it happens according to the doing of the just: I said, This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I praised mirth, because there is no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry: and this shall attend him in his labour all the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>Whereupon I set my heart to know wisdom, and to perceive the trouble that was wrought upon the earth: for there is that neither by day nor night sees sleep with his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>And I beheld all the works of God, that a man shall not be able to discover the work which is wrought under the sun; whatsoever things a man shall endeavour to seek, however a man may labour to seek it, yet he shall not find it; yea, how much soever a wise man may speak of knowing it, he shall not be able to find it: for I applied all this to my heart, and my heart has seen all this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>I saw that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: yea, there is no man that knows either love or hatred, though all are before their face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>Vanity is in all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, and to the bad; both to the pure, and to the impure; both to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifice not: as is the good, so is the sinner: as is the swearer, even so is he that fears an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>There is this evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yea, the heart of the sons of men is filled with evil, and madness is in their heart during their life, and after that they go to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>for who is he that has fellowship with all the living? there is hope of him: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; yea, there is no portion for them any more for ever in all that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go, eat thy bread with mirth, and drink thy wine with a joyful heart; for now God has favourably accepted thy works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let thy garments be always white; and let not oil be wanting on thine head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>And <note>So the Heb.</note> see life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which are given thee under the sun: for that is thy portion in thy life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatsoever thine hand shall find to do, do <note>Gr. as thy power is</note> with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Hades wither thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet wealth to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of knowledge; for time and chance will happen to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For surely man also knows not his time: as fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as birds that are caught in a snare; even thus the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>This I also saw to be wisdom under the sun, and it is great before me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>suppose there were a little city, and few men in it; and there should come against it a great king, and surround it, and build great mounds against it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>and should find in it a poor wise man, and he should save the city through his wisdom: yet no man would remember that poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>And I said Wisdom is better than power: yet the wisdom of the poor man is set at nought, and his words not listened to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise are heard in quiet more than the cry of them that rule in folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war: and one sinner will destroy much good.</verse>
