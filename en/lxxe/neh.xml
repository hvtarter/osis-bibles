Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>So I set men in the lowest part of the place behind the wall in the lurking-places, I even set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the captains, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember our great and terrible God, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was made known to us, and God had frustrated their counsel, that we all returned to the wall, every man to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that day that half of them that had been driven forth, wrought the work, and half of them <note>Or, resisted</note> kept guard; and there were spears, and shields, and bows, and breast-plates, and rulers behind the whole house of Juda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>even of them that were building the wall:—and those who carried the burdens were under arms: each with one hand wrought his work, and with the other held his dart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>And the builders wrought each man having his sword girt upon his loins, and so they built: and the trumpeter with his trumpet next to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and abundant, and we are dispersed upon the wall, each at a great distance from his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In whatsoever place ye shall hear the sound of the cornet, thither gather yourselves together to us; and our God shall fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we continued labouring at the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>And at that time I said to the people, Lodge ye every man with his servant in the midst of Jerusalem, and let the night be a watch-time to you, and the day a work-time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>And I was there, and the watchmen behind me, and there was not a man of us that put off his garments.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And the cry of the people and their wives was great against their brethren the Jews.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>And they said, We will restore, and we will not exact of them; we will do thus as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and bound them by oath to do according to this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>And I shook out my garment, and said, So may God shake out every man who shall not keep to this word, from his house, and from his <note>q. d. fruits of labour</note> labours, he shall be even thus shaken out, as an outcast and empty.

        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanaballat and Gesam sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they were plotting to do me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me again to this effect; and I sent them word <note>sc. as I have said</note> accordingly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And moreover thou has appointed prophets to thyself, that thou mightest dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Juda: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I came into the house of Semei the son of Dalaia the Son of Metabeel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, <note>Alex. +Who is the man such as I that will flee</note> Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable devised against me:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations round about us feared, and great alarm <note>Gr. fell upon their eyes</note> fell upon them, and they knew that it was of our God that this work should be finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>And in those days letters came to Tobias from many nobles of Juda, and those of Tobias came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For many in Juda were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Sechenias the son of Herae; and Jonan his son had taken the daughter of Mesulam the son of Barachia to wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.12.31'>And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great companies for thanksgiving, and they passed on the right hand on the wall of the dung-gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.32'>And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.33'>and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.34'>and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.35'>And some of the sons of the priest with trumpets, Zacharias son of Jonathan, son of Samaias, son of Matthania, son of Michaia, son of Zacchur, son of Asaph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.36'>and his brethren, <note>These terminations often vary</note> Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.37'>and Esdras the scribe was before them, at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.38'/>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.39'>of Ephraim, <note>The text (is) defective here</note> and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.12.41'/>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.42'>And the singers were heard, and were numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.43'>And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.44'>And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first-fruits, and the tithes, and for the chiefs of the cities who were assembled among them, <note>See Heb.</note> to furnish portions for the priests and Levites: for there was joy in Juda over the priests and over the Levites that waited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.45'>And they kept the <note>Gr. watches</note> charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and ordered the singers and the porters, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.46'>For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and they sang hymns and praise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.12.47'>And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.13'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.1'>In that day <note>Gr. it was read</note> they read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not enter into the congregation of God for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.2'>because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.3'>And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they were separated, even every <note>Gr. mixed one</note> alien in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.4'>And before this time Eliasib the priest dwelt in the treasury of the house of our God, connected with Tobias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.5'>and he made himself a great treasury, and there they were formerly in the habit of bestowing the offerings, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, the ordered portion of the Levites, and singers, and porters; and the first-fruits of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.6'>But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Arthasastha king of Babylon I came to the king, and after a certain time I made my request of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.7'>and I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the mischief which Eliasib had done in the case of Tobias, in making for him a treasury in the court of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>And it appeared very evil to me: so I cast forth all the furniture of the house of Tobias from the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>And I gave orders, and they purified the treasuries: and I restored thither the vessels of the house of God, and the offerings, and the frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.10'>And I understood that the portion of the Levites had not been given: and they had fled every one to his field, the Levites and the singers doing the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>And I strove with the commanders, and said, Wherefore has the house of God been abandoned? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>And all Juda brought a tithe of the wheat and the wine and the oil into the treasuries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>to the charge of Selemia the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaea of the Levites: and next to them was Anan the son of Zacchur, son of Matthanias; for they were accounted faithful: it was their office to distribute to their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O God, in this, and let not my kindness be <note>Gr. blotted out</note> forgotten which I have wrought in regard to the house of the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Juda men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and loading asses with both wine, and grapes, and figs, and every kind of burden, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>and I testified in the day of their sale. Also their dwelt in it men bringing fish, and selling every kind of merchandise to the children of Juda and in Jerusalem on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>And I strove with the free children of Juda, and said to them, What is this evil thing which ye do, and profane the sabbath-day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them and upon us and upon this city all these evils? and do ye bring additional wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burdens on the sabbath-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So all the merchants lodged, and carried on traffic without Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge in front of the wall? if ye do so again, I will stretch out my hand upon you. From that time they came not on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>and I told the Levites who were purifying themselves, and came and kept the gates, that they should sanctify the sabbath-day. Remember me, O God, for these things, and spare me according to the abundance of thy mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>And in those days I saw the Jews who had <note>Gr. settled, or, located</note> married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and did not know how to speak in the Jewish language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I strove with them and cursed them; and I smote some of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, and ye shall not take of their daughters to your sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin thus? though there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women turned him aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>So we will not hearken to you to do all this evil, to break covenant with our God, —to <note>Gr. settle</note> marry strange wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>and Elisub the high priest, one of the sons of Joada, being son-in-law of Sanaballat the Uranite, <note>Gr. and I chased him, etc.</note> I chased him away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O God, for their false connection with the priesthood, and the breaking the covenant of the priesthood, and for defiling the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>So I purged them from all foreign connection, and established courses for the priests and the Levites, every man according to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>And the offering of the wood-bearers was at certain set times, and in the times of the first-fruits. Remember me, O our God, for good.</verse>
