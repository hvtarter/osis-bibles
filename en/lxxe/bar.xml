Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Bar.2.17'>Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.18'>But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.19'>Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.20'>For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.2.24'>But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.25'>And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.2.26'>And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.2.28'>As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Bar.4.1'>This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.2'>Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.3'>Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.4'>O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.5'>Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.6'>Ye were sold to the nations, not for your destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.7'>For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.8'>Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.9'>For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.10'>For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.11'>With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.12'>Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.13'>They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.14'>Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.15'>For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.16'>These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.17'>But what can I help you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.18'>For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.19'>Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.20'>I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.21'>Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.22'>For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.23'>For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.24'>Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.25'>My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.26'>My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.27'>Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.28'>For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.29'>For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.30'>Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.31'>Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.32'>Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.33'>For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.34'>For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.35'>For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.36'>O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.4.37'>Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Bar.5'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.1'>Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the glory that cometh from God for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.2'>Cast about thee a double garment of the righteousness which cometh from God; and set a diadem on thine head of the glory of the Everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.3'>For God will shew thy brightness unto every country under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.4'>For thy name shall be called of God for ever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of God’s worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.5'>Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look about toward the east, and behold thy children gathered from the west unto the east by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.6'>For they departed from thee on foot, and were led away of their enemies: but God bringeth them unto thee exalted with glory, as children of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.7'>For God hath appointed that every high hill, and banks of long continuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.8'>Moreover even the woods and every sweetsmelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.5.9'>For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Bar.6'>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.1'>A copy of an epistle, which Jeremy sent unto them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.2'>Because of the sins which ye have committed before God, ye shall be led away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.3'>So when ye be come unto Babylon, ye shall remain there many years, and for a long season, namely, seven generations: and after that I will bring you away peaceably from thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.4'>Now shall ye see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause the nations to fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.5'>Beware therefore that ye in no wise be like to strangers, neither be ye and of them, when ye see the multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.6'>But say ye in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.7'>For mine angel is with you, and I myself caring for your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.8'>As for their tongue, it is polished by the workman, and they themselves are gilded and laid over with silver; yet are they but false, and cannot speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.9'>And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for the heads of their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.10'>Sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.11'>Yea, they will give thereof to the common harlots, and deck them as men with garments, being gods of silver, and gods of gold, and wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.12'>Yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth, though they be covered with purple raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.13'>They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, when there is much upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.14'>And he that cannot put to death one that offendeth him holdeth a sceptre, as though he were a judge of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.15'>He hath also in his right hand a dagger and an axe: but cannot deliver himself from war and thieves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.16'>Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.17'>For like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in the temple, their eyes be full of dust through the feet of them that come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.18'>And as the doors are made sure on every side upon him that offendeth the king, as being committed to suffer death: even so the priests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest their gods be spoiled with robbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.19'>They light them candles, yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.20'>They are as one of the beams of the temple, yet they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping out of the earth; and when they eat them and their clothes, they feel it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.21'>Their faces are blacked through the smoke that cometh out of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.22'>Upon their bodies and heads sit bats, swallows, and birds, and the cats also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.23'>By this ye may know that they are no gods: therefore fear them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.24'>Notwithstanding the gold that is about them to make them beautiful, except they wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten did they feel it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.25'>The things wherein there is no breath are bought for a most high price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.26'>They are borne upon shoulders, having no feet whereby they declare unto men that they be nothing worth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.27'>They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they cannot rise up again of themselves: neither, if one set them upright, can they move of themselves: neither, if they be bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but they set gifts before them as unto dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.28'>As for the things that are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse; in like manner their wives lay up part thereof in salt; but unto the poor and impotent they give nothing of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.29'>Menstruous women and women in childbed eat their sacrifices: by these things ye may know that they are no gods: fear them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.30'>For how can they be called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.31'>And the priests sit in their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.32'>They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.33'>The priests also take off their garments, and clothe their wives and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.34'>Whether it be evil that one doeth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor put him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.35'>In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow unto them, and keep it not, they will not require it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.36'>They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.37'>They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor help any man in his distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.38'>They can shew no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.39'>Their gods of wood, and which are overlaid with gold and silver, are like the stones that be hewn out of the mountain: they that worship them shall be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.40'>How should a man then think and say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.41'>Who if they shall see one dumb that cannot speak, they bring him, and intreat Bel that he may speak, as though he were able to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.42'>Yet they cannot understand this themselves, and leave them: for they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.43'>The women also with cords about them, sitting in the ways, burn bran for perfume: but if any of them, drawn by some that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.44'>Whatsoever is done among them is false: how may it then be thought or said that they are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.45'>They are made of carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will have them to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.46'>And they themselves that made them can never continue long; how should then the things that are made of them be gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.47'>For they left lies and reproaches to them that come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.48'>For when there cometh any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.49'>How then cannot men perceive that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war, nor from plague?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.50'>For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with silver and gold, it shall be known hereafter that they are false:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.51'>And it shall manifestly appear to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.52'>Who then may not know that they are no gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.53'>For neither can they set up a king in the land, nor give rain unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.54'>Neither can they judge their own cause, nor redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows between heaven and earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.55'>Whereupon when fire falleth upon the house of gods of wood, or laid over with gold or silver, their priests will flee away, and escape; but they themselves shall be burned asunder like beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.56'>Moreover they cannot withstand any king or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that they be gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.57'>Neither are those gods of wood, and laid over with silver or gold, able to escape either from thieves or robbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.58'>Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong take, and go away withal: neither are they able to help themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.59'>Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power, or else a profitable vessel in an house, which the owner shall have use of, than such false gods; or to be a door in an house, to keep such things therein, than such false gods. or a pillar of wood in a palace, than such false gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.60'>For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.61'>In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to be seen; and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.62'>And when God commandeth the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are bidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.63'>And the fire sent from above to consume hills and woods doeth as it is commanded: but these are like unto them neither in shew nor power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.64'>Wherefore it is neither to be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do good unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.65'>Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.66'>For they can neither curse nor bless kings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.67'>Neither can they shew signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.68'>The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.69'>It is then by no means manifest unto us that they are gods: therefore fear them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.70'>For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing: so are their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.71'>And likewise their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold, are like to a white thorn in an orchard, that every bird sitteth upon; as also to a dead body, that is east into the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.72'>And ye shall know them to be no gods by the bright purple that rotteth upon them: and they themselves afterward shall be eaten, and shall be a reproach in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Bar.6.73'>Better therefore is the just man that hath none idols: for he shall be far from reproach.</verse>
