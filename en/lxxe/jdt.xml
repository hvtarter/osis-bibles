Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.1'>In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, which reigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.2'>And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.3'>And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundred cubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.4'>And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in array of his footmen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.5'>Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.6'>And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hill country, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, and the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations of the sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.7'>Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all that dwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those that dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all that dwelt upon the sea coast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.8'>And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, and Galaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.9'>And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, and the river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.10'>Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.11'>But all the inhabitants of the land made light of the commandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went they with him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he was before them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from them without effect, and with disgrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.12'>Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all this country, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, and that he would slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till ye come to the borders of the two seas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.13'>Then he marched in battle array with his power against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: for he overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his chariots,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.14'>And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.15'>He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smote him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.1.16'>So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all his company of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, an hundred and twenty days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jdt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.1'>And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.2'>So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.3'>Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey the commandment of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.4'>And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which was next unto him, and said unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.5'>Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth, Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with thee men that trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twenty thousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.6'>And thou shalt go against all the west country, because they disobeyed my commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.7'>And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earth and water: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of mine army, and I will give them for a spoil unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.8'>So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks and the river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.9'>And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.10'>Thou therefore shalt go forth. and take beforehand for me all their coasts: and if they will yield themselves unto thee, thou shalt reserve them for me till the day of their punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.11'>But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them; but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.12'>For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever I have spoken, that will I do by mine hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.13'>And take thou heed that thou transgress none of the commandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I have commanded thee, and defer not to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.14'>Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors and captains, and the officers of the army of Assur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.15'>And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lord had commanded him, unto an hundred and twenty thousand, and twelve thousand archers on horseback;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.16'>And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.17'>And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a very great number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.18'>And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and very much gold and silver out of the king’s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.19'>Then he went forth and all his power to go before king Nabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.20'>A great number also sundry countries came with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.21'>And they went forth of Nineve three days’ journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.22'>Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen and chariots, and went from thence into the hill country;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.23'>And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness at the south of the land of the Chellians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.24'>Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, till ye come to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.25'>And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, over against Arabia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.26'>He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned up their tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.27'>Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time of wheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed their flocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wasted their countries, and smote all their young men with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.2.28'>Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all the inhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan; and they that dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jdt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.1'>So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.2'>Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king lie before thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.3'>Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields of wheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tents lie before thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.4'>Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are thy servants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.5'>So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto him after this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.6'>Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen men for aid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.7'>So they and all the country round about received them with garlands, with dances, and with timbrels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.8'>Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down their groves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, that all nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all tongues and tribes should call upon him as god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.9'>Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto Judea, over against the great strait of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.3.10'>And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there he tarried a whole month, that he might gather together all the carriages of his army.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jdt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.1'>Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiled all their temples, and brought them to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.2'>Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and were troubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.3'>For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.4'>Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.5'>And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.6'>Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days in Jerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, which is over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.7'>Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the most.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.8'>And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest had commanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.9'>Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, and with great vehemency did they humble their souls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.10'>Both they, and their wives and their children, and their cattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought with money, put sackcloth upon their loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.11'>Thus every man and women, and the little children, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.12'>And cried to the God of Israel all with one consent earnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and their wives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations to rejoice at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.13'>So God heard their prayers, and looked upon their afflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.14'>And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had their loins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free gifts of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.4.15'>And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel graciously.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jdt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.1'>Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war, and had shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all the tops of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaign countries:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.2'>Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes of Moab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.3'>And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, who this people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are the cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, and wherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, or captain of their army;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.4'>And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.5'>Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.6'>This people are descended of the Chaldeans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.7'>And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.8'>For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.5.9'>Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jdt.10.19'>And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.10.20'>And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.10.21'>Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.9'>Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.10'>The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.11'>Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but they were overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.12'>The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives’ children: they perished by the battle of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.13'>I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art great and glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.14'>Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and they were made, thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, and there is none that can resist thy voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.15'>For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yet thou art merciful to them that fear thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.16'>For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but he that feareth the Lord is great at all times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.17'>Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgement, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.18'>Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.19'>Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.20'>So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.21'>After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was in her time honourable in all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.22'>And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.23'>But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband’s house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.24'>And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jdt.16.25'>And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.</verse>
