Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>The Lord lives, with truth, in judgement and righteousness, then shall nations <note>Gr. in him</note> bless by him, and by him they shall praise God in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Break up fresh ground for yourselves, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise your hardness of heart, ye men of Juda, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my wrath go forth as fire, and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare ye in Juda, and let it be heard in Jerusalem: say ye, Sound the trumpet in the land; cry ye aloud: say ye, Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Gather up your wares and flee to Sion: hasten, stay not: for I will bring evils from the north, an great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion is gone up from his lair, he has roused himself to the destruction of the nations, and has gone forth out of his place, to make the land desolate; and the cities shall be destroyed, so as to be without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For these things gird yourselves with sackclothes, and lament, and howl: for the anger of the Lord is not turned away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be amazed, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>And I said, O sovereign Lord, verily thou hast deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, There shall be peace; whereas behold, the sword has reached even to their soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time they shall say to this people and to Jerusalem, There is a spirit of error in the wilderness: the way of the daughter of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>But a spirit of <note>Gr. accomplishment</note> full vengeance shall come upon me; and now I declare my judgements against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are in misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Cleanse thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: how long will thy grievous thoughts be within thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice of one publishing from Dan shall come, and trouble out of mount Ephraim shall be heard of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Remind ye the nations; behold, they are come: proclaim it in Jerusalem, that bands are approaching from a land afar off, and have uttered their voice against the cities of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field, they have surrounded her; because thou, saith the Lord, has neglected me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, for it is bitter, for it has reached to thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>I am pained in my bowels, my bowels, and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>for all the land is distressed: suddenly my tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been rent asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see fugitives, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For the princes of my people have not known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but how to do good they have not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was not; and to the sky, an there was no light in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld the mountains, and they trembled, and I saw all the hills in commotion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky were scared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I saw, and, behold, Carmel was desert, and all the cities were burnt with fire at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his fierce anger they were utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>Thus saith the Lord, The whole land shall be desolate; but I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have <note>Lit. rushed forward</note> purposed, and I will not turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>The whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, and adorn thyself with golden ornaments; though thou adorn thine eyes with stibium, thy <note>Lit. beautifying</note> beauty will be in vain: thy lovers have rejected thee, they seek thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard thy groaning as the voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose the strength of her hands, saying, Woe is me! for my soul faints because of the slain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run ye about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye can find one, if there is any one that does judgement, and seeks faithfulness; and I will pardon them, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>The Lord lives, they say; do they not therefore swear falsely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Lord, thine eyes are upon faithfulness: thou hast scourged them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them; but they would not receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; and they would not return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Then I said, It may be they are poor; for they are weak, for they know not the way of the Lord, or the judgement of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go to the rich men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgement of God: but, behold, with one consent they have broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore has a lion out of the forest smitten them, and a wolf has destroyed them <note>See Heb.</note> even to their houses, and a leopard has watched against their cities: all that go forth from them shall be hunted: for they have multiplied their ungodliness, they have strengthened themselves in their revoltings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>In what way shall I forgive thee for these things? Thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and lodged in harlots’ houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.8'>They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after his neighbour’s wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.9'>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.10'>Go up upon her battlements, and break them down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses: for they are the Lord’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.11'>For the house of Israel have indeed dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord: the house of Juda also</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.12'>have lied to their Lord, and they have said, These things are not so; no evils shall come upon us; and we shall not see sword or famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.13'>Our prophets became wind, and the word of the Lord was not in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.14'>Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I have made my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.15'>Behold, I will bring upon you a nation from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; a nation the sound of whose language one shall not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.16'>They are all mighty men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.17'>and they shall devour you harvest, and your bread; and shall devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig-plantations, and your olive yards: and they shall <note>Gr. thresh as corn</note> utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein ye trusted, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.18'>And it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I will not utterly destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.19'>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that thou shalt say to them, Because ye served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.20'>Proclaim these things to the house of Jacob, and let them be heard in the house of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.21'>Hear ye now these things, O foolish and senseless people; who have eyes, and see not; and have ears, and hear not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.22'>will ye not be afraid of me? saith the Lord; and will ye not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea, as a perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yea, it shall <note>Gr. be troubled</note> rage, but not prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.23'>But this people has a disobedient and rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.5.25'>Your transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good things from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.26'>For among my people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have caught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.27'>As a snare which has been set is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great, and become rich:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.28'>and they have transgressed the rule of judgement; they have not judged the cause of the orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.29'>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.30'>Shocking and horrible deeds have been done on the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.31'>the prophets utter unrighteous prophecies, and the priests have clapped their hands: and my people has loved to have it thus: and what will ye do for the future.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.6'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.1'>Strengthen yourselves, ye children of Benjamin, to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and sound an alarm with the trumpet in Thecue, and set up a signal over Baethacharma: for evil threatens from the north, and a great destruction is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.2'>And thy pride, O daughter of Sion, shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.3'>The shepherds and their flocks shall come to her; and they shall pitch their tents against her round about, and shall feed their flocks each with his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.4'>Prepare yourselves for war against her; rise up, and let us go up against her at noon. Woe to us! for the day has gone down, for the shadows of the day fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.5'>Rise, and let us go up against her by night, and destroy her foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.6'>For thus saith the Lord, Hew down her trees, <note>Gr. pour out a force</note> array a numerous force against Jerusalem. O false city; there is all oppression in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.7'>As a cistern cools water, so her wickedness cools her, ungodliness and misery shall be heard in her, as continually before her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.8'>Thou shalt be chastened, O Jerusalem, with pain and the scourge, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee a desert land, which shall not be inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.9'>For thus saith the Lord, Glean, glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back your hands as a grape-gatherer to his basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.10'>To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may hearken? behold, thine ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.11'>And I <note>Gr. filled my wrath</note> allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept it in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.12'>And their houses shall be turned to others, with their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.13'>For from the least of them even to the greatest they have all committed iniquity; from the priest even to the false prophet they have all wrought falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.14'>And they healed the breach of my people imperfectly, making light of it, and saying, Peace, peace, and where is peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.15'>They were ashamed because they failed; yet they were not ashamed as those who are truly ashamed, and they knew not their own disgrace: therefore shall they utterly fall when they do fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.16'>Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.17'>I have set watchmen over you, saying, Hear ye the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.18'>Therefore have the nations heard, and they that feed their flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.19'>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evils upon this people, even the fruit of their rebellions; for they have not heeded my words, and they have rejected my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.20'>Wherefore do ye bring me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a land afar off? your whole-burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices have not been pleasant to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.21'>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring weakness upon this people, and the fathers and sons shall be weak together; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.22'>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people comes from the north, and <note>Heb. and Alex. «a great nation’</note> nations shall be stirred up from the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.23'>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; the people is fierce, and will have no mercy; their voice is as the roaring sea; they shall array themselves for war against thee as fire on horses and chariots, O daughter of Sion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.24'>We have heard the report of them: our hands are weakened: anguish has seized us, the pangs as of a woman in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.25'>Go not forth into the field, and walk not in the ways; for the sword of the enemy lingers round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.26'>O daughter of my people, gird thyself with sackcloth: sprinkle thyself with ashes; make for thyself pitiable lamentation, as the mourning for a beloved son: for misery will come suddenly upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.27'>I have caused thee to be tried among tried nations, and thou shalt know me when I have tried their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.28'>They are all disobedient, walking perversely: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.6.29'>The bellows have failed from the fire, the lead has failed: the silversmith works at his trade in vain; their wickedness <note>Gr. has not been melted away</note> is not consumed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.20.2'>And he smote him, and cast him into the <note>Or, possibly stocks</note> dungeon which was by the gate of the upper house that was set apart, which was by the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.3'>And Paschor brought Jeremias out of the dungeon: and Jeremias said to him, The Lord has not called thy name Paschor, but Exile.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.20.7'>Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I have been deceived: thou hast been strong, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock, I am continually mocked every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.8'>For I will laugh with my bitter speech, I will call upon rebellion and misery: for the word of the Lord is become a reproach to me and a mockery all my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.9'>Then I said, I will by no means name the name of the Lord, and I will no more at all speak in his name. But it was a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am utterly weakened on all sides, and cannot bear up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.10'>For I have heard the reproach of many gathering round, saying, Conspire ye, and let us <note>Compare 2 Co 11:28</note> conspire together against him, even all his friends: watch his intentions, if perhaps he shall be deceived, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall be avenged on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.11'>But the Lord was with me as a mighty man of war: therefore they persecuted me, but could not perceive anything against me; they were greatly confounded, for they perceived not their disgrace, which shall never be forgotten.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.20.17'>because he slew me not in the womb, and my mother became not my tomb, and her womb <note>Gr. of everlasting conception</note> always great with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.18'>Why is it that I came forth of the womb to see troubles and distresses, and my days are spent in shame?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.6'>So mine anger and my wrath dropped upon them, and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and <note>Lit. inaccessible</note> a waste, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.7'>And now thus has the Lord Almighty said, Wherefore do ye commit these great evils against your souls? to cut off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end that not one of you should be left;</verse>
