Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>then Zorobabel, and Jesus and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel said to them, It is not for us and you to build a house to our God, for we ourselves will build together to the Lord our God, as Cyrus the king of the Persians commanded us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Now then be it known to the king, that if that city be built up, and its walls completed, thou shalt have no tribute, neither will they pay anything, and this injures kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>And it is not lawful for us to see the dishonour of the king: therefore have we sent and made known the matter to the king;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We therefore declare to the king, that, if that city be built, and its walls be set up, <note>Lit. there is no peace to thee</note> thou shalt not have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then the king sent to Reum the chancellor, and Sampsa the scribe, and the rest of their fellow-servants who dwelt in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, saying, Peace; and he says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The tribute-gatherer whom ye sent to us, has been called before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And a decree has been made by me, and we have examined, and found that city of old time exalts itself against kings, and that rebellions and desertions take place within it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.35'>At that time the children of the banishment that came from the captivity offered whole-burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve goats for a sin-offering; all whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.36'>And they gave the king’s mandate to the king’s lieutenants, and the governors beyond the river: and they honoured the people and the house of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>And when these things were finished, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands in their abominations, even the Chananite, the Ethite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, and the Moserite and the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and their sons; and the holy seed has passed among the nations of the lands, and the hand of the rulers has been first in this transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>And when I heard this thing, I rent my garments, and trembled, and plucked some of the hairs of my head and of my beard, and sat down mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Then there assembled to me all that followed the word of the God of Israel, on account of the transgression of the captivity; and I remained mourning until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.5'>And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my humiliation; and when I had rent my garments, <note>Or, and</note> then I trembled, and I bow myself on my knees, and spread out my hands to the Lord God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.6'>and I said, O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded, O my God, to lift up my face to thee: for our transgressions have abounded over our head, and our trespasses have increased even to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>From the days of our fathers we have been in a great trespass until this day: and <note>Gr. in</note> because of our iniquities we, and our kings, and our children, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the Gentiles by the sword, and by captivity, and by spoil, and with shame of our face, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And now our God has dealt mercifully with us, so as to leave us to escape, and to give us an establishment in the place of his sanctuary, to enlighten our eyes, and to give a little quickening in our servitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we are slaves, yet in our servitude the Lord our God has not deserted us; and he has extended favour to us in the sight of the kings of the Persians, to give us a quickening, that they should raise up the house of our God, and restore the desolate places of it, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>What shall we say, our God, after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>which thou hast given us by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, into which ye go to inherit it, is a land subject to disturbance by the removal of the people of the nations for their abominations, wherewith they have filled it <note>Gr. from mouth to mouth, Hebraism</note> from one end to the other by their uncleanness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>And now give not your daughters to their sons, and take not of their daughters for your sons, neither shall ye seek their peace or their good for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and transmit it as an inheritance to your children for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after all that is <note>Gr. coming</note> come upon us because of our evil deeds, and our great trespass, it is clear that there is none such as our God, for thou has lightly visited our iniquities, and given us deliverance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>whereas we have repeatedly broken thy commandments, and intermarried with the people of the lands: be not very angry with us to our utter destruction, so that there should be no remnant or escaping one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we remain yet escaped, as at this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee on this account.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.1'>So when Esdras had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and praying before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel came together to him, men and women and youths; for the people wept, and wept aloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And Sechenias the son of Jeel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Esdras, We have broken covenant with our God, and have <note>Gr. settled, or, caused to dwell</note> taken strange wives of the nations of the land: yet now there is patience of hope to Israel concerning this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Now then let us make a covenant with our God, to put away all the wives, and their offspring, as thou shalt advise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.4'>arise, and alarm them with the commands of our God; and let it be done <note>Gr. as the law is</note> according to the law. Rise up, for the matter is upon thee; and we are with thee: be strong and do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.5'>Then Esdras arose, and caused the rulers, the priests, and Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word: and they swore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.6'>And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the treasury of Joanan the son of Elisub; he even went thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water; for he mourned over the <note>Gr. covenant-breaking</note> unfaithfulness of them of the captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And they made proclamation throughout Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.8'>Every one who shall not arrive within three days, as is the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his substance shall be <note>Gr. accursed</note> forfeited, and he shall be separated from the congregation of the captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.9'>So all the men of Juda and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. This was the ninth month: on the twentieth day of the month all the people sat down in the street of the house of the Lord, because of their alarm concerning the word, and because of the storm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.10'>And Esdras the priest arose, and said to them, Ye have broken covenant, and have <note>Gr. settled</note> taken strange wives, to add to the trespass of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.11'>Now therefore give praise to the Lord God of our fathers, and do that which is pleasing in his sight: and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the strange wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.12'>Then all the congregation answered and said, This thy word is powerful upon us to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.13'>But the people is numerous, and the season is stormy, and there is no power to stand without, and the work is more than enough for one day or for two; for we have greatly sinned in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.14'>Let now our rulers stand, and for all those in our cities who have taken strange wives, let them come at appointed times, and with them elders from every several city, and judges, to turn away the fierce wrath of our God from us concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.15'>Only Jonathan the son of Asael, and Jazias the son of Thecoe were with me concerning this; and Mesollam, and Sabbathai the Levite helped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.16'>And the children of the captivity did thus: and Esdras the priest, and heads of families according to their house were separated, and all by their names, for they returned in the first day of the tenth month to search out the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.17'>And they made an end with all the men who had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.18'>And there were found some of the sons of the priests who had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gadalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.19'>And they <note>Gr. gave their hand</note> pledged themselves to <note>Gr. bring forth</note> put away their wives, and offered a ram of the <note>Gr. sheep</note> flock for a trespass-offering because of their trespass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.20'>And of the sons of Emmer; Anani, and Zabdia.</verse>
