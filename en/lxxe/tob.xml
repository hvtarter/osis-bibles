Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

      <chapter osisID='Tob.1'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.1'>The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.2'>Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.3'>I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.4'>And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.5'>Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.6'>But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.7'>The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.8'>And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father’s mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.9'>Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.10'>And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.11'>But I kept myself from eating;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.12'>Because I remembered God with all my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.13'>And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.14'>And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.15'>Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go into Media.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.16'>And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.17'>And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.18'>And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.19'>And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.20'>Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.21'>And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father’s accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.22'>And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him: and he was my brother’s son.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.2'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.1'>Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restored unto me, with my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, in the which I sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.2'>And when I saw abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go and bring what poor man soever thou shalt find out of our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord; and, lo, I tarry for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.3'>But he came again, and said, Father, one of our nation is strangled, and is cast out in the marketplace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.4'>Then before I had tasted of any meat, I started up, and took him up into a room until the going down of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.5'>Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat in heaviness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.6'>Remembering that prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.7'>Therefore I wept: and after the going down of the sun I went and made a grave, and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.8'>But my neighbours mocked me, and said, This man is not yet afraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; and yet, lo, he burieth the dead again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.9'>The same night also I returned from the burial, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted and my face was uncovered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.10'>And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went into Elymais.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.11'>And my wife Anna did take women’s works to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.12'>And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.13'>And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said unto her, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.14'>But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more than the wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render it to the owners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied upon me, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, thou and all thy works are known.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.3'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.1'>Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.2'>O Lord, thou art just, and all thy works and all thy ways are mercy and truth, and thou judgest truly and justly for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.3'>Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins and ignorances, and the sins of my fathers, who have sinned before thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.4'>For they obeyed not thy commandments: wherefore thou hast delivered us for a spoil, and unto captivity, and unto death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.5'>And now thy judgements are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers’: because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.6'>Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.7'>It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father’s maids;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.8'>Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.9'>Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.10'>When she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.11'>Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.12'>And now, O Lord, I set I mine eyes and my face toward thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.13'>And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.14'>Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.15'>And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.16'>So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.17'>And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.4'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.1'>In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.2'>And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.3'>And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.4'>Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.5'>My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.6'>For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.7'>Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.8'>If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.9'>For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.10'>Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.11'>For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.12'>Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father’s tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.13'>Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.14'>Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.15'>Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.16'>Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.17'>Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.18'>Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.19'>Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.20'>And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.21'>And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.5'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.1'>Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.2'>But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.3'>Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.4'>Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.5'>But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.6'>To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.7'>Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.8'>Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.9'>So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.10'>Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.11'>To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.12'>Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.13'>Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.14'>But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.15'>Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.16'>So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man’s dog with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.17'>But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.18'>Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.19'>For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.20'>Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.21'>For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.22'>Then she made an end of weeping.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.6'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.1'>And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.2'>And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.3'>Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.4'>To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.5'>So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.6'>Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.7'>And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.8'>As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.9'>And when they were come near to Rages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.10'>The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.11'>For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.12'>And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than to any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.13'>Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.14'>And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.15'>Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.16'>And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.6.17'>And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.7'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.1'>And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.2'>Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.3'>And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.4'>Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.5'>And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.6'>Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.7'>And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.8'>And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.9'>So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.10'>For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.11'>I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.12'>Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to the manner, for thou art her cousin, and she is thine, and the merciful God give you good success in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.13'>Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thy father. And he blessed them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.14'>And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.15'>Then they began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.16'>After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.17'>Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought her thither: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said unto her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.7.18'>Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.8'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.1'>And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.2'>And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.3'>The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.4'>And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.5'>Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.6'>Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.7'>And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lush but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.8'>And she said with him, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.9'>So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.10'>Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.11'>But when Raguel was come into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.12'>He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.13'>So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.14'>And came forth, and told them that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.15'>Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect praise thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.16'>Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.17'>Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.18'>Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.19'>And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.20'>For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.8.21'>And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife be dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.9'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.1'>Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.2'>Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.3'>For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.4'>But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.5'>So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.9.6'>And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.10'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.1'>Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.2'>Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.3'>Therefore he was very sorry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.4'>Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.5'>Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.6'>To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.7'>But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.8'>Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.9'>But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.10'>But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.11'>Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.12'>And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.10.13'>And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust; where are do not entreat her evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.11'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.1'>After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.2'>Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.3'>Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.4'>And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.5'>Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.6'>And when she espied him coming, she said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.7'>Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.8'>Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall away, and he shall see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.9'>Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.10'>Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.11'>And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall on his fathers’ eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.12'>And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.13'>And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.14'>And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.15'>For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.16'>Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.17'>But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which were at Nineve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.18'>And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.11.19'>And Tobias’ wedding was kept seven days with great joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.12'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.1'>Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thou must give him more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.2'>And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.3'>For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.4'>Then the old man said, It is due unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.5'>So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.6'>Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.7'>It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.8'>Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.9'>For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.10'>But they that sin are enemies to their own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.11'>Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.12'>Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.13'>And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.14'>And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.15'>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.16'>Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.17'>But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.18'>For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.19'>All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.20'>Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.21'>And when they arose, they saw him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.12.22'>Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.13'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.1'>Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.2'>For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.3'>Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.4'>There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.5'>And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath scattered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.6'>If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.7'>I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.8'>Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.13.9'>O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children’s works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Tob.14'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.1'>So Tobit made an end of praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.2'>And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.3'>And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.4'>Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.5'>And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.6'>And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.7'>So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.8'>And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.9'>But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.10'>And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.11'>Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.12'>And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.13'>Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.14'>And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.14.15'>But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.</verse>
