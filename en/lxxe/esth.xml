Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

          <note>LXX text not in Heb. has been left out.</note>
          <note>Note. —In the Heb. and some copies of the LXX, Esther begins here;</note> And it came to pass after these <note>Gr. words</note> things in the days of Artaxerxes, —(this Artaxerxes ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>in those days, when king Artaxerxes was on the throne in the city of Susa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to his friends, and the other nations, and to the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and the chief of the satraps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>And after this, after he had shewn to them the wealth of his kingdom, and the abundant glory of his wealth during a hundred and eighty days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>when, I say, the days of the marriage feast were completed, the king made a banquet to the nations who were present in the city six days, in the court of the king’s house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>which was adorned with hangings of fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs, on pillars of Parian marble and stone: there were golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of pearl, and of Parian stone, and <note>Lit. transparent</note> open-worked coverings variously flowered, having roses worked round about;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out of the value of thirty thousand talents, abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And this banquet was not according to the appointed law; but so the king would have it: and he charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Astin the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where king Artaxerxes dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>Now on the seventh day the king, being merry, told Aman, and Bazan, and Tharrha, and Barazi, and Zatholtha, and Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of king Artaxerxes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring in the queen to him, to <note>Gr. to make her queen</note> enthrone her, and crown her with the diadem, and to shew her to the princes, and her beauty to the nations: for she was beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But queen Astin hearkened not to him to come with the chamberlains: so the king was grieved and angered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>And he said to his friends, Thus hast Astin spoken: pronounce therefore upon this case law and judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>So Arkesaeus, and Sarsathaeus, and Malisear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief in rank by the king, drew near to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>and reported to him according to the laws how it was proper to do to queen Astin, because she had not done the things commanded of the king by the chamberlains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Muchaeus said to the king and to the princes, Queen Astin has not wronged the king only, but also all the king’s rulers and princes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she <note>Gr. contradicted</note> disobeyed the king. As then, said he, she refused to obey king Artaxerxes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>so this day shall the other ladies of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, dare in the same way to dishonour their husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If then it seem good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter it: and let not the queen come in to him any more; and let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And let the law of the king which he shall have made, be widely proclaimed, in his kingdom: and so shall all the women give honour to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Muchaeus had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language, <note>Gr. that there might be fear to them, etc.</note> in order that men might be feared in their own houses.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>And after this the king’s anger was pacified, and he no more mentioned Astin, bearing in mind what she had said, and how he had condemned her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then the servants of the king said, Let there be sought for the king chaste and beautiful young virgins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint local governors in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select fair and chaste young damsels and bring them to the city Susa, into the women’s apartment, and let them be consigned to the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women; and let things for purification and other attendance be given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And let the woman who shall please the king be queen instead of Astin. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>Now there was a Jew in the city Susa, and his name was Mardochaeus, the son of Jairus, the son of Semeias, the son of Cisaeus, of the tribe of Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been brought a prisoner from Jerusalem, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he had a foster child, daughter of Aminadab his father’s brother, and her name was Esther; and when her parents were dead, he brought her up for a wife for himself: and the damsel was beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>And because the king’s ordinance was published, many damsels were gathered to the city Susa under the hand of Gai; and Esther was brought to Gai the keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the damsel pleased him, and she found favour in his sight; and he hasted to give her the things for purification, and her portion, and the seven maidens appointed her out of the palace: and he treated her and her maidens well in the women’s apartment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>But Esther discovered not her family nor her kindred: for Mardochaeus had charged her not to tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>But Mardochaeus used to walk every day by the women’s court, to see what would become of Esther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now this was the time for a virgin to go into the king, when she should have fulfilled twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women’s purifications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>And then the damsel goes in to the king; and the officer to whomsoever he shall give the command, will bring her to come in with him from the women’s apartment to the king’s chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>She enters in the evening, and in the morning she departs to the second women’s apartment, where Gai the king’s chamberlain is keeper of the women: and she goes not in to the king again, unless she should be called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>And when the time. was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mardochaeus’ father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women’s keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all that looked upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther went in to king Artaxerxes in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther, and she found favour beyond all the other virgins: and he put on her the queen’s crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>And the king made a banquet for all his friends and great men for seven days, and he highly celebrated the marriage of Esther; and he made a release to those who were under his dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>But Mardochaeus served in the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Now Esther had not discovered her <note>Gr. country</note> kindred; for so Mardochaeus commanded her, to fear God, and perform his commandments, as when she was with him: and Esther changed not her manner of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>And two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mardochaeus was promoted; and they sought to kill king Artaxerxes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the matter was discovered to Mardochaeus, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And the king examined the two chamberlains, and hanged them: and the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal <note>Gr. library</note> records of the good offices of Mardochaeus, as a commendation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>And after this king Artaxerxes highly honoured Aman son of Amadathes, the Bugaean, and exalted him, and set his seat above all his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all in the palace did him obeisance, for so the king had given orders to do: but Mardochaeus did not do him obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>And they in the king’s palace said to Mardochaeus, Mardochaeus, why dost thou transgress the commands of the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Thus they spoke daily to him, but he hearkened not unto them; so they represented to Aman that Mardochaeus resisted the commands of the king: and Mardochaeus had shewn to them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Aman understood that Mardochaeus did not obeisance to him, he was greatly enraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>and took counsel to destroy utterly all the Jews who were under the rule of Artaxerxes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>And he made a <note>Gr. vote by ballot</note> decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, and cast lots daily and monthly, to slay in one day the race of Mardochaeus: and the lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month which is Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations in all thy kingdom, and their laws differ from those of all the other nations; and they disobey the laws of the king; and it is not expedient for the king to let them alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them: and I will remit into the king’s treasury ten thousand talents of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Aman, to seal the decrees against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said to Aman, Keep the silver, and treat the nation as thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>So the king’s recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day, and they wrote as Aman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to a hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their several languages, in the name of king Artaxerxes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And the message was sent by posts throughout the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy utterly the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods. <note>LXX text not in Heb. has been left out.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>And the copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>And the business was hastened, and that at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>But Mardochaeus having perceived what was done, rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself; and having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And he came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace, wearing sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying and lamentation and great mourning on the part of the Jews: they spread for themselves sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>And the queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her: and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed; and she sent to clothe Mardochaeus, and take away his sackcloth; but he consented not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>So Esther called for her chamberlain Achrathaeus, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mardochaeus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'/>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mardochaeus shewed him what was done, and the promise which Aman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>And he gave him the copy of the writing that was published in Susa concerning their destruction, to shew to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and intreat the king, and to beg him for the people, remembering, said he, the days of thy low estate, how thou wert nursed by my hand: because Aman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>So Achrathaeus went in and told her all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>And Esther said to Achrathaeus, Go to Mardochaeus, and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the nations of the empire know, that whoever, man or woman, shall go in to the king into the inner court uncalled, that person cannot live: only to whomsoever the king shall stretch out his golden sceptre, he shall live: and I have not been called to go into the king, for these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And Achrathaeus reported to Mardochaeus all the words of Esther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mardochaeus said to Achrathaeus, Go, and say to her, Esther, say not to thyself that thou alone wilt escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if thou shalt refuse to hearken on this occasion, help and protection will be to the Jews from another quarter; but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knows, if thou hast been made queen for this very occasion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>And Esther sent the man that came to her to Mardochaeus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and fast ye for me, and eat not and drink not for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidens will fast; and then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mardochaeus went and did all that Esther commanded him. <note>LXX text not in Heb. has been left out.</note></verse>

          <note>From the first verse to the third, the Gr. widely differs from the Heb.</note> And it came to pass on the third day, when she had ceased praying, that she put off her mean dress, and put on her glorious apparel. <note>(5:1AA)</note> And being splendidly arrayed, and having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train. <note>(5:1BA)</note> And she was blooming in the perfection of her beauty; and her face was cheerful, and it were benevolent, but her heart was straitened for fear. <note>(5:1CA)</note> And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king: and he was sitting upon his royal throne, and he had put on all his glorious apparel, covered all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrible. <note>(5:1DA)</note> And having raised his face resplendent with glory, he looked with intense anger: and the queen fell, and changed her colour as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before her. <note>(5:1EA)</note> But God changed the spirit of the king gentleness, and in intense feeling he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered: and he comforted her with peaceable words, and said to her, <note>(5:1FA)</note> What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die, for our command is openly declared to thee, Draw nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And having raised the golden sceptre he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her, and said, Speak to me. <note>(5:2AA)</note> And she said to him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy glory; for thou, my lord, art to be wondered at, and thy face is full of grace. (5 :2B) And while she was speaking, she fainted and fell. Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>And the king said, What wilt thou, Esther? and what is thy request? ask even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>And the king said, Hasten Aman hither, that we may perform the word of Esther. So they both come to the feast of which Esther had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is thy request, queen Esther? speak, and thou shalt have all that thou requirest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>And she said, My request and my petition are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>if I have found favour in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>So Aman went out from the king very glad and merry: but when Aman saw Mardochaeus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And he shewed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to-morrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>But these things please me not, while I see Mardochaeus the Jew in the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>And Zosara his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a <note>Gr. a tree cut</note> gallows made for thee of fifty cubits, and in the morning do thou speak to the king, and let Mardochaeus be hanged on the gallows: but do thou go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night: and he told his servant to bring in the <note>Gr. letters</note> books, the registers of daily events, to read to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And he found the <note>Gr. letters</note> records written concerning Mardochaeus, how he had told the king concerning the two chamberlains of the king, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, What honour or favour have we done to Mardochaeus? And the king’s servants said, Thou hast not done anything to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mardochaeus, behold, Aman was in the court. And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Aman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mardochaeus on the gallows, which he had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>And the king’s servants said, Behold, Aman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>And the king said to Aman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honour? And Aman said within himself, Whom would the king honour but myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let the king’s servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>and let him give it to one of the king’s noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the <note>Or, wide space</note> street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be done to every man whom the king honours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then the king said to Aman, Thou hast well said: so do to Mardochaeus the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what thou hast spoken be neglected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mardochaeus, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>And Mardochaeus returned to the palace: but Aman went home mourning, and having his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Aman related the events that had befallen him to Zosara his wife, and to his friends: and his friends and his wife said to him, <note>Or, if it be M. etc., before whom</note> If Mardochaeus be of the race of the Jews, and thou hast begun to be humbled before him, thou wilt assuredly fall, and thou wilt not be able to withstand him, for the living God is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Aman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Aman went in to drink with the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what is thy request, and what is thy petition? and it shall be done for thee, to the half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>And she answered and said, If I have found favour in the sight of the king, let my life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery; both we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the <note>See. Heb.</note> slanderer is not worthy of the king’s palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>And the king said, Who is this that has dared to do this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said, the <note>Gr. hostile man</note> adversary is Aman, this wicked man. Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to intreat the queen; for he saw that he was in <note>Gr. evils</note> an evil case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force my wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochaeus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be <note>Or, impaled</note> hanged thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochaeus: and then the king’s wrath was appeased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochaeus was called by the king; for Esther had shewn that he was related to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took the ring which he had taken away from Aman, and gave it to Mardochaeus: and Esther appointed Mardochaeus over all that had been Aman’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and besought him to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>Then the king stretched out to Esther the golden sceptre: and Esther arose to stand near the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>And Esther said, If it seem good to thee, and I have found favour in thy sight, let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my <note>Gr. country</note> kindred?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>And the king said to Esther, If I have given and freely granted thee all that was Aman’s, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what dost thou yet further seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>Write ye also in my name, as it seems good to you, and seal it with my ring: for whatever orders are written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, it is not <note>Or, possible</note> lawful to gainsay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>So the scribes were called in the first-month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same year; and orders were written to the Jews, whatever the king had commanded to the <note>Gr. stewards</note> local governors and chiefs of the satraps, from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, according to the several provinces, according to their dialects.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>And they were written by order of the king, and sealed with his ring, and they sent the letters by the posts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>wherein he charged them to use their own laws in every city, and to help each other, and to treat their adversaries, and those who attacked them, as they pleased,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>on one day in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>
          <note>LXX text not in Heb. has been left out.</note> And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king’s commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And Mardochaeus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw it and rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>And the Jews had light and gladness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>In that day the adversaries of the Jews perished: for no one resisted, through fear of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>For the chiefs of the satraps, and the princes and the royal scribes, honoured the Jews; for the fear of Mardochaeus lay upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'/>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>And in the city Susa the Jews slew five hundred men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>both Pharsannes, and Delphon and Phasga,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>and Pharadatha, and Barea, and Sarbaca,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>and Marmasima, and Ruphaeus, and Arsaeus, and Zabuthaeus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>the ten sons of Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugaean, the enemy of the Jews, and they plundered their property on the same day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>and the number of them that perished in Susa was rendered to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And the king said to Esther, The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa; and how, thinkest thou, have they used them in the rest of the country? What then dost thou yet ask, that it may be done for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>And Esther said to the king, let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them tomorrow as to hang the ten sons of Aman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Aman to hang.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth day of Adar, and slew three hundred men, but plundered no property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth day of Adar, but took no spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>On this account then it is that the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar as a <note>Gr. good day</note> holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mardochaeus wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>to establish these as joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies; and as to the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it in good days of <note>Gr. weddings</note> feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews consented to this accordingly as Mardochaeus wrote to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>shewing how Aman the son of Amadathes the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast <note>Gr. lot</note> lots to destroy them utterly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>also how he went in to the king, telling him to hang Mardochaeus: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>Therefore these days were called Phrurae, because of the lots; (for in their language they are called Phrurae;) because of the words of this letter, and because of all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>And Mardochaeus established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them to observe it, neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days were to be a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>And these days of the Phrurae, said they, shall be kept for ever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>And queen Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, and Mardochaeus the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Phrurae.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'/>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>And Mardochaeus and Esther the queen appointed a fast for themselves privately, even at that time also having formed their plan against their own health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And Esther established it by a command for ever, and it was written for a memorial.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And the king levied a tax upon his kingdom both by land and sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And as for his strength and valour, and the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the Persians and Medes, for a memorial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>And Mardochaeus <note>Gr. succeeded to, or, came into the place of</note> was viceroy to king Artaxerxes, and was a great man in the kingdom, and honoured by the Jews, and passed his life beloved of all his nation. <note>LXX text not in Heb. has been left out.</note></verse>
