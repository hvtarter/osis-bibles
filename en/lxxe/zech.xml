Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.
