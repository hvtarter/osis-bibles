Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>And we turned and went by the way leading to Basan; and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the Lord said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>And the Lord our God delivered him into our hands, even Og the king of Basan, and all his people; and we smote him until we left none of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we mastered all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country round about Argob, belonging to king Og in Basan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars; besides the very many cities of the Pherezites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>We utterly destroyed them as we dealt with Seon the king of Esebon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the women and the children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>and all the cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, extending from the brook of Arnon even unto Aermon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>The Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior, but the Amorite has called it Sanir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan as far as Elcha and Edraim, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og the king of Basan was left of the Raphain: behold, his bed was a bed of iron; behold, it is in the <note>Or, acropolis, citadel: or extremity of the land of the Ammonites</note> chief city of the children of Ammon; the length of it is nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And we inherited that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Galaad; and I gave his cities to Ruben and to Gad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasse, and all the country round about Argob, all that Basan; it shall be accounted the land of Raphain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>And Jair the son of Manasse took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Gargasi and Machathi: he called them by his name Basan Thavoth Jair until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And to Machir I gave Galaad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And to Ruben and to Gad I gave the land under Galaad as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook and as far as Jaboc; the brook is the border to the children Amman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>And Araba and Jordan are the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea under Asedoth Phasga eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I charged you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm yourselves, every one that is powerful, and go before your brethren the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>Only your wives and your children and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), let them dwell in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until the Lord your God give your brethren rest, as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then ye shall return, each one to his inheritance which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which thou crossest over thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Ye shall not be afraid of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>Lord God, thou hast begun to shew to thy servant thy strength, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as thou hast done, and according to thy might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I will therefore go over and see this good land that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilibanus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>And the Lord because of you did not regard me, and hearkened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice thee, speak not of this matter to me any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of the <note>i. e. Pisgah</note> quarried rock, and look with thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>And charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go before the face of this people, and he shall give them the inheritance of all the land which thou hast seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>And we abode in the valley near the house of Phogor.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>And now, Israel, hear the ordinances and judgements, all that I teach you this day to do: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, and ye shall not take from it: keep the commandments of the Lord our God, all that I command you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God did in the case of Beel-phegor; for every man that went after Beel-phegor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But ye that kept close to the Lord your God are all alive to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>Behold, I have shewn you ordinances and judgements as the Lord commanded me, that ye should do so in the land into which ye go to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>And ye shall keep and do them: for this is your wisdom and understanding before all nations, as many as shall hear all these ordinances; and they shall say, Behold, this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.7'>For what manner of nation is so great, which has God so near to them as the Lord our God is in all things in whatsoever we may call upon him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.8'>And what manner of nation is so great, which has righteous ordinances and judgements according to all this law, which I set before you this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.9'>Take heed to thyself, and keep thy <note>Gr. soul</note> heart diligently: forget not any of the things, which thine eyes have seen, and let them not depart from thine heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt teach thy sons and thy sons’ sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.10'>even the things that happened in the day in which ye stood before the Lord our God in Choreb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.11'>And ye drew nigh and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven: there was darkness, blackness, and tempest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.12'>And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire a voice of words, which ye heard: and ye saw no likeness, only ye heard a voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.13'>And he announced to you his covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten <note>Gr. words or sayings</note> commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.14'>And the Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you ordinances and judgements, that ye should do them on the land, into which ye go to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.15'>And take good heed to your hearts, for ye saw no similitude in the day in which the Lord spoke to you in Choreb in the mountain out of the midst of the fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.16'>lest ye transgress, and make to yourselves a carved image, any kind of figure, the likeness of male or female,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.17'>the likeness of any beast of those that are on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird which flies under heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.18'>the likeness of any reptile which creeps on the earth, the likeness of any fish of those which are in the waters under the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.19'>and lest having looked up to the sky, and having seen the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the <note>Gr. order of heaven</note> heavenly bodies, thou shouldest go astray and worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God has distributed to all the nations under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.20'>But God took you, and led you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.21'>And the Lord God was angry with me for the things said by you, and sware that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I should not enter into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.22'>For <note>Gr. I die</note> I am to die in this land, and shall not pass over this Jordan; but ye are to pass over, and shall inherit this good land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.23'>Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made with you, and ye transgress, and make to yourselves a graven image of any of the things concerning which the Lord thy God commanded thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.24'>For <note>Heb 12:29</note> the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.25'>And when thou shalt have begotten sons, and shalt have sons’ sons, and ye shall have dwelt a long time on the land, and shall have transgressed, and made a graven image of any thing, and shall have done wickedly before the Lord your God to provoke him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.26'>I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you, that ye shall surely perish from off the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it there; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.27'>And the Lord shall scatter you among all nations, and ye shall be left few in number among all the nations, among which the Lord shall bring you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.28'>And ye shall there serve other gods, the works of the hands of men, wood and stones, which <note>Gr. shall not see, etc.</note> cannot see, nor can they hear, nor eat, nor smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.29'>And there ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye shall find him whenever ye shall seek him with all <note>Gr. thy</note> your heart, and with all <note>your affliction</note> your soul in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.30'>And <note>Gr. all these words shall find thee; Hebraism</note> all these things shall come upon thee in the last days, and thou shalt turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.31'>Because the Lord thy God is a God of pity: he will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which the Lord sware to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.32'>Ask of the former days which were before thee, from the day when God created man upon the earth, and beginning at the one end of heaven to the other end of heaven, if there has happened any thing like to this great event, if such a thing has been heard:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.33'>if a nation have heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and hast lived;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.34'>if God has assayed to go and take to himself a nation out of the midst of another nation with trial, and with signs, and with wonders, and with war, and with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights, according to all the things which the Lord our God did in Egypt <note>Gr. before thee seeing</note> in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.35'>So that thou shouldest know that the Lord thy God he is God, and there is none beside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.36'>His voice was made audible from heaven to instruct thee, and he shewed thee upon the earth his great fire, and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.37'>Because he loved thy fathers, he also chose you their seed after them, and he brought thee himself with his great strength out of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.38'>to destroy nations <note>Or, greater</note> great and stronger than thou before thy face, to bring thee in, to give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.39'>And thou shalt know this day, and shalt consider in thine heart, that the Lord thy God he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath, and there is none else but he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.40'>And keep ye his commandments, and his ordinances, all that I command you this day; that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, that ye may be long-lived upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.41'>Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan on the east,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.42'>that the slayer might flee thither, who should have slain his neighbour unintentionally, and should not have hated him <note>Gr. before yesterday and the third day; Hebraism</note> in times past, and he shall flee to one of these cities and live:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.4.47'>And they inherited his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.48'>From Aroer, which is on the border of the brook Arnon, even to the mount of Seon, which is Aermon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.5.1'>And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the ordinances and judgements, all that I speak in your ears this day, and ye shall learn them, and observe to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.2'>The Lord your God made a covenant with you in Choreb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.3'>The Lord did not make this covenant with your fathers, but with you: ye are all here alive this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.4'>The Lord spoke to you face to face in the mountain out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.5.5'>And I stood between the Lord and you at that time to report to you the words of the Lord, (because ye were afraid before the fire, and ye went not up to the mountain,) saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.5.9'>Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor shalt thou serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,</verse>
