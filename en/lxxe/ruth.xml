Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And the man’s name was Elimelech, and his wife’s name Noemin, and the <note>Gr. Name</note> names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and <note>Gr. were</note> remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And Elimelech the husband of Noemin died; and she was left, and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>And they took to themselves wives, women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpha, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited his people to give them bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>The Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons;</verse>

          <note>Gr. will</note> would ye wait for them till they should be grown? or would ye refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for <note>Gr. it is made bitter to me</note> I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And Noemin said to Ruth, Behold, thy <note>i. e. wife of a husband’s brother: no English word exactly answers to this</note> sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now thou also after thy sister-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee; for whithersoever thou goest, I will go, and wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And Noemin seeing that she <note>Gr. is</note> was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me «Bitter,’ for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call ye me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, <note>Gr. returned, returning from</note> returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>And Noemin had a friend an acquaintance of her husband, and the man was a mighty man of the kindred of Elimelech, and his name was Booz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Noemin, Let me go now to the field, and I will glean among the ears behind the man <note>Gr. in whosesoever eyes I shall find favour</note> with whomsoever I shall find favour: and she said to her, Go, daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>And she went; and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers; and she happened by chance to come on a portion of the land of Booz, of the kindred of Elimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And, behold, Booz came from Bethleem, and said to the reapers, The Lord be with you: and they said to him, The Lord bless thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>And Booz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose is this damsel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And his servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel who returned with Noemin out of the land of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the <note>Gr. handfuls</note> sheaves after the reapers: and she came and stood from morning till evening, and rested not even a little in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>And Booz said to Ruth, Hast thou not heard, my daughter? go not to glean in another field; and depart not thou hence, join thyself here with my damsels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>Let thine eyes be on the field where my men shall reap, and thou shalt go after them: behold, I have charged the young men not to touch thee: and when you shalt thirst, then thou shalt go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men shall have drawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>And she fell upon her face, and did reverence to the ground, and said to him, How is it that I have found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take notice of me, whereas I am a stranger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>And Booz answered and said to her, It has fully been told me how thou hast dealt with thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband; and how thou didst leave thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and camest to a people whom thou knewest not <note>Gr. yesterday and the third day</note> before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>The Lord recompense thy work; may a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to trust under his wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>And she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, because thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken <note>Gr. to the heart of; Hebraism</note> kindly to thy handmaid, and behold, I shall be as one of thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And Booz said to her, Now it is time to eat; come hither, and thou shalt eat of the bread, and thou shalt dip thy morsel in the vinegar: and Ruth sat by the side of the reapers: and Booz <note>Lit. heaped</note> handed her meal, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>And she rose up to glean; and Booz charged his young men, saying, Let her even glean among the sheaves, and <note>Gr. shame her not</note> reproach her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>And do ye by all means carry it for her, and ye shall surely let fall for her some of that which is heaped up; and let her eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field till evening, and beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned, and Ruth brought forth and gave to her the food which she had left from what she had been satisfied with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that took notice of thee. And Ruth told her mother-in-law where she had wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought to-day is Booz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he has not failed in his mercy with the living and with the dead: and Noemin said to her, The man is near akin to us, he is one of our relations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>And Ruth said to her mother-in-law, Yea, he said also to me, Keep close to my damsels, until the men shall have finished all my reaping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And Noemin said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is well, daughter, that thou wentest out with his damsels; thus they shall not meet thee in another field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>And Ruth joined herself to the damsels of Booz to glean until they had finished the barley-harvest and the wheat-harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>And she lodged with her mother-in-law: and Noemin her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>And now is not Booz our kinsman, with whose damsels thou wast? behold, <note>Or, he winnows the barley-floor</note> he winnows barley this night in the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>But do thou wash, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go up to the threshing-floor: do not discover thyself to the man until he has done eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>And it shall come to pass when he lies down, that thou shalt mark the place where he lies down, and shalt come and lift up the covering of his feet, and shalt lie down; and he shall tell thee what thou shalt do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>And Ruth said to her, All that thou shalt say, I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law enjoined her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And Booz ate and drank, and his heart was glad, and he came to lie down by the side of the heap of corn; and she came secretly, and lifted up the covering of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And it came to pass at midnight that the man was amazed, and troubled, and behold, a woman lay at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And he said, Who art thou? and she said, I am thine handmaid Ruth; spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid, for thou art a near relation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And Booz said, Blessed be thou of the Lord God, my daughter, for thou hast made thy latter kindness greater than the former, in that thou followest not after young men, whether any be poor or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>And now fear not, my daughter, whatever thou shalt say I will do to thee; for all the tribe of my people knows that thou art <note>Lit. a woman of strength or power</note> a virtuous woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>And now I am truly akin to thee; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Lodge here for the night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will do the part of a kinsman to thee, well—let him do it: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, I will do the kinsman’s part to thee, as the Lord lives; lie down till the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before a man could know his neighbour; and Booz said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And he said to her, Bring the apron that is upon thee: and she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and put them upon her, and she went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And Ruth went in to her mother-in-law, and she said to her, My daughter! and Ruth told her all that the man had done to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And she said to her, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>And she said, Sit still, my daughter, until thou shalt know how the matter will fall out; for the man will not rest until the matter be accomplished this day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>And Booz went up to the gate, and sat there; and behold, the relative passed by, of whom Booz spoke: and Booz said to him, Turn aside, sit down here, <note>Lit. secret one</note> such a one: and he turned aside and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And Booz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye here; and they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>And Booz said to the relative, The matter regards the portion of the field which <note>Gr. is</note> was our brother Elimelech’s which was given to Noemin, now returning out of the land of Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>and I said, I will <note>Gr. open or uncover thine ear</note> inform thee, saying, Buy it before those that sit, and before the elders of my people: if thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, tell me, and I shall know; for there is no one beside thee to do the office of a kinsman, and I am after thee: and he said, I am here, I will redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>And Booz said, In the day of thy buying the field of the hand of Noemin and of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased, thou must also buy her, so as to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>And the kinsman said, I shall not be able to redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance; do thou redeem my right for thyself, for I shall not be able to redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>And this was in former time the ordinance in Israel for redemption, and for a bargain, to confirm every word: A man loosed his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour that redeemed his right; and this was a testimony in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>And the kinsman said to Booz, Buy my right for thyself: and he took off his shoe and gave it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>And Booz said to the elders and to all the people, Ye are this day witnesses, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that <note>Gr. belong</note> belonged to Chelaion and Maalon, of the hand of Noemin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Moreover I have bought for myself for a wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Maalon, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; so the name of the dead shall not be destroyed from among his brethren, and from the tribe of his people: ye are this day witnesses.</verse>
