Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

      <chapter osisID='Sus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.1'>There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.2'>And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.3'>Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.4'>Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.5'>The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.6'>These kept much at Joacim’s house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.7'>Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.8'>And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.9'>And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgements.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.10'>And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.11'>For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.12'>Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.13'>And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.14'>So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.15'>And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.16'>And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.17'>Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.18'>And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.19'>Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.20'>Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.21'>If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.22'>Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.23'>It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.24'>With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.25'>Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.26'>So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.27'>But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.28'>And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.29'>And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, Joacim’s wife. And so they sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.30'>So she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.31'>Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.32'>And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.33'>Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.34'>Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.35'>And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.36'>And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.37'>Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.38'>Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness, ran unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.39'>And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.40'>But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.41'>Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders and judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.42'>Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.43'>Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.44'>And the Lord heard her voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.45'>Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.46'>Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.47'>Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.48'>So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools, ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.49'>Return again to the place of judgement: for they have borne false witness against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.50'>Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.51'>Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.52'>So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.53'>For thou hast pronounced false judgement and hast condemned the innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.54'>Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what tree sawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.55'>And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine own head; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.56'>So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.57'>Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.58'>Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them companying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.59'>Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in two, that he may destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.60'>With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them that trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.61'>And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.62'>And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in such sort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and they put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.63'>Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Sus.1.64'>From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight of the people.</verse>
