Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>There was a man of Armathaim Sipha, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Helkana, a son of Jeremeel the son of Elias the son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Anna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, but Anna had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And the man went up <note>Gr. from days to days</note> from year to year from his city, from Armathaim, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Selom: and there were Heli and his two sons Ophni and Phinees, the priests of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And the day came, and Helkana sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Phennana and her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>And to Anna he gave <note>Gr. one portion</note> a prime portion, because she had no child, only Helkana loved Anna more than the other; but the Lord had closed her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Helkana her husband said to her, Anna: and she said to him, Here am I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails thee that thou weepest? and why dost thou not eat? and why does thy heart smite thee? am I not better to thee than ten children?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>And Anna rose up after they had eaten in Selom, and stood before the Lord: and Heli the priest was on a seat by the <note>Gr. lintels</note> threshold of the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was very much grieved in spirit, and prayed to the Lord, and wept abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, O Lord God of Sabaoth, if thou welt indeed look upon the humiliation of thine handmaid, and remember me, and give to thine handmaid a <note>Gr. seed of men</note> man-child, then will I indeed dedicate him <note>Gr. before</note> to thee till the day of his death; and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and no <note>Gr. iron</note> razor shall come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, while she was long praying before the Lord, that Heli the priest marked her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>And she was speaking in her heart, and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: and Heli accounted her a drunken woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And the servant of Heli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? take away thy wine from thee, and go out from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Anna answered and said, Nay, my lord, I live <note>Compare en sklhra huera</note> in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>
          <note>Gr. give not</note> Count not thy handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued my prayer until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>And Heli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give thee all thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Thine handmaid has found favour in thine eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rise early in the morning, and worship the Lord, and they go their way: and Helkana went into his house at Armathaim, and knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass <note>Gr. in the season of days</note> when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Helkana and all his house went up to offer in Selom the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Anna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Helkana her husband said to her, Do that which is good in thine eyes, abide still until thou shalt have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of thy mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And she went up with him to Selom with a calf <note>Or, in its third year</note> of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Selom, and the child with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they brought him before the Lord; and his father slew his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and slew the calf; and Anna the mother of the child brought him to Heli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, I pray thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, I am the woman that stood in thy presence with thee while praying to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>My heart is established in the Lord, my horn is exalted in my God; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, I have rejoiced in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>For there is none holy as the Lord, and there is none righteous as our God; there is none holy besides thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Boast not, and utter not high things; let not high-sounding words come out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and God prepares his own designs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow of the mighty has waxed feeble, and the weak have girded themselves with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full of bread are brought low; and the hungry have forsaken the land; for the barren has born seven, and she that abounded in children has waxed feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The Lord kills and makes alive; he brings down to the grave, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The Lord makes poor, and makes rich; he brings low, and lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises the needy from the dunghill; to seat him with the princes of the people, and causing them to inherit the throne of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>granting his petition to him that prays; and he blesses the years of the righteous, for by strength cannot man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The Lord will weaken his adversary; the Lord is holy. Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, to understand and know the Lord, <note>Perhaps «and that the Lord executes,’ etc.; Compare Jer 9 :24</note> and to execute judgement and justice in the midst of the earth. The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered: he will judge the extremities of the earth, and he gives strength to our kings, and will exalt the horn of his Christ. And she left him there before the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>and departed to Armathaim: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Heli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>And the sons of Heli the priest were evil sons, not knowing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priest’s claim from every one of the people that sacrificed was this: the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a flesh-hook of three teeth was in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the flesh-hook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Selom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>And before the fat was burnt for a sweet savour, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of thee sodden flesh out of the caldron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for thyself of all things which thy soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for thou shalt give it me now; and if not I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nought the offering of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girt with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from <note>Lit. days to days</note> year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Heli blessed Helcana and his wife, saying The Lord recompense to thee seed of this woman, in return for the loan which thou hast lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the Lord visited Anna, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>And Heli was very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do ye according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Nay my sons, for the report which I hear is not good; do not so, for the <note>Or, the reports which I hear of the people not serving, etc.; Compare 1 Ch 13:4</note> reports which I hear are not good, so that the people do not serve God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel advanced, and <note>Gr. was good</note> was in favour with God and with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And a man of God came to Heli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of thy father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharao.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose the house of thy father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest’s office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>And wherefore hast thou looked upon my incense-offering and my meat-offering with a shameless eye, and hast honoured thy sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the first-fruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Thy house and the house of thy father shall pass before me for ever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honour them that honour me, and he that sets me at nought shall be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come when I will destroy thy seed and the seed of thy father’s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt not have an old man in my house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And if I do not destroy a man of thine from my altar, it shall be that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and every one that remains in thy house shall fall by the sword of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this which shall come upon thy two sons Ophni and Phinees shall be a sign to thee; in one day they shall both die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up to myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass that he that survives in thy house, shall come to do obeisance before him for a little piece of silver, <note>Alex. +’and for a piece of bread’</note> saying, <note>Gr. cast</note> Put me into one of thy priest’s offices to eat bread.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli the priest: and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no <note>Lit. distinguishing</note> distinct vision.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.1'>And Samuel died, and all Israel <note>Gr. assemble and bewail</note> assembled, and bewailed him, and they bury him in his house in <note>Heb. Ramah; Alex. Rama</note> Armathaim: and David arose, and went down to the wilderness of <note>Alex. Paran</note> Maon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and he was a very great man; and he had <note>Lit. 3000 flocks; as we say in English, 3,000 troops, meaning men formed into troops</note> three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>And the man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigaia: and his wife was of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man was harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man was churlish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name <note>Gr. concerning peace</note> how he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>And thus shall ye say, May thou and thy house seasonably prosper, and all thine be <note>Gr. in health</note> in prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>And now, behold, I have heard that thy shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing <note>Gr. for thee</note> thy sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Let then thy servants find grace in thine eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray thee, whatsoever thy hand may find, to thy son David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.10'>And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my <note>Gr. slaying</note> beasts that I have slain for <note>Gr. them that shear my sheep</note> my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So the servants of David <note>Gr. to their way</note> turned back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword. <note>Alex. and Heb. +’and they girded on every man his sword, and David also girded on his sword’</note> And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.16'>And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>And now do thou consider, and see what thou wilt do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he is a vile character, and one cannot speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.22'>So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.23'>And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him, bowing to the ground</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>
          <note>Heb. and Alex. +’and she fell’</note> even to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray thee, thy servant speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this pestilent man, <note>Heb. and Alex. +’even Nabal’</note> for according to his name, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom thou didst send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>And now, my lord, as the Lord lives, and thy soul lives, as the Lord has kept thee from coming against innocent blood, and <note>Gr. saving thy hand for thyself</note> from executing vengeance for thyself, now therefore let thine enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now accept this <note>Gr. blessing</note> token of goodwill, which thy servant has brought to my lord, and thou shalt give it to the servants that wait on my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>Remove, I pray thee, the trespass of thy servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>And if a man shall rise up persecuting thee and seeking thy life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and thou shalt whirl the life of thine enemies as in the midst of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee to be ruler over Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>then this shall not be an abomination and offence to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and thou shalt remember thine handmaid to do her good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Abigaia, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this very day to meet me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>and blessed be thy conduct, and blessed be thou, who hast hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing thee harm, if thou hadst not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall surely not be left to Nabal till the morning one male.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accepted thy <note>Gr. face</note> petition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal was merry <note>Gr. upon him</note> within him, and he was very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>And <note>Gr. there were about ten days, etc.</note> it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord smote Nabal, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>And David heard <note>Heb. and Alex. insert «that Nabal was dead’</note> it and said, Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant <note>Or, from the hand of wicked men</note> from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy servant is for an handmaid to wash the feet of thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.44'>And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of <note>Heb. and Alex. Laish and Lais</note> Amis who was of <note>Heb. and Alex. Gallim and Galli</note> Romma.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.26'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Echela, opposite Jessemon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him went three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul encamped in the hill of Echela in front of Jessemon, by the way, and David dwelt in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul <note>Gr. comes</note> came after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there was Abenner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped along round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>And David answered and spoke to Abimelech the Chettite, and to Abessa the son Saruia the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abessa said, I will go in with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abessa go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abenner and his people slept round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>And Abessa said to David, The Lord has this day shut up thine enemy into thine hands, and now I will smite him to the earth with the spear to the ground once for all, and I will not <note>Gr. double the stroke to him</note> smite him again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>And David said to Abessa, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>And David said, As the Lord lives, if the Lord smite him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added to his fathers, do not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray thee, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return <note>kay eautouv; q. d. ehez nous</note> home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and there was a good distance between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>And David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abenner? and Abenner answered and said, Who art thou that callest? <note>Heb. +«to the king’; Alex. «me to the king’</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.15'>And David said to Abenner, Art not thou a man? and who is like thee in Israel? Why then dost thou not guard thy lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy thy lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>And this thing is not good which thou hast done. As the Lord lives, ye are <note>Gr. sons of slaughter</note> worthy of death, ye who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said, Is this thy voice, son David? and David said, I am thy servant, my lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.18'>And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.19'>And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs thee up against me, let thine offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they are cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.20'>And now let not my blood fall to the ground before <note>Gr. the face of the Lord</note> the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek my life, as the night hawk pursues its prey in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.21'>And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt thee, because my life was precious in thine eyes; and to-day I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.22'>And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.23'>And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered thee this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.24'>And, behold, as thy life has been <note>Gr. magnified</note> precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and <note>Gr. shall deliver</note> deliver me out of all affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.25'>And Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son; and thou shalt surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.27'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.1'>And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered for death into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me <note>Gr. into</note> through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.2'>So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.3'>And David dwelt with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.4'>And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.5'>And David said to Anchus, If now thy servant has found grace in thine eyes, let them give me, I pray thee, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does thy servant dwell with thee in a <note>Gr. city reigned over</note> royal city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.6'>And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.7'>And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.8'>And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land <note>The LXX have rendered hrwv …Mlwem of old to Shur, by apo gelamqour</note> from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified cities even to the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.9'>And he smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.10'>And Anchus said to David, On whom have ye made an attack to-day? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.11'>And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.12'>So David had the full confidence of Anchus, <note>Gr. saying</note> who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.28'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.1'>And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David, <note>Gr. thou shalt know surely</note> Know surely, that thou shalt go forth to battle with me, thou, and thy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.2'>And David said to Anchus, Thus now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make thee captain of my body-guard continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.3'>And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.4'>And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.5'>And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.6'>And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.7'>Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.8'>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the divining spirit within thee, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And the woman said to him, Behold now, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off <note>Or, ventriloquists</note> those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why dost thou spread a snare for my life to destroy it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore to her, and said, As the Lord lives, <note>Gr. if injury</note> no injury shall come upon thee on this account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to thee? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom thou has seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said to her, What didst thou perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he was clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer <note>Gr. has hearkened</note> hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called thee to tell me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>And Samuel said, Why askest thou me, whereas the Lord has departed from thee, and taken part with thy neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And the Lord has done to thee, as the Lord spoke by <note>Gr. my hand</note> me; and the Lord will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to thee this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>And the Lord shall deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>And Saul <note>Gr. hasted and fell standing or at his full length; as the Hebrew</note> instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he <note>Gr. ate</note> had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly <note>Lit. hasted; q. d. trepidavit</note> disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, thine handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have <note>i. e., obeyed</note> heard the words which thou has spoken to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>And now hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thine handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and thou shalt be strengthened, for thou wilt be going on thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and slew it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And she brought the meat before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines went on <note>Gr. to or at</note> by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>And the lords of the Philistines said, Who are these <note>The word rbe is here translated; as in Ge 14:13.</note> that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines, Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us <note>Gr. days</note> some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day.</verse>
