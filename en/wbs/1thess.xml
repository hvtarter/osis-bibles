      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that ye were examples to all that believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves show of us what manner of entrance we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as ye know, at Phillippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation was not from deceit, nor from impurity, nor in guile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we were allowed by God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor from men sought we glory, neither from you, nor yet from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As ye know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Wherefore we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For ye are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow-laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timothy came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>Therefore, brethren, by your faith we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, even as we do towards you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>To the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles who know not God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given to us his holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love ye need not that I write to you: for ye yourselves are taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And indeed ye do it towards all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That ye may walk honestly towards them that are without, and that ye may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not precede them who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>Ye are all children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast-plate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore, comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesyings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
