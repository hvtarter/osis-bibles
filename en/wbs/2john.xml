        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the elect lady, and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him happiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that wisheth him happiness, is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</verse>
