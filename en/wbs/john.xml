      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for a witness, to bear testimony of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear testimony of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified concerning him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And of his fullness have we all received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? and he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes' latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw and bore testimony, that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah; which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas; which is, by interpretation, a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants who drew the water knew) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And saith to him, Every man at the beginning presenteth good wine; and when men have well drank, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And found in the temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money, sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence: make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then answered the Jews, and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>And needed not that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no man hath ascended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>That whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou didst bear testimony, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves bear me testimony, that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for to him God giveth not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground, that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in that thou hast spoken truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her waterpot, and went into the city, and saith to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye have entered into their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans had come to him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed, because of his own word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down ere my child dieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend: and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second miracle that Jesus performed, when he had come from Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and agitated the water: whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was cured of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith to him, Wilt thou be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is agitated, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, it is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then answered Jesus, and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever things he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth the dead, and reviveth them; even so the Son reviveth whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment to the Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>And shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that testifieth concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye sent to John, and he testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath borne testimony concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I receive not honor from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can ye believe, who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he performed on them that were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went upon a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them make take a little:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes, as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, This is truly that prophet that should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening had now come, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And entered into a boat, and went over the sea towards Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the boat: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(Yet there came other boats from Tiberias nigh to the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given thanks:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Labor not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said therefore to him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then said they to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the Father's will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught from God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned from the Father, cometh to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is from God, he hath seen the Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am that bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man shall eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Doth this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit that reviveth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, Therefore I said to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we believe, and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for it was he that was to betray him, being one of the twelve.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For neither did his brethren believe in him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>Jesus went to the mount of Olives:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery: and when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself; thy testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself, yet my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am one that testifieth concerning myself; and the Father that sent me, testifieth concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then said the Jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye will die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say, and to judge of you: but he that sent me, is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spoke these words, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When he had thus spoken, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>Therefore they said to him, How were thy eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus, made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thy eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: Why would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When therefore he had heard that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after that he saith to his disciples, Let us ho into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless, let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs distant.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know that even now, whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And whoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She saith to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had so said, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth to the grave to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time his body is offensive: for he hath been dead four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, What do we? for this man performeth many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this he spoke not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then they sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burial hath she kept this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day, many people that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>Took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna; Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples understood not at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning him, and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks among them, that came to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I shall be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(This he said, signifying what death he should die.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and concealed himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus cried, and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And supper being ended (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And went again into the judgment-hall, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then saith Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power against me; except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar's friend. Whoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on each side one, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews then read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw it, testified, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he speaketh truth, that ye may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And there came also Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There they laid Jesus therefore, because of the Jews' preparation-day, for the sepulcher was nigh at hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>So they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And he stooping down, saw the linen cloths lying; yet he went not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and seeth the linen cloths lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then went in also that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept she stooped down to look into the sepulcher,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And seeth two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? she saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And when she had thus said, she turned herself about, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not: for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father hath sent me, even so I send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias: and in this manner did he show himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any victuals? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt on his fisher's coat, (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid upon them, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and notwithstanding there were so many, yet the net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus saith to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He saith to him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; (who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus saith to him, If I will that he shall tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, if I will that he shall tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</verse>
