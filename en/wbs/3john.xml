      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have borne testimony of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou wilt do well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius hath good report by all men, and by the truth itself: and we also bear testimony; and ye know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.\</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.15'>\1:14\Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
