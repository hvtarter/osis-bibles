      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>To which I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>That good thing which was committed to thee keep by the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This thou knowest, that all they who are in Asia are turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things that thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And if a man also striveth for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he striveth lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>In which I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they contend not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Study to show thyself approved to God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man therefore will cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they gender contentions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>This know also, that in the last days perilous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>Having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from such turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly will be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>Persecutions, afflictions which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>And all indeed that will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and seducers will become worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that from a child thou hast known the sacred scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts will they multiply to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>And they will turn away their ears from the truth, and will be turned to fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Do thy diligence to come shortly to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hath departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Luke only is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the copper-smith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>Of whom be thou aware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I have left at Miletum sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
