        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>Because of the savour of thy good ointments (ointment poured forth [is] thy name), therefore have the virgins loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.4'>Draw me after thee, we will run. The king has brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; we will remember thy love more than the wine; the upright love thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>I [am] dark, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, more desirable as the booths of Kedar as the tents of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Do not look upon me because I [am] dark because the sun has looked upon me; my mother's sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards, [but] I have not kept my own vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loves, where thou dost feed, where thou dost make [thy flock] to rest at noon; for why did I have to be as a wanderer after the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go forth, following the footprints of the flock and feed thy little female goats beside the booths of the shepherds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.8'>The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall; he looks through the windows, blossoming through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>the fig tree has put forth her [green] figs, and the vines in blossom have given forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, [that art] in the clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Hunt the foxes [for] us, the little foxes, that spoil the vines; for our vines [are] in blossom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his; he feeds among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>[It was] but a little that I passed from them that I found him whom my soul loves: I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that brought me into the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I charge you, O ye virgins of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye not awake nor stir up love, until he pleases.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made its pillars [of] silver, the bottom of it [of] gold, the covering of it [of] purple, its interior being paved [with] love, for the virgins of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O ye virgins of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves' eyes within thy locks; thy hair [is] as a flock of goats that appear from mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth [are] like a flock [of sheep that are even] shorn, which came up from the washing; of which every one bear twins, and none [is] barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Thy lips [are] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech [is] lovely; thy temples [are] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Thy neck [is] like the tower of David built for teaching, upon which there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>With me from Lebanon, [my] spouse, thou shalt come with me from Lebanon; thou shalt look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>Thou hast taken hold of my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; thou hast imprisoned my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Thy lips, O [my] spouse, drip [as] the honeycomb; honey and milk [are] under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A closed garden [is] my sister, [my] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Thy [newly budded] plants [are] a paradise of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I sleep, but my heart watches [for] the voice of my beloved that knocks [at the door], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect [one]: for my head is filled with dew, [and] my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks [are] as a bed of aromatic spices, [as] fragrant flowers; his lips [like] lilies, dripping sweet smelling myrrh that transcends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands [are as] gold rings set with beryls; his belly [is as] bright ivory overlaid [with] sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs [are as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold; his countenance [is] as Lebanon, chosen as the cedars.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove is [but] one, my perfect [one]; she [is] the [only] one of her mother, she [is] the choice [one] of her that brought her into the light. The virgins saw her and called her blessed; [yea], the queens and the concubines and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who [is] she [that] shows herself forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, [and] imposing as the standard-bearer [of the army]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, [and] to see whether the vines flourished, [and] the pomegranates budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me return [like] the chariots of Amminadib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? [She shall be] as a multitude of tabernacles.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes [that are] twins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Thy neck [is] as a tower of ivory; thine eyes [like] the fishpools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim; thy nose [is] as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Thine head upon thee [is] like scarlet, and the hair of thine head like the purple of the king hung in the galleries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vines flourish, [whether] the tender flowers appear, if the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give thee my loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes have given their fragrance, and at our gates [are] all manner of sweet [fruits], new and old, [which] I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>O that thou [wert] as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! [when] I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; and I should not be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead thee [and] bring thee into my mother's house, that [thou] would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal upon thine heart as a sign upon thine arm; for love [is] strong as death; jealousy [is] hard as Sheol; the coals thereof [are] coals of fire, [which have a] most vehement flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>The many waters cannot quench love, neither can the rivers drown it; if [a] man would give all the substance of his house for this love, it would certainly be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she [still] has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she [is] a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver; and if she [is] a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.10'>I [am] a wall, and my breasts like towers since I was in his eyes as the one that found peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.11'>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; for its fruit each one was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
