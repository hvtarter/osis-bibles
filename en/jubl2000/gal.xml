        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, apostle (not from men neither through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren who are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace [be] unto you and peace from God the Father and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>unto whom [be] the glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>for there is not another; but there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But [even] if we, or an angel from heaven, were to preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be anathema.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we said before, so do I say now again, If anyone preaches any other gospel unto you than what ye have received, let him be anathema.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now persuade men or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known unto you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I did not received it nor learn it from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in Judaism, how that beyond measure I was persecuting and destroying the church of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And profited in Judaism above many of my equals in my own nation, being exceedingly more zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called [me] by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>but they had only heard, That he who persecuted us in time past now preaches the faith which he once destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with [me] also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>But I went up by revelation and communicated unto them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who seemed to be of repute, to not run, or have run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>And that in spite of the false brethren, who entered secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>Unto whom we did not submit even for one hour that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But of these who seemed to be of repute, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God does not accept the appearance of men), for those who seemed [to be of repute] in conference added nothing to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But to the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] unto Peter</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for he that showed himself forth in Peter for apostleship of the circumcision, the same also showed himself forth in me toward the Gentiles);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we [should go] unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>Only [they asked] that we should remember the poor; the same which I was also diligent to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles, but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, dost live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by [the] faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of [our] sin? No, in no wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a rebel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For through the law I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not reject the grace of God, for if righteousness [comes] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that ye should not trust in the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the [obedient] ear of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so foolish? having begun by the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He therefore that gives unto you the Spirit and does works of power among you, [does he do it] by the works of the law or by the [obedient] ear of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know ye therefore that those who are of faith, the same are the sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized Abraham in advance, [saying], In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident, for The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>And the law is not of faith, but The man that does [the commandments] shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangs on a tree),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men) Even when a covenant is of man, once it is confirmed, no one cancels it or adds to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He did not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say [that regarding] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel it, that it should make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance [is] of the law, [it is] no longer of promise; but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>For what then [serves] the law? It was added because of rebellions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made, [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>[Is] the law then against the promises of God? No, in no wise, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Therefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But when faith is come, we are no longer under [the hand] of the schoolmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>[Here] there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if ye [are] Christ's, then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say [That] the heir, as long as he is a child differs [in] nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under [the hand] of tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>to redeem those that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>therefore, thou art no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>However then, when ye did not know God ye did service unto those who by nature are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, having known God, or rather being known of God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, in which ye desire again to be in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Ye observe days and months and times and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]; ye have not injured me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>Ye know how through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my affliction which was in my flesh ye did not despise, nor reject but [ye] received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where is then the blessedness ye spoke of? for I bear you record that if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Am I, therefore, become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are zealous after you, [but] not [for] good; they would exclude you [from us], that ye might be zealous after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>It is good to be always zealous to [do] good, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ is formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, have ye not heard the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, but he of the freewoman [was born] through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things are an allegory; for these [women] are the two covenants: the one from the mount Sinai, which begat unto bondage, which is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>For this Hagar or Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which corresponds to the one that is now Jerusalem, which [together] with her children is in bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem of above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth [into praise] and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>So that we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to the Spirit, even so [it is] now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>Nevertheless what does the scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye become circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>For I testify again to every man that becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Ye are empty of the Christ, whosoever of you that justify yourselves by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye did run well; who hindered you that ye should not trust in the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion does not [come] of him that called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will not be otherwise minded, but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offence of the stake ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I even desire that those who trouble you would cut themselves off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only do not [use] liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by charity serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye are not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if ye are led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; which I denounce, as I have also told [you] in time past that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is [this]: Charity, joy, peace, tolerance, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>For those that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if anyone is overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let everyone prove his own work, and then he shall have glory regarding only himself, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For everyone shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let the one that is taught in the word communicate unto the one that teaches in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not deceive yourselves; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows that shall he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sows in the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>Therefore as long as we have the opportunity, let us do good unto everyone, especially unto those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the stake of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But in no wise should I glory, except in the stake of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.:</verse>
