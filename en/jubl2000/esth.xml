  <div type='book' osisID='Esth'>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this [is] Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia [over] one hundred and twenty-seven provinces)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>[That] in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which [was] in Shushan, the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>In the third year of his reign, he made a banquet unto all his princes and his servants, [having] before him the power of Persia and Media, the governors and princes of the provinces, '</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>to show them the riches of the glory of his kingdom and the honour of beauty of his greatness for many days, [even] one hundred and eighty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days were expired, the king made a banquet unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>[There were] white, green, and blue [hangings], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble; the beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of porphyre and of marble and of alabaster and of blue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another) and royal wine in abundance, according to the power of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drink [was] according to this law: let no one constrain themselves; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to the will of each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Likewise Vashti, the queen, made a banquet for the women [in] the royal house of King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs that served in the presence of Ahasuerus, the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring Vashti, the queen, before the king with the crown of the kingdom, to show the people and the princes her beauty, for she [was] fair to behold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's word by [his] eunuchs; therefore, the king was very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king asked the wise men, who knew the times, (for so [was] the king's manner toward all that knew [about] the law and rights,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>and the next to him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, [and] who sat first in the kingdom;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to law because she has not performed the decree of King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti, the queen, has not only committed iniquity against the king, but also against all the princes and against all the people that [are] in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For [this] deed of the queen shall be [known] abroad unto all the women so that they shall despise their husbands, saying, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti, the queen, to be brought in before him, but she did not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>And now the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen shall say [this] unto all the king's princes, and [there shall be] much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it pleases the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, That Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And this sentence which the king shall make shall be heard throughout all his empire, although it is great, and all the wives shall give their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And this word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, saying, That every man should bear rule in his own house and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then the king's servants that ministered unto him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan, the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege, the king's eunuch, keeper of the women; and let them be given that which is necessary for [their] purification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>and let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>[Now] in Shushan, the palace, there was a certain Jew, whose name [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he had brought up Hadassah, that [is], Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful; and as her father and mother were dead, Mordecai had taken her for his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan, the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden pleased him, and she found mercy before him; and he speedily gave her that which was necessary for purification and her rations, and seven maidens, [which were] meet to be given her out of the king's house; and he moved her and her maids into the best [place] of the house of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not declared her people nor her birth, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not declare [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know the peace of Esther and what was done with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when each maid's turn was come to go in to King Ahasuerus, after she had been twelve months according to the law [regarding] the women (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [that is], six months with oil of myrrh and six months with aromatic odours and oils for women),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>then thus came [each] maiden unto the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai, the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all those that looked upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and mercy in his sight more than did all the other virgins so that he set the crown of the kingdom upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great banquet unto all his princes and his servants, the banquet of Esther; and he made a release to the provinces [of their taxes] and gave gifts according to the power of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not [yet] declared her birth nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai as when she was being brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth and sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing was known by Mordecai, who told [it] unto Esther, the queen; and Esther notified the king [of this] in Mordecai's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the Chronicles before the king.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that [were] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants that [were] in the king's gate, knelt down and worshipped Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not kneel or worship [before him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king's servants, who [were] in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why dost thou pass over the king's commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he did not hearken unto them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's word would stand; for he had told them that he [was] a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel or worship [before] him, then Haman was filled with wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>And he thought it a small matter to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for now they had declared unto him the people of Mordecai; therefore, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, that [is], the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, before Haman from day to day and from month to month, and the twelfth [month], that [is], the month Adar was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws [are] different from all [other] people; neither do they observe the king's laws: therefore, it [is] not profitable for the king to allow them to remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it pleases the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the public works, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said unto Haman, The silver [is] given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then the king's scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that [were] over each province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and [to] every people after their language; in the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king's ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>The copy of the writing was to be given as law in every province that it be published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The posts went out in haste by the king's commandment, and the law was given in Shushan, the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>and came before the king's gate; for no one was allowed to enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in each province, wherever the king's commandment and his law came, [there was] great mourning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>So Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her. Then the queen was grieved exceedingly, and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he did not receive [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then Esther called for Hatach, [one] of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and sent him to Mordecai, to know what it [was] and why it [was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the plaza of the city, which [was] before the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show [it] unto Esther and to declare [it] unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Again Esther spoke unto Hatach and sent him [to say] unto Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that anyone, whether man or woman, who shall come unto the king into the inner court without being called [by] one law shall be put to death, unless the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that they may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai told [them] to answer Esther, Do not think in thy soul that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if thou art silent at this time, [then] enlargement and deliverance shall arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed; and who knows whether thou art come to the kingdom for [such] a time as this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther told [them] to return Mordecai [this answer],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so I will go in unto the king, even though [this is] not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai went and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on [her] royal [apparel], and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it was so, when the king saw Esther, the queen, standing in the court, [that] she had grace in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that [was] in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then the king said unto her, What wilt thou, Queen Esther? And what [is] thy request? It shall be given thee, even to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther answered, If [it seems] good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. What [is] thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then answered Esther and said, My petition and my request [is]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found grace in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate [and] that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself, and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his sons and all [the things] in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>Haman said, moreover, Even Esther, the queen, let no one come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow I am also invited by her with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai, the Jew, sitting at the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then said Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it; then go in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the Chronicles, and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, the keepers of the door, who had sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done unto Mordecai for this? Then the king's servants who ministered unto him answered, Nothing has been done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let [the] royal apparel be brought which the king wears, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown which is set upon his head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that he may clothe the man whom the king delights to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, [and] take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do so unto Mordecai, the Jew, that sits at the king's gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>Then Haman took the apparel and the horse and clothed Mordecai and brought him on horseback through the plaza of the city and caused it to be proclaimed before him, Thus shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>After that Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning and having his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman told Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends all that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh, his wife, said unto him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>And while they [were] yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came in haste to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman came to [the] banquet with Esther, the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition, Queen Esther? And it shall be granted thee. What is thy request? And it shall be performed, [even] to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then Esther, the queen, answered and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, O king and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. If we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would remain silent, even though the enemy could not recompense the damage to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>And King Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther, the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that has filled his heart [with the arrogance] to do so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>Then Esther said, The man [who is the] adversary and enemy [is] this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath [went] into the palace garden, and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther, the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, and Haman had fallen upon the bed upon which Esther [was]. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? When this word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>Then said Harbonah, one of the eunuchs before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, unto Esther, the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he [was] unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>And Esther spoke yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the evil of Haman, the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>And said, If it pleases the king and if I have found grace in his sight and if the thing is right before the king and if I am good in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who [are] in all the king's provinces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my nation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>Then King Ahasuerus said unto Esther, the queen, and to Mordecai, the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him upon the gallows because he extended his hand against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may not be revoked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>Then the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month, that [is], the month Sivan, on the twenty-third [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews and to the lieutenants and the captains and the princes of the provinces which [are] from India unto Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, unto each province according to the writing thereof, and unto each people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>And he wrote in King Ahasuerus' name and sealed [it] with the king's ring and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders on mules, mules that were born of mares,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>that the king granted [power] to the Jews who [were] in all the cities to gather themselves together and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish any army of the people or province that would assault them, [and even their] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>upon the same day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, [namely], upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is] the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>The copy of the writing which was to be given as law in each province [was] published unto all people and [said] that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>[So] the posts rode upon mules, they went out on mules, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the law was given at Shushan, the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a mantel of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And in each province and in each city wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a banquet and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>Now in the twelfth month, that [is], the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his law drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to the contrary; for the Jews took dominion over those that hated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>And all the princes of the provinces and the lieutenants and the captains and officers of the king helped the Jews because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For Mordecai [was] great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces, for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>And in Shushan, the palace, the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>[Then they also slew] Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha; the enemy of the Jews, they slew, but on the spoil they did not lay their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>On the same day the number of those that were slain in Shushan, the palace, was brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And the king said unto Esther, the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan, the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is thy petition, and it shall be granted thee? What is thy request further, and it shall be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who [are] in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And the king commanded it to be so done; and it was given as law at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>And the Jews that [were] in Shushan gathered themselves together also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the spoil they did not lay their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>And the other Jews that [were] in the king's provinces also gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy-five thousand, but they did not lay their hands on the spoil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of banquet and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But the Jews that [were] at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested and made it a day of banquet and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>Therefore, the Jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and banquet and a good day and of sending portions one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the Jews that [were] in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, [both] near and far,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>to establish [this] among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of banquet and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews accepting this began to do as Mordecai had written unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that [is], the lot, to consume them and to destroy them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>Therefore, they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, for all the words of this letter and [of that] which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>the Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their [appointed] time each year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>and [that] these days [should be] remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and [that] these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>Then Esther, the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai, the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>to confirm these days of Purim in their times [appointed], according as Mordecai, the Jew, and Esther, the queen, had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the words of the fastings and their cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And the commandment of Esther confirmed these words of Purim, and it was written in the book.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And King Ahasuerus laid tribute upon the land and [upon] the isles of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, unto which the king advanced him, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>For Mordecai, the Jew, [was] next unto King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace unto all his seed.</verse>
