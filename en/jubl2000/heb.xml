        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, having spoken many times and in many ways in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last times spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the brightness of his glory and the [express] image of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For unto which of the angels did he say at any time, Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brought in the firstbegotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But unto the Son [he said], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a rod of equity [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore, God, [even] thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>they shall perish; but thou dost remain; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall never fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels did he say at any time, Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth in service for the love of those who are the heirs of saving health?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore, it is necessary that we with more diligence keep the things which we have heard, so that we do not fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken by [the ministry of] angels was steadfast and every rebellion and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape, if we belittle such great saving health? Which, having begun to be published by the Lord, has been confirmed unto us by those that heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributing them according to his own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For unto the angels he has not subjected the world to come, of which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst make him a little lower than the angels; thou didst crown him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we [do] not see yet that all things are put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see this same Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was expedient that he, for whom [are] all things and by whom [are] all things, preparing to bring forth many sons in [his] glory, should perfect the author of their saving health through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he that sanctifies and those who are sanctified [are] all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For verily he did not take the angels, but he took the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore in all things he should be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that he himself has suffered and was tempted, he is also powerful to help those that are tempted.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, brethren, saints, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to him that appointed him over all his house, as also Moses [was faithful].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honour than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but he that created all things [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses verily [was] faithful over all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ as [a] son over his own house, which house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the glorious hope firmly until the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit saith, Today if ye will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore, I was indignant with that generation and said, They do always err from [their] heart, and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unfaithfulness, to depart from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some of those that came out of Egypt with Moses, when they had heard, did provoke; howbeit not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>But with whom was he indignant forty years? [Was it] not with those that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom he swore that they should not enter into his rest, but to those that disobeyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they could not enter in because of [their] unbelief.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us, therefore, fear, lest a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them, but it did not profit those that heard the word without mixing [it] with faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>(For we who have believed do enter into the rest) as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] like this, And God rested the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And in this [place] again, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Seeing, therefore, it remains that some must enter therein, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>Again, he determines a certain day, [saying], Today, by David so long a time afterward; as it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Jesus had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us therefore make haste to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God [is] alive and efficient and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any created thing that is not manifested in his presence, but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him of whom we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having, therefore, a great high priest who penetrated the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast this profession [of our hope].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we [do] not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted like as [we are], yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of his grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest is taken from among men, constituted on behalf of men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those that are in error; for he himself is also compassed with weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And by reason of this he ought, as for the people so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no one takes this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also the Christ did not glorify himself to make himself high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son; today have I begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he said also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, was heard because of [his] reverent fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>although he was the Son [of God], yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal saving health unto all those that hearken unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>named by God high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Of whom we have many things to say and difficult to declare, seeing ye are hard of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For you should now be teaching [others], if we look at the time, [yet] you need to be taught again which [are] the first elements of the oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For any one that uses milk [is] not qualified in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But strong food belongs to those that are perfect, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving now the word of the beginning [of the establishment] of the Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from works of death, and of faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the doctrine of [the] baptisms, and of [the] laying on of hands, and of [the] resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will indeed do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For [it is] impossible that those who once received the light and tasted of that heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and likewise have tasted the good word of God and the virtue of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and have backslidden, be renewed again by repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it and brings forth herbs in season for those by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but that which bears thorns and briers [is] rejected and [is] near unto cursing, whose end [shall be] by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we expect better things than these of you, [things] near unto saving health, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God [is] not unjust to forget your work and labour of charity which ye have showed in his name, having helped the saints and helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence until the end for the fulfillment of [your] hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that ye not become slothful, but imitators of those who by faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God promised unto Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all controversy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In which God, desiring to show more abundantly unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by two immutable things, in which [it is] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters even [into] that which is within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where [our] precursor, Jesus, has entered for us [and is] made high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom Abraham also gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this one [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And verily those that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they also have come out of the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but he whose descent is not counted in those took tithes from Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without any contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>In the same manner, here men that die take tithes; but there he [received them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And as I may so say, Levi also, who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being transposed, there is made of necessity a translation also of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no one presided [at] the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For [it is] manifest that our Lord sprang out of Juda, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet far more manifest: if there arises another priest who is like unto Melchisedec,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who is not made according to the law of a carnal commandment, but by the virtue of an indissoluble life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>for the testimony is of this manner, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did], by which we draw near unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And [even more], inasmuch as it [is] not without an oath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>(for the others indeed without an oath were made priests, but this one with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much better testament is Jesus made surety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And the others, truly, were many priests because they were not able to continue by reason of death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but this [man], because he continues forever, has the intransmissible priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore he is able also to save to the uttermost those that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For it was expedient that we have such a high priest, [who is] holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people's; for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law makes men high priests who have weakness; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, has made perfect [a] Son forever.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now of the things which we have spoken, [this is] the sum: We have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>[a] minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, [it is] also necessary that this one have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if he were on earth, he should not even be a priest, being present still the other priests that offer gifts according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>(who serve as an example and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was admonished [of God] when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern showed unto thee in the mount);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>but now a more excellent ministry is his, in that he is the mediator of a better testament, which was established upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then no place should have been sought for the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new testament with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the testament that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this [is] the testament that I will ordain to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their soul and write them upon their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>and no one shall teach his neighbour nor anyone his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will reconcile their iniquities and their sins, and their iniquities I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that he says, New, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old [is] ready to vanish away.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Nevertheless the first had [its] justifications of worship and [its] worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For there was a tabernacle made: the first, in which [was] the candlestick and the table and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second veil [was] the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>which had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which [was] the golden urn that had the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the testament,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the seat reconciliation, of which we cannot now speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second the high priest [went] alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for his [own] ignorance, and [for] that of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit signifying in this, that the way into the sanctuary was not yet made manifest, as long as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>Which [was] a figure of that time present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>but in foods and drinks and different washings and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being now come, high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the sanctuary designed for eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of the Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from the works of death to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, so that death intervening for the redemption of the rebellions [that took place] under the first testament, those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity intervene [the] death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament [is] confirmed by the death: otherwise it is not valid as long as the testator lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>From which came that not even the first [one] was dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when Moses had read every commandment of the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God has commanded unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood [there] is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>So that it was necessary that the figures of the heavenly things should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ is not entered into the sanctuary made with hands (which is a figure of the true), but into the heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>nor yet that he should offer himself many times (as the high priest enters into the sanctuary each year with blood that is not his own);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>otherwise it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times since the foundation of the world; but now once in the consummation of the ages he has appeared to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed unto men to die once, and after this the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also the Christ is offered once to take away the sins of many; and unto those that wait for him without sin he shall appear the second time unto saving health.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never make perfect those who come by the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise, they would cease to offer them, because those that sacrifice, once purged, would have no more conscience of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in these [sacrifices] each year [the same] remembrance of sins is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For the blood of bulls and of goats cannot take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore when he came into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire, but a body hast thou prepared me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>in burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then said I, Behold, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou dost not desire, neither hadst pleasure [therein], which are offered by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will, O God. He took away the first, that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>In this will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus, the Christ, once [for all].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And so every priest stands daily ministering and offering many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>but this [man], after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, is seated at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>waiting for that which follows, [that is], until his enemies are made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has perfected for ever those that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>Likewise the Holy Spirit gives us the same witness, who afterwards said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This is the testament that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their hearts, and in their souls will I write them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and [having] that great priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts purified from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>let us hold fast the profession of [our] hope without wavering (for he [is] faithful that promised).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another to provoke unto charity and unto good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking our gathering together, as the manner of some [is], but exhorting [one another] and so much the more, when ye see that day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful hope of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>He that despised the law of Moses died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much greater punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know [who] he [is] that has said, Vengeance [belongs] to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But bring to memory the former days, in which, after ye received the light, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>on the one hand ye were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and on the other ye became companions of those that were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that in yourselves ye have a better substance in the heavens, and that abides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Do not lose, therefore, this your confidence, which has great recompense of reward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>for patience is necessary, so that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>Now the just shall live by faith, but if [any man] draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of those who draw back unto perdition, but faithful unto the saving of the soul.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Faith, therefore, is the substance of things waited for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>Through faith we understand that the ages were framed by the word of God, that which is seen being made of that which was not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found because God had translated him, for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith [it is] impossible to please God; for he that comes to God must believe that he is and [that] he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having received revelation of things not seen as yet, with great care prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and was made heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those that say such things declare plainly that they seek their native country.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.6'>So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.7'>Remember your pastors, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.8'>Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and for the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Be not taken out of the way with diverse and strange doctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with foods which have not profited those that have been occupied with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We have an altar, of which those who serve the tabernacle have no faculty to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Let us go forth, therefore, unto him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one that is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips confessing his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>Do not forget to do good and to fellowship; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Listen to your pastors, and do not resist them, for they watch for your souls as those that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that [is] unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience in all things desiring to conduct ourselves well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>And I beseech [you] all the more to do this, that I may be restored unto you sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal testament,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>And I beseech you, brethren, that ye receive [this] word of exhortation, that I have written unto you briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Salute all thy pastors and all the saints. The [brethren] of Italy salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace [be] with you all. Amen.:</verse>
