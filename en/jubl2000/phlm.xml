Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah).

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy, [our] brother, unto Philemon, our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to [our] beloved [sister], Apphia and Archippus, our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the communication of thy faith may become effectual for the knowledge of all the good that is in you by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in thy charity because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command thee that which is expedient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet for the sake of charity I rather beseech [thee], being such a one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now is profitable to thee and to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I send again unto thee; therefore, receive him, as you would receive me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I desired to retain him with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but I did not want to do anything without thy counsel, that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps for this, he departed from you for a season, that thou should have him again forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged thee or owes [thee] anything, put that on my account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written [it] with my own hand, I will repay [it]; albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Therefore, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord, that thou might refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in thy obedience, I have written unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>In the same manner prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus, salutes thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.:</verse>
