      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac; Isaac begat Jacob; Jacob begat Judas and his brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; Phares begat Esrom; Esrom begat Aram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Aram begat Aminadab; Aminadab begat Naasson; Naasson begat Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; Booz begat Obed of Ruth; Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse begat David the king; David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon begat Roboam; Roboam begat Abia; Abia begat Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa begat Josaphat; Josaphat begat Joram; Joram begat Ozias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Ozias begat Joatham; Joatham begat Achaz; Achaz begat Ezekias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Ezekias begat Manasses; Manasses begat Amon; Amon begat Josias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zorobabel begat Abiud; Abiud begat Eliakim; Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor begat Sadoc; Sadoc begat Achim; Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud begat Eleazar; Eleazar begat Matthan; Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; from the carrying away into Babylon unto the Christ [are] fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: That being, his mother Mary espoused to Joseph (before they came together) she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being just and not willing to expose her publicly, desired to leave her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in dreams, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God With Us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? We have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he asked them where the Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea, for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda, for out of thee shall come a Leader that shall shepherd my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, calling the wise men unto him secretly, understood of them [with diligence] the time of the appearing of the star;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go there and search [diligently] for the young child; and when ye have found [him], bring me word again that I may come and worship him [also].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, behold, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it arrived and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And entering into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshipped him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned by divine revelation in dreams that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in dreams, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and remain there until I bring thee word, for Herod will seek the young child to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And awaking, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth and sent forth and killed all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had understood of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Lord through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping and great mourning, Rachel [was] weeping [for] her children and would not be comforted because they perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, [the] angel of the Lord appeared in dreams to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the death of the young child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; notwithstanding, being warned by divine revelation in dreams, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophets, that he shall be called a Nazarene.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, who said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the region round about Jordan went out to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as [our] father, for I say unto you that God is able to raise up children unto Abraham of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now the axe is also laid unto the root of the trees; therefore, every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in [the] Holy Spirit and fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose fan [is] in his hand; and he will thoroughly purge his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with fire that shall never be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John resisted him much, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now, for thus it is expedient for us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, after he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and, behold, a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made [into] bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him up into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said unto him, All these things I will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said unto him, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he returned to Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zepulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zepulun, and the land of Naphtali, [by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sat in darkness saw great light, and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they straightway left [their] nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, he saw another two brothers, James [the son] of Zebedee and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every of sickness and every [bodily] weakness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those who were possessed with devils and those who were lunatic and those that were paralyzed; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, [from] Decapolis, [from] Jerusalem, [from] Judaea and [from] beyond Jordan.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed [are] the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed [are] those that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed [are] the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed [are] those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed [are] the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed [are] the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed [are] the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed [are] those who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye when [men] shall revile you and persecute [you] and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its savour, with what shall it be salted? From then on it is good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye are the light of the world. A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on the lampstand, and it gives light unto all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to undo the law or the prophets; I am not come to undo, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say unto you, Until heaven and earth pass [away], not one jot or one tittle shall pass from the law until all is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever therefore shall undo one of these least commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit murder, and whosoever shall commit murder shall be guilty of the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother out of control shall be in danger of the judgment, and whosoever shall insult his brother shall be in danger of the council, but whosoever shall say, Thou art impious, shall be in danger of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother has something against thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave thy gift there before the altar, and go; first restore friendship with thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Conciliate with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out of there, until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>Therefore if thy right eye should bring thee occasion to stumble, pluck it out and cast [it] from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand should bring thee occasion to stumble, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It was also said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not perjure thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is God's throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatsoever is more than this comes of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>but I say unto you, That ye resist not with evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if anyone desires to sue thee at the law, and take away thy clothing, let him have [thy] cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the princes of the priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled together in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and took counsel that they might take Jesus by guile and kill [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came unto him having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat [at the table].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when his disciples saw [it], they became indignant, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, understanding this, said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did [it to prepare] for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Verily I say unto you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the princes of the priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And taking the cup and having given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And he went a little further and fell on his face, praying and saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he came unto the disciples and found them asleep and said unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came unto his disciples and said unto them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he yet spoke, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the princes of the priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And forthwith he came to Jesus and said, Receive joy, master; and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, why art thou come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out [his] hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place, for all those that take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said [it]; nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face and buffeted him, and others smote [him] with the staves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ; who is he that smote thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter sat outside in the patio; and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him and said unto those that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a while those that stood by came unto [him] and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them, for thy speech makes thee manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately a cock crew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there ye shall see him; behold, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Receive joy. And they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said unto them, Be not afraid; go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now when they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large [amount of] money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole him [away] while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were taught, and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, behold, I am with you always [even] unto the end of the age. Amen.:</verse>
