      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear; and raise my voice unto thee because of the violence, and thou wilt not save?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity and cause [me] to behold grievance and destruction and violence before me, in addition to those that raise up strife and contention?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law is weakened, and the judgment does not go forth true: for the wicked compasses about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Behold among the Gentiles and regard and wonder marvelously, for a work shall be done in your days [which] ye will not believe, though it be told [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which march through the breadth of the earth to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] not theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>She [is] terrible and dreadful: from her herself shall go forth their rights and their grandeur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses shall be swifter than tigers and are sharper than the evening wolves, and their horsemen shall multiply themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as eagles [that] hasten to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>All of her shall come for the prey, before their faces an east wind, and they shall gather the captives as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And he shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto him, he shall deride every fortress and shall heap dust and take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then he shall become arrogant [against God], and he shall pass ahead and shall be [found] guilty, [imputing] this his power unto his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>[Art] thou not from the beginning, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not die, O LORD, thou hast ordained him for judgment, and thou hast established him strong for chastisement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity: why dost thou look upon those that deal treacherously [and] hold thy tongue when the wicked devour [the man that is] more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>And dost make men as the fishes of the sea, as reptiles [that have] no lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>He shall take up all of them with [his] hook; he shall catch them in his net and gather them in his drag: therefore, he shall rejoice and be glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore, he shall sacrifice unto his net and burn incense unto his drag because by them his portion [is] fat, and his food plenteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall he therefore empty his net, or have pity to [stop] slaying Gentiles continually?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand upon my watch and affirm my foot upon the fortress and will watch to see what he will say in me and what I shall answer to my question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And the LORD answered me and said, Write the vision and make [it] plain upon tables that he may run that reads it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it because it will surely come; wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, he whose soul is not upright in him [will] become filled with pride, but the just in his faith shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>Even more than he who is given over to wine, [the] transposer, the proud man, shall not remain, who enlarges his desire as Sheol and [is] as death and cannot be satisfied, but gathered unto him all the Gentiles and heaps unto him all the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting enigma against him and say, Woe to him that multiplied [that which was] not his! And [for] how long would he pile thick clay upon himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake those that shall take thy place, and thou shalt be for a prey unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the other peoples shall spoil thee because of human blood and [for] the robberies of the land, of the cities, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe to him that covets illgotten gain by violence for his house that he may set his nest on high, that he may escape from the power of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>Thou hast taken shameful counsel for thy house by cutting off many peoples and hast committed a sin against thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe to him that builds the city with blood and founds the village with iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>[Is] this not of the LORD of the hosts? Therefore the peoples shall labour for the fire, and the Gentiles shall weary themselves in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe unto him that gives his neighbours drink, that puts thy bottle to [them], and makes [them] drunken also, that thou may look on their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>Thou hast filled thyself with dishonour instead of honour; drink thou also, and thy foreskin shall be uncovered; the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful vomit [shall fall] upon thy glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence of Lebanon shall fall upon thee and the destruction of the [wild] beasts shall break thee, because of the human blood, and of the robbery of the land, of the cities, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>Of what profit [is] the graven image that its maker has sculpted; the molten image, that teaches lies, so that in making dumb images the maker trusts in his work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Can it ever teach? Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all within it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But the LORD [is] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>[A] prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, because of all the ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O LORD, I have heard thy word [and] was afraid; O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the times; in the midst of the times make it known; in wrath remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God shall come from Teman, and the Holy [One] from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was filled with his praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand; and there [was] hidden his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>Before his face went mortality, and burning coals went forth from his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood and measured the earth; he beheld and drove out the Gentiles; and the ancient mountains crumbled, the ancient hills; the ways of the world bowed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan as nothing, [and] the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Oh LORD, wast thou displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath even against the sea when thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of saving health?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>Thy bow was entirely uncovered, and the oaths unto the tribes, eternal word, when thou didst divide the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the waters passed by; the abyss uttered its voice; the deep lifted up its hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun [and] the moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>Thou didst tread upon the land in wrath; thou didst thresh the Gentiles in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>Thou didst go forth to save thy people, to save with thine anointed; thou didst shatter the head of the house of the wicked by uncovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>Thou didst strike through with his staffs the heads of his villages, who as a whirlwind attempted to scatter me; their pride [was] as to devour the poor secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>Thou didst make a way through the sea for thine horses [through] the heap of great waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my seat, that I might rest in the day of trouble when he comes up unto the people to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>Because the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] on the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the cultivated fields shall yield no food; the sheep shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will joy in the God of my saving health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and upon my high places he will cause me to walk victorious in my instruments of music.:</verse>
