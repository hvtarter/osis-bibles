        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in [the] truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I wish that thou be prospered in all things and be sound, even as thy soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou dost walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my sons walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest regarding the brethren and with the strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who have borne witness of thy charity before the church, whom if thou wilt help them as is convenient according to God, thou shalt do well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because for his name's sake, they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We, therefore, ought to receive such, that we might be fellow workers to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote unto the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come, I will cause his deeds to be understood, speaking against us with malicious words, and not content with this, he does not receive the brethren and forbids those that desire to receive them and casts [them] out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God, but he that does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Everyone gives testimony of Demetrius, even the truth itself; and we also bear witness, and ye have known that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>For I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] to thee. [Our] friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.:</verse>
