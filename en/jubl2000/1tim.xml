      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God, our Saviour and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>unto Timothy, true son in the faith, Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>Even as I besought thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou might charge some that they not teach diverse doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which generate questions [other than] that the edification of God is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and [of] a good conscience and [of] faith unfeigned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which some, having swerved, have turned aside unto vanity of words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor from where they affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law [is] good, if a man uses it legitimately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly sinners, for the evil and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for fornicators, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, but I was received unto mercy because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of acceptation by all that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But for this cause I was received unto mercy that in me first, Jesus Christ might show forth all clemency, for an example to those who should hereafter believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Therefore unto the King forever, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, so that according to past prophecies regarding thee, that thou by them might war a good warfare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding fast faith and a good conscience, which some, having cast away, have shipwrecked in [their] faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings, and [for] all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and integrity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this [is] good and pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who desires that all men be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For [there is only] one God and likewise [only] one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself in ransom for all, the testimony of which [was confirmed] at the time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>of which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ [and] do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire, therefore, that the men in every place, pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In like manner also that the women adorn themselves in an honest manner, with shyness and modesty, not with ostentatious hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but with good works (as becomes women professing godliness).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let the woman learn, becoming silent in all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>For I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over a [mature] man, but to be at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived in the rebellion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continues in faith and charity and sanctification and modesty.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>The Word is faithful, If anyone desires the office of a bishop [to be a pastor or elder in the church], he desires a difficult ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>It is expedient, therefore, that the bishop be blameless, the husband of [only] one wife, vigilant, temperate, of [worldly] affections mortified, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not given to wine, not hurtful, not greedy of dishonest gain, but gentle, not contentious, not covetous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a novice lest, being puffed up, he fall into judgment of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have a good report of those who are outside lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise the deacons [must be] honest, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of dishonest gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith [together] with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And let these also first be proved; then let them minister, if they are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>The wives likewise [are to be] honest, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let the deacons be the husbands of [only] one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those that minister well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But if I tarry long, that thou may know how it is expedient to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, listening to spirits of error and doctrines of demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>that in hypocrisy shall speak lies; having their conscience seared as with a hot iron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>they shall forbid to marry and shall command [men] to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and have known the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For everything that God created [is] good, and nothing [is] to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If thou put these things before the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, unto which thou hast attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise profits [a] little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>The Word [is] faithful and worthy of acceptation by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For this we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Command and teach this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, occupy thyself reading, exhorting, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which is given unto thee to prophesy, through the laying on of the hands of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Occupy thyself in these things [with care], for in this is [everything], that thy profiting may be manifest unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine; be diligent in this, for in doing so thou shalt both save thyself and those that hear thee.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father, [and] the younger men as brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let those learn first to govern their house in piety and to recompense their parents, for this is honest and pleasing before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusts in God, and is diligent in supplications and prayers night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>but she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Therefore command these things, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let a widow be placed on the list being not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>having a good testimony of good works, if she has brought up [well her] children, if she has exercised hospitality, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But the younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And reject also the idle, who have learned to wander about from house to house, and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I desire therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, govern the house, giving no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some are already turned back after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any faithful man or woman has widows, let them maintain them and let not the church be charged, that it may relieve those that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders that govern well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The labourer [is] worthy of his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against an elder do not receive an accusation, unless there are two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those that sin rebuke before all, that the others may also fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge [thee] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands suddenly on no one, neither be partaker of the sins of others; keep thyself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men's sins are manifest beforehand, before they come unto judgment, but to others they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise also the good works [of some] are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let all that are under the yoke of slavery count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and [his] doctrine not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And those that have faithful masters, let them not despise [them], because they are brethren, but rather serve them better, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. Teach and exhort this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but is driven mad concerning questions and controversy of words, of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>perverse disputings of men of corrupt understanding, and destitute of the truth, using piety as a source of gain: from such withdraw thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But piety with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>So that, sustenance and covering, let us be content with this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>For those that desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But thou, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, charity, tolerance, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, unto which thou art also called, having made a good profession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who gives life to all things and [before] Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate a good profession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that thou keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>who in his time shall show the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>the only one who has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge those that are rich in this world, that they not be highminded, not placing their hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>[but charge them] to do good, that they be rich in good works, liberal to distribute, willing to communicate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the future, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, turn away from profane voices and vain things and arguments in the vain name of science,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen.:</verse>
