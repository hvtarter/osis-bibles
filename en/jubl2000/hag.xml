      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by [the] hand of Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus speaketh the LORD of the hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not yet come, the time to build the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then came the word of the LORD by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Do you have time, all of you, to dwell in your panelled houses, and this house [is] deserted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>Ye have sown much and bring in little; ye eat, but ye are not filled; ye drink, but ye are not satisfied; ye clothe yourselves, but you are not warm; and he that is a hireling receives his wages in a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house; and I will place my will in her, and I will be glorified, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>Ye look for much and find little; and [when] ye lock it up at home, I shall blow upon it. Why? said the LORD of the hosts. Because my house is deserted, and ye run each one of you unto his [own] house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore the rain of the heavens over you is held back, and the earth has held back her fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought upon this land and upon the mountains and upon the wheat and upon the wine and upon the oil and upon [that] which the earth brings forth and upon the men, and upon the beasts and upon every labour of hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, heard the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people feared before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then spoke Haggai the ambassador of the LORD in the embassy of the LORD unto the people, saying, I [am] with you, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And the LORD woke up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked in the house of the LORD of the hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh [month], in the twenty-first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of the prophet Haggai, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who [is] left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see her now? [Is] she not as nothing before your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, said the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of this land, said the LORD, and work; for I [am] with you, said the LORD of the hosts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt and my Spirit is in the midst of you: do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts said: Yet even once, and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry [land];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>and I will shake all the Gentiles; and the desire of all the Gentiles shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver [is] mine, and the gold [is] mine, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of the hosts, and in this place I will give peace, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the twenty-fourth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Ask now the priests [concerning] the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>If one bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread or pottage or wine, or oil or any food, shall it be [made] holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then Haggai said, If [one that is] unclean by a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then Haggai answered, and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before me, said the LORD; and so [is] every work of their hands, and all that they offer here [is] unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now, I pray you, consider in your heart from this day forth, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>since these [things] were: when [one] came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were [but] ten; when [one] came to the pressfat to draw out fifty [vessels] out of the press, there were [but] twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I smote you with [the] east wind and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands, yet ye did not [turn] to me, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Consider now in your heart from this day forth, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], [even] from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, put your heart into [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is not the seed yet in the barn? Not even the vine, nor the fig tree, nor the pomegranate, nor the olive tree, has blossomed yet, but from this day will I bless [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And the word of the LORD came the second time unto Haggai in the twenty-fourth [day] of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I cause the heavens and the earth to shake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>and I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles, and I will overthrow the chariot and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, said the LORD of the hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make thee as a signet ring; for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of the hosts.:</verse>
