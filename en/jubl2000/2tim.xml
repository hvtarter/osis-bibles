      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace of God the Father and of Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with [a] pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>greatly desiring to see thee (being mindful of thy tears), that I may be filled with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>Therefore I admonish thee that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of strength and of love and of temperance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore be not thou ashamed [to give] testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel by the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who has saved us and called [us] with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and has brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>unto which I am appointed [a] preacher and [an] apostle and [a] teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and charity which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>Keep the good deposit committed [unto thee] by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This, thou knowest, that all those who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>for when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day; and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Thou, therefore, work hard as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of [this] life, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And also if anyone contends [in public contest], he is not crowned, except he contends legitimately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The husbandman, in order to receive the fruits, must first work hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Understand what I say, that the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in which I suffer trouble, like unto an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the saving health which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>[This is] a faithful word: That if we are dead with [him], we shall also live with [him];</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]; if we deny [him], he also will deny us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we are unfaithful, [yet] he remains faithful; he cannot deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Counsel these things, charging [them] before the Lord. Strive not in words that profit nothing, [but rather] subvert the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that has nothing to be ashamed of, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But avoid profane [and] vain wordiness, for it will develop into ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And that word will eat away as gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past and [have] overthrown the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay, and likewise some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man, therefore, purges himself from these things, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and profitable for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee also youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But foolish and unwise questions refuse, knowing that they do beget contentions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>That the servant of the Lord should not be contentious, but be meek unto everyone, apt to teach, patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>that with meekness they might teach those that resist, if God peradventure will grant unto them that they might repent and know the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and [that] they may become converted out of the snare of the devil, in which they are captive to do his will.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For there shall be men who are lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, evil speakers, disobedient to their parents, unthankful, impure,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, without temperance, without meekness, without goodness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, rash, puffed up, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having the appearance of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with various lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And in the manner that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men of corrupt understanding, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they shall not prevail, for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as that of those also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, persecutions I have endured, and the Lord delivered me out of [them] all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall also suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and [in that which] has been entrusted unto thee, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto saving health by [the] faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge [thee], therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead in his appearing and in his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Preach the word; be instant in season [and] out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, they shall heap up unto themselves teachers who shall speak to them according to their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and thus they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth and shall return unto fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But watch thou in all things, labour, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my release is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>from now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all those also that love his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Procure to come shortly unto me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak that I left at Troas in the house of Carpus, when thou comest, bring [with thee] and the books, [but] especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom be thou ware also; for he has greatly resisted our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first answer no one stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: let it not be imputed unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known and [that] all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I have left at Miletum sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Procure to come before winter. Eubulus greets thee, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit. Grace [be] with you. Amen.:</verse>
