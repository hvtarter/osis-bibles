        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, apostle of Jesus, the Christ, to the strangers scattered in Pontus, in Galatia, in Cappadocia, in Asia, and in Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>chosen (according to the foreknowledge of God the Father) in sanctification of the Spirit, to obey and be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus, the Christ, Grace and peace, be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Praised [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, who according to his great mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ, from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>unto the incorruptible inheritance that cannot be defiled and that does not fade away, conserved in the heavens for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who are kept in the virtue of God by faith, to attain unto the saving health which is made ready to be manifested in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In which ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are afflicted in diverse temptations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold (which perishes, nevertheless it is tried with fire), might be found unto praise and glory and honour when Jesus, the Christ, is made manifest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though at present ye see [him] not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the end of your faith, [even] the saving health of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Of which saving health the prophets, (who prophesied of the grace that was to come in you) have enquired and searched diligently;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching when and in what point of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, which announced beforehand the afflictions that were to come upon the Christ, and the glory that should follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did administer the things, which are now announced unto you by those that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore, having the loins of your understanding girded with temperance, wait perfectly in the grace that is presented unto you when Jesus, the Christ, is manifested unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient sons, not conforming yourselves with the former desires that you had before in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as he who has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>for it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if ye invoke as Father, he who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, converse in fear the entire time of your sojourning [here],</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that ye have been ransomed from your vain conversation (which you received from your fathers), not with corruptible things [like] silver and gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with the precious blood of the Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without contamination,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>already ordained from before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for love of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who by him do believe God, who raised him up from the dead and has given him glory: that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Having purified your souls in the obedience of the truth, by the Spirit, in unfeigned brotherly love, love one another with a pure heart fervently,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Having therefore left all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all murmurings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babes, desire the rational milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby in health;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if so be ye have tasted that the Lord [is] benevolent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>coming unto whom (is the living Stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, [and] precious),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>ye also, as living stones, [are] built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, well pleasing to God by Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore, also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion the chief corner stone, chosen, precious; and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>Unto you, therefore, who believe [he is] precious; but unto those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, [even to those] who stumble at the word, not obeying in that for which they were ordained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But ye are the chosen generation, [a] royal priesthood, [a] holy nation, [an] acquired people, that ye should show forth the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Ye who in the time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God, who in the time past had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from the carnal desires which war against the soul</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>and have your honest conversation among the Gentiles, so that, in that which they murmur about you as of evildoers, having witnessed [your] good works, they may glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Therefore, be subject to every human ordinance [that is] of the Lord, whether it be to a king or to a superior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>and unto governors as unto those that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those that do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God, that [in] well doing ye may silence the ignorance of vain men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as being free, yet not using [your] liberty to cover maliciousness, but as servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honour all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear, not only to the good and humane, but also to the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this [is] due to grace, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory [is it] if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well and suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this [is] due to grace from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>Because for this were ye called: for the Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, when he was cursed, did not return the curse; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed [himself] to him that judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>he himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose wound ye were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For ye were as sheep that had gone astray, but are now converted unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Likewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands, so that also those who do not obey the Word, may be won without a word by the conversation of their wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>considering your chaste conversation which is in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Let their adorning not be outward with ostentatious hairdos and wearing of gold nor in composition of apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but [let] the interior adorning of the heart be without corruption, and of an agreeable spirit and peaceful, which is precious in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who waited upon God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom ye are made daughters, doing well and not being afraid of any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] wisely, giving honour unto the woman, as unto a more fragile vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>And finally, [be ye] all of one consent, of one affection, loving each other fraternally, merciful, courteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil or curse for curse, but to the contrary, blessing, knowing that ye are called, that ye should possess a blessing by inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For he that desires to love life and see the good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>let him separate himself from evil and do good; let him seek peace and follow it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord [is] against those that do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who [is] he that can harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But also if ye suffer anything for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye]; therefore, be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and [be] ready always to respond to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and reverence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, so that in that which they murmur against you as of evildoers, those that blaspheme your good conversation in the Christ may be confused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For [it is] better (if the will of God so desires) that ye suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For the Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which he also went and preached unto the imprisoned spirits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>which in the time past were disobedient, when once the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was [being] made ready, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>Unto the figure of which the baptism that does now correspond saves us (not taking away the uncleanness of the flesh, but giving testimony of a good conscience before God) by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having ascended into heaven, unto whom the angels and the authorities and powers are subject.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Since the Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, be ye also armed with the same thought; for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>so that now the time that remains in the flesh, he might live, not unto the lusts of men, but unto the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For it should suffice us that during the time past of [our] life we had done the will of the Gentiles, when we conversed in lasciviousness, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, orgies, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>And it seems strange to those that speak evil of you, that ye do not run with [them] to the same unchecked dissolution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>the same shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>Because for this cause was the gospel preached also to those that are dead, that they might be judged in flesh according to men, but live in spirit according to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is at hand; be ye, therefore, temperate and watch unto prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall cover [a] multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Lovingly be hospitable one to another without murmuring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>Let each one according to the gift that he has received, administer it unto the others, as a good steward of the diverse graces of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as the oracles of God; if anyone ministers, [let them do it] according to the virtue which God gives, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus, the Christ, unto whom is glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, think it not strange when you are tried by fire (which is done to prove you) as though some strange thing happened unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of the afflictions of the Christ, so that also in the revelation of his glory, ye may rejoice in triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed [are ye]; for the glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you; certainly on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>So let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or as desirous of the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For it is time that the judgment begins from the house of God; and if [it] first [begins] with us, what shall the end [be] of those that do not obey the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, where shall the unfaithful and the sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore, let those that are afflicted according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls [unto him] as unto a faithful Creator, doing good.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>The elders who are among you I exhort (I am also an elder with them and a witness of the afflictions of the Christ, and also a participant of the glory that shall be revealed).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Feed the flock of God which is among you, caring for her, not by force, but willingly; not for shameful lucre, but with willing desire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>and not as having lordship over the heritage of the Lord, but in such a manner as to be examples of the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the great Prince of the pastors shall appear, ye shall receive the incorruptible crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, young people, be subject to the elders in such a manner that you are all subject to one another. Be clothed with humility of will, for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your cares upon him, for he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be temperate and vigilant because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>resist him steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are to be accomplished in the company of your brethren that are in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus, the Christ, after ye have suffered a little while, he himself perfects, confirms, strengthens, and establishes [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, a faithful brother; (according to my reckoning) I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>The [church that is] at Babylon, chosen together with [you], salutes you and [so does] Mark, my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Jesus, the Christ. Amen.:</verse>
