Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah).

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace [be] unto you and peace from God our Father and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will perfect [it] until the day of Jesus Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>Even as it is right for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are joint partakers of my grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray that your charity may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all perception,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>that ye may approve the best, that ye may be sincere and without offense until the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being filled with fruits of righteousness, which [are] by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other [places];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed preach the Christ even [out] of envy and strife, but others also [out] of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>Some preach the Christ [out] of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add tribulation to my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but the others [out] of charity, knowing that I am placed [here] for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, and will even rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this shall become my saving health through your prayer and the nourishment of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live [is] Christ and to die [is] gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour, yet I do not know what to choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am in a strait between [the] two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>nevertheless, to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your glorying in Jesus Christ may be more abundant by my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only let your conversation be as is worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, unanimous, working together for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of saving health and that of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For unto you it is granted regarding Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear [to be] in me.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore if [there is] any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same charity, unanimous, minding the one thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory, but in humility let each esteem others better than themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>[with] each one not looking to their own things, but also to the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, made in the likeness of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore, God also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven and [things] in earth and [things] under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and [that] every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always hearkened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own saving health with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmurings and doubts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that ye may be blameless and innocent, children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>And even if I am poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause ye also have joy and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore, I hope to send him presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier, but your messenger and he that ministered to my needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he had been sick</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick near unto death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I sent him, therefore, the more carefully, that when ye see him again, ye may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and esteem such</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of the Christ he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>It remains, my brethren, that ye rejoice in the Lord. It does not bother me to write the same things to you, and for you [it is] safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, who serve God in spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, having no confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Though I might also have reason to confide in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised the eighth day, of the lineage of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>concerning zeal, a persecutor of the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But those things which were gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>And doubtless I even count all things [as] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not as though I had already attained [it], either were already perfect, but I follow after, if I may lay hold of that for which I have also been laid hold of by the Christ, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I do not reckon to have laid hold of [it] yet, but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind and extending myself unto those things which are ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, in that unto which we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us have the same mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brethren, be imitators of me and consider those who so walk, as ye have us for a pattern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the stake of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end [shall be] perdition, whose God [is their] belly and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who shall transform our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is also able to subdue all things unto himself.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also and [with] my other fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always, [and] again I say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things [are] honest, whatever things [are] just, whatever things [are] pure, whatever things [are] lovely, whatever things [are] of good report, if [there is] any virtue and if [there is] any praise, exercise yourselves in these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to have an abundance; in everything and by all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Notwithstanding ye have done well, that ye did communicate with my tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, chiefly those that are of the Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.:</verse>
