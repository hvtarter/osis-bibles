  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, servant of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>for the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>and has manifested in due times. It is his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, true son in the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus, the Christ, our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou should correct that which is lacking and set in place elders in every city, as I had commanded thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>He who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who can not be accused of dissoluteness, nor insubordinate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For the bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God; not arrogant, not quick to anger, not given to wine, not hurtful, not greedy of dishonest gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, temperate, just, holy, gentle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast the doctrine according to the faithful word, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many insubordinate and vain talkers and deceivers [of souls], especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths it is expedient to stop, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>For unto the pure all things are pure, but unto those that are defiled and unfaithful, nothing is pure, but even their soul and conscience is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God, but in works they deny [him], being abominable and rebellious and reprobate unto every good work.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak thou the things which are expedient unto sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that the aged men be temperate, venerable, prudent, sound in faith, in charity, in tolerance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of honesty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may teach the young women to be prudent, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>[to be] temperate, chaste, good housekeepers, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Young men likewise exhort to be temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in all things showing thyself as an example of good works, in doctrine [showing] integrity, seriousness, purity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that the adversary may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>[Exhort] servants to be subject to their own masters [and] to please [them] well in all [things]; not contradicting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not defrauding, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live temperately, righteously, and godly in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>waiting for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people of his own, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Admonish them to be subject to dominion and power, and to persuade [those who have] authority, that they be quick unto every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>That [they] speak evil of no one, that [they] not be contentious, [but] gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves also were foolish in another time, rebellious, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out abundantly in us through Jesus, the Christ, our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>The Word is faithful, and I desire that thou affirm this constantly, that those who have believed God might be careful to conduct themselves in good works. This is good and profitable unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and debates [concerning] the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that he that is such is subverted and sins, being condemned of his own judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas unto thee or Tychicus, procure to come unto me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on ahead, procuring that nothing be lacking unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me salute thee. Greet those that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.:</verse>
