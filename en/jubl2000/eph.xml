        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah).

      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [things] in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in charity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>having marked out beforehand [the way] for us to be adopted as sons by Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which has over abounded in us in all wisdom and prudence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>that in the dispensation of the fulfillment of the times he might restore all things by the Christ, both those which are in heaven and those which are on earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>in him in whom likewise we have obtained an inheritance, having had [the way] marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>so that we should be to the praise of his glory, those of us who first trusted in the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In whom ye also [trusted], hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your saving health; in whom also after ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and charity unto all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>illuminating the eyes of your understanding, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what [are] the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, by the operation of the power of his strength,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which operated in the Christ, raising him from the dead and setting [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And has put all [things] under his feet and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is his body, and he is the fullness of her: who fills all things in everyone.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And [he has made] you [alive], who were dead in trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the [will of the] prince of the power of this air, the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath, even as [all] the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great charity with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even as we were dead in sins, he has made us alive together with the Christ (by [whose] grace ye are saved)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and has raised [us] up together and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>Not of works, lest any man should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has prepared that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in [the] flesh, who were called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in [the] flesh, which is made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>but now in Christ Jesus ye who at another time were far off are made near by the blood of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, who of both has made one, breaking down the middle wall of separation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>abolishing in his flesh the enmity, [which was] the law of commandments in the order of rites, to edify in himself the two in one new man, making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and to reconcile both with God by the stake in one body, having slain the enmity thereby;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>and he came and preached peace unto you who [were] afar off and to those that [were] near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Now therefore ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>in whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom ye also are being built together for [the] habitation of God in the Spirit.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has been given to me in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery (as I wrote above in [a] few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>by which, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of the Christ),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in the Christ by the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the operation of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the ages has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>In whom we have security and access with confidence by the faith of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>(of whom the whole family in [the] heavens and on earth is named),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in charity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>may be able to [well] comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know the charity of the Christ, which passes all knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all generations of the ages of the ages. Amen.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation with which ye are called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all humility and meekness, with tolerance, forbearing one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being diligent to guard the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>[There is] one body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who [is] above all and through all, and in you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But unto each one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all the heavens, that he might fulfill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the perfecting of the saints in the work of the ministry, unto [the] edifying of the body of the Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all come forth in [the] unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the coming of age of the Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>That we no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men [and] cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but following the truth in charity, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, the Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and [well] tied together among itself by the nourishment that every [connecting] bond supplies, by the operation of each member according to measure they have received, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say, therefore, and require in the Lord that from now on ye not walk as the other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their [own] senses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who, after losing all sense [of feeling] have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But ye have not so learned of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that ye put off [everything] concerning the old way of life, [that is], the old man who corrupts himself according to deceitful desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and be renewed in the spirit of your understanding</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and that ye put on the new man, which is created in conformity to God in righteousness and in the holiness of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, leaving the lie, speak every man truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be ye angry and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>neither give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands that which is good, that he may have to give to him that is in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for edification, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with which ye are sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be taken away from you, with all malice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another even as God has forgiven you in Christ.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dear children</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and walk in charity even as the Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us [as] an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you as becomes saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>neither dishonest words nor foolishness nor low jesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this ye know, that no fornicator nor unclean person nor covetous man, who is [also] an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Be not ye, therefore, partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For in another time ye were darkness, but now [ye are] light in the Lord: walk as children of light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>(For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>approving what is well pleasing unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which they do in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all these things when they are reproved by the light are made manifest, for the light is that which manifests everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore, be ye not unwise, but understanding of what the will of the Lord [is].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not drunk with wine, in which there is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking among yourselves with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and praising the Lord in your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always for all things unto the God and Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husband, as unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife even as the Christ is head of the church, and it is he who gives saving health to the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Therefore, as the church is subject unto the Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives even as the Christ also loved the church and gave himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might sanctify and cleanse her in the washing of water by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that he might present her glorious for himself, a church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So ought husbands to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord with his church:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless, let each one of you do likewise, let each one so love his wife even as himself, and let the wife [see] that she reverences [her] husband.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>that it may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Servants, be obedient to those that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as unto the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not to be seen as [only] pleasing men, but as the servants of the Christ, doing the will of God from within,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good thing anyone does, the same shall they receive of the Lord, whether [they are] bond or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And, ye masters, do the same unto them, forbearing threats, knowing that their Master and yours is also in heaven and that he is no respecter of persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand [firm] against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the lords of this age, rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Therefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and stand [fast], all [the work having] been finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand [firm], therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate, of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>above all, taking the shield of faith, with which ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching in this with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.19'>and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.20'>for which I am an ambassador in chains, that in this I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.21'>But that ye also may know my affairs [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, shall make known to you all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.22'>whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs and [that] he might comfort your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.23'>Peace [be] to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.24'>Grace [be] with all those that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.:</verse>
