  <div type='book' osisID='1Kgs'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old [and] stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not become warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore, his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin, and let her stand before the king and let her warm him and let her lie in thy bosom, and she shall warm my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel and found Abishag, a Shunammite and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel [was] very fair and warmed the king and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, I will reign, and he prepared chariots and horsemen for himself and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was very handsome; and he had begotten him after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar, the priest who helped Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Shimei and Rei and the mighty men of David did not follow Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which [is] by Enrogel, and called all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but he did not invite Nathan, the prophet, nor Benaiah nor the mighty men nor Solomon his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, reigns without David our lord knowing of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now, therefore, come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel that thou may deliver thine own life and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and enter in unto King David and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee and finish thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag, the Shunammite, ministered unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed and worshipped the king. And the king said, What dost thou desire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said unto him, My lord, thou didst sware by the LORD thy God unto thy handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>and now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, thou dost not know [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>He has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the sons of the king and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the captain of the host; but he has not invited Solomon, thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise, it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted as sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And while she yet spoke with the king, Nathan, the prophet, also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan, the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For today he has gone down and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and Abiathar, the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him and say, [Long] live King Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But he did not invite me, thy servant, nor Zadok, the priest, nor Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, nor thy servant Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then King David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore and said, As the LORD lives, who has ransomed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>even as I swore unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathsheba bowed with [her] face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said, Let my lord King David live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And King David said, Call me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they entered into the presence of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel; and ye shall blow the shofar and say, [Long] live king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>[Afterward] ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne, for he shall reign in my stead, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>Then Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king and said, Amen. Let the LORD God of my lord the king say so [too].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon and let him make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of the oil of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>[Afterward] all the people came up following him, and the people sang with flutes and rejoiced with great joy so [that it seemed] the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests that [were] with him heard [it] when they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why [is this] noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in, for thou [art] a valiant man and bringest good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord King David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>and Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This [is] the noise that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon has been seated on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover, the king's servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king worshipped upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who has given [one] to sit on my throne today, mine eyes even seeing [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests that [were] with Adonijah were afraid and rose up and went each one his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah, fearing the presence of Solomon, arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will show himself virtuous, there shall not one hair of him fall to the ground, but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to King Solomon. And Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon, his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>Keep the charge of the LORD thy God, walking in his ways, keeping his statutes and his commandments and his rights and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou may have understanding in all that thou doest and in everything that thou dost undertake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>that the LORD may confirm the word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, walking before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me [and] what he did to the two captains of the host of Israel, unto Abner, the son of Ner and unto Amasa, the son of Jether, whom he slew, shedding the blood of war in peace and putting the blood of war upon his girdle that [was] about his loins and in his shoes that [were] on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show mercy unto the sons of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table, for they came thus unto me when I fled because of Absalom, thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, [thou hast] with thee Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou [art] a wise man and knowest what thou should do with him, but thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>The days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have a word to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and [that] all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign, but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for by the LORD it was his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of thee, do not deny me. And she said unto him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>Then he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not deny thee) that he give me Abishag, the Shunammite to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba, therefore, went unto King Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; [I pray thee], do not deny me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag, the Shunammite, be given to Adonijah, thy brother, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And King Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag, the Shunammite, for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he [is] my elder brother and he also has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now, therefore, [as] the LORD lives, who has confirmed me, and set me on the throne of David, my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>Then King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And unto Abiathar, the priest, the king said, Go to Anathoth, unto thine own inheritance, for thou [art] worthy of death; but I will not put thee to death today because thou didst bare the ark of the Lord GOD before David, my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD and that he was by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah entered into the tabernacle of the LORD and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said unto him, Do as he has said and fall upon him and bury him that thou may take away from me and from the house of my father the blood which Joab shed without a cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword without my father David knowing of it: Abner, the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall, therefore, return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and fell upon him and slew him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the host; and Zadok, the priest, the king put in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>[Afterward] the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go forth from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be [that] on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said unto the king, The word [is] good as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>But it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants [are] in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went, therefore, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon how Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>Then the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD and protested unto thee, saying, Know for certain, on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad anywhere that thou shalt surely die? And thou didst say unto me, The word [that] I have heard [is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart knoweth well that thou didst to David my father; therefore, the LORD has turned thy wickedness upon thine own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>and King Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>Then the king commanded Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who went out and fell upon him that he died. And the kingdom was confirmed in the hand of Solomon.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon became a relative of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, for he took Pharaoh's daughter [to wife] and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Until then the people sacrificed in high places because there was [still] no house built unto the name of the LORD until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David, his father; only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that [was] the great high place; a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, Ask what [you wish that] I shall give thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.37'>Then he found another man and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him and wounded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.38'>So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with a veil over his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.39'>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king, and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said, Guard this man; if by any means he should get away, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.40'>And when thy servant was busy here and there, he disappeared. Then the king of Israel said unto him, So [shall] thy sentence [be]; thou thyself hast decided [it].</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.42'>And he said unto him, Thus hath the LORD said, Because thou hast let go out of [thy] hand the man of my anathema, therefore, thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.1'>And it came to pass after these things [that] Naboth of Jezreel had a vineyard, which [was] in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.2'>And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it [is] next to my house, and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; [or] if it seems good unto thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.3'>And Naboth replied unto Ahab, The LORD keep me from giving thee the inheritance of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.4'>And Ahab came into his house, sad and angry, because of the word which Naboth of Jezreel had spoken to him, for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>And Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou dost eat no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>And he said unto her, Because I spoke with Naboth of Jezreel and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it; and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>And Jezebel, his wife, said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise [and] eat bread and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed [them] with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that [were] in his city dwelling with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And [then] carry him out and stone him that he may die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>Then the two men, sons of Belial, came in and sat before him; and those men of Belial witnessed against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead that she said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who [is] in Samaria; behold, [he is] in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, Hast thou murdered and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him again, saying, Thus hath the LORD said, In the same place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs also lick thy blood, even thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found [thee] because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee and will burn away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall and he that is kept and he that is left in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked [me] to anger and made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezebel, the LORD has also spoken, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>Him that dies of Ahab in the city, the dogs shall eat, and him that dies in the field, shall the fowls of the air eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>(Truly there was none like unto Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>He was very abominable, following idols, according to all the [things] that the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and slept in sackcloth and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Seest thou how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, [but] in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead [is] ours, and we are late in not taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for the Lord shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there even yet a prophet of the LORD here that we might enquire of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel replied unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah, the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called a eunuch and said, Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, here quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in the plaza at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and he said, Thus hath the LORD said, With these shalt thou push the Syrians until thou have consumed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead and be prospered, for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the king's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger that had gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth; now let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them and speak [that which is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, all that the LORD says unto me, that will I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go and be prospered, for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but [that which is] true in the name of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep without a shepherd; and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return each man to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>Then he said, Hear thou, therefore, the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne and all the host of the heavens standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said in this manner and another said in that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>And there came forth a spirit and stood before the LORD and said, I will persuade him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And the LORD said unto him, In what manner? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him], and prevail also; go forth and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now, therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD has decreed evil concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, went near and smote Micaiah on the cheek and said, Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>Then the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and carry him back unto Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>and say, Thus hath the king said, Put this [fellow] in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. Then he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and enter into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty-two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Surely this [is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it [was] not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>But a [certain] man, shooting his bow in perfection, smote the king of Israel between the joints of [his] coat of mail; therefore, he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand and carry me out of the host, for I am wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle had increased that day, and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians and died in the evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And at the going down of the sun there went a proclamation throughout the camp, saying, Every man to his city and every man to his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, and they also washed his armour; and the dogs licked up his blood, according unto the word of the LORD which he had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>And Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat [was] thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name [was] Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the ways of Asa, his father; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD. Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away, [for] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat and his might that he showed and how he warred, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And the remnant of the male [cult] prostitutes, which had remained from the days of his father Asa, he consumed out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>[There was] then no king in Edom; [there was] a president [instead of a] king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat had made ships in Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, his father, and Jehoram, his son, reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the year seventeen of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>for he served Baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.:</verse>
