        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, [a] servant of God and of the Lord Jesus, the Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>knowing that the proving of your faith works patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>and the patience finishes the work, that ye may be perfect and entire, not lacking in anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>And if any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask of God (who gives abundantly to all, and without reproach), and it shall be given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But ask in faith, not doubting anything. For [he] that doubts is like the wave of the sea which is driven of the wind and is tossed from one side to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For let not such [a] man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>The double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in his high status;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and he who is rich, in his low status, because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beautiful appearance of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man that [patiently] endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither does he tempt anyone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But each one is tempted, when they are drawn away of their own lust and enticed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>He, of his own will, has begotten us with the word of truth, that we should be the firstfruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>So then, leave all uncleanness and remains of malice and receive with meekness the word ingested within you, which is able to cause your souls to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if anyone hears the word and does not put it into practice, this same is like unto the man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>For he considered himself and went his way and in one hour forgot what he was like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But whosoever has looked [attentively] into the perfect law of liberty and has persevered [in it], not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, the same shall be blessed in their deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If anyone among you thinks to be religious and does not bridle their tongue, but deceives his own heart, his religion [is] vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>The pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation [and] to keep thyself unspotted from this world.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus, the glorious Christ, with respect of persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if a man with a gold ring and in precious apparel comes into your synagogue and a poor person in vile raiment also comes in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and ye have respect to him that wears the precious clothing and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there or sit here under my footstool:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Are ye not then judging in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the poor of this world [that they might be] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those that love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But ye have despised the poor. Do not the rich oppress you with tyranny and draw you [with violence] to the courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If ye truly fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are accused of the law as rebels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whosoever shall have kept the whole law, and then offends in one [point] is made guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not murder. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou [commit] murder, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak ye and so do as those that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment without mercy shall be done unto the one that has showed no mercy; and mercy boasts against judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>My brethren, What shall it profit though someone says [that] they have faith and do not have works? Shall this type of faith be able to save them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you says unto them, Depart in peace; be [ye] warmed and filled; but ye do not give them those things which are needful for the body; what [shall it] profit them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Even so faith, if it does not have works, is dead in and of itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But someone may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well; the demons also believe and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But, O vain man, dost thou desire to know that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Dost thou not see how the faith worked together with his works, and the faith was complete by the works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And that the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent [them] out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>My brethren, make not unto yourselves many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For we all offend in many things. If any man offends not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to govern the whole body with restraint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Behold, we put bits ([or restraint]) in the horses' mouths to persuade them, and we govern their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Behold also the ships, which though [they are] so great are driven of fierce winds, yet they are governed with a very small rudder, wherever the governor desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>In the same manner, the tongue is a very small member and boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of beings in the sea may be tamed and is tamed by mankind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>but no man can tame the tongue, which is an evil that cannot be restrained and is full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does a fountain send forth at the same place [both] sweet and bitter [water]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can the fig tree, my brethren, produce olive berries? or the vine, figs? In the same manner no fountain [can] yield both salt water and fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and ready among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, boast not and do not be liars against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but [is] earthly, natural, diabolical.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where there is envy and contention, there [is] confusion and every perverse work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, modest, benevolent, full of mercy and of good fruits, not judgmental, unfeigned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace unto those that make peace.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>Where do the wars and disputes [come] from among you? From here [that is to say], of your lusts which fight in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>Ye covet and have not; ye murder, and have envy and cannot obtain; ye fight and war and have not that which ye desire because ye ask not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore that desires to be a friend of the world, makes himself the enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do ye think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Submit yourselves, therefore, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and [your] joy to heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Murmur not against one another, brethren. He that speaks evil of [his] brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a keeper of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou to judge another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, ye that say, Today and tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>and ye do not know what shall be tomorrow. For what [is] your life? Certainly it is a vapour that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Ye [ought] to say instead, If the Lord wills, and if we live, we shall do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now ye boast in your arrogance; all such glory is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Therefore sin is [still] in the one that knows to do good and does not do [it].:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now, Oh [ye] rich, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches are rotten, and your garments are motheaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver is corrupted with rust; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall completely eat your flesh, as fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped your fields (which you have kept back by fraud) cries out; and the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton; ye have refreshed your hearts, as in the day of slaughter [of sacrifices].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>Ye have condemned [and] murdered the just, [and] he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently until it receives the early and latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be ye also patient and confirm your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Complain not one against another, brethren, that ye not be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we count blessed those who endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very merciful, and full of compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all things, my brethren, do not swear by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath, but let your yes be yes and [your] no, no; lest ye fall into condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is anyone among you afflicted? let them pray. Is anyone happy? let them sing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray for him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>and the prayer of faith shall cause the one who is sick to be saved, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he shall be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess [your] faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be whole. The effectual prayer of the righteous [is] very powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man subject to passions like unto ours, and he asked in prayer that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brethren, if any of you have erred from the truth, and someone should convert him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let [that one] know, that whosoever causes the sinner to convert from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.:</verse>
