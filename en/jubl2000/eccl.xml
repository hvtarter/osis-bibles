        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='Eccl'>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit does a man have of all his labour which he takes under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>[One] generation passes away, and [another] generation comes, but the earth abides for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun arises, and the sun goes down, and with desire returns to his place from which he arises again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goes toward the south and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, there they return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things [are] full of labour; more [than] man can express; the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>The thing that has been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done; and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there [any] thing of which it may be said, See, this [is] new? it has been already of old time which was before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>[There is] no remembrance of former [things]; neither shall there be [any] remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven (this sore travail God has given to the sons of man that they be occupied in it).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>[That which is] crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I communed with my own heart, saying, Behold, I am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all [those] that have been before me in Jerusalem; and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom and knowledge and to know folly and [those who are] mad; I learned [in the end] that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom [is] much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy good things; and, behold, this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, [It is] mad, and of mirth, What does it do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I proposed in my heart to regale my flesh with wine and that my heart would walk in wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made myself great works; I built myself houses; I planted myself vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made myself pools of water, to water with them the forest that brings forth trees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I got [myself] servants and maidens and had sons born in my house; also I had great possessions of cattle and sheep above all that were in Jerusalem before me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered [unto] myself also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I obtained men singers and women singers and [all] the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and those of all sorts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem, and more than that, my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion of all my labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>At last I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned myself to behold wisdom and those [who are] mad, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] that comes after the king? [even] that which has already been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>And I have seen that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man [has] his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness: And I myself also understood that one event happens to the one and to the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>[Then] I said in my heart, As it shall happen to the fool, so it shall happen even to me. Why have I worked until now to make myself wiser? Then I said in my heart that this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever, seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And also the wise [man] shall die the same as the fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>[Therefore] I hated life because [every] work that is wrought under the sun [was] grievous unto me; for all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>[Yea], I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun, which I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knows whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool, he who shall have rule over all my labour in which I have laboured and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun? This [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore my heart began to despair again regarding all the labour which I took under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>That the man who worked with wisdom and with knowledge and with uprightness would have to leave his portion to a man that has not laboured therein. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what does man have of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart in which he has laboured under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days [are only] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>[There is] nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. I also have seen that this [is] from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who can care for himself better than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For God gives to the man that [is] good in [his] sight wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to the one that is good before [God]. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>For all things [there is] a season, and every will under the heaven [has its] time [determined].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit does the one that works have in that in which he labours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men that they may be occupied in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He has made every [thing] beautiful in his time: even the world he has given over to their will, [in such a way] that no man can attain to this work that God makes from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I have learned that [there is] nothing better for them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour; it [is] the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I have understood that whatever God does, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it because God does [it] that [men] should fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which has been is now, and that which is to be has already been and God shall seek that which is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And moreover I saw under the sun [that] instead of judgment, there [was] wickedness; and instead of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for [there is] a time determined [to judge] every will and regarding everything that is done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves [are] beasts one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; and they all have one breath; so that a man has no more [breath] than a beast: for all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all shall turn to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows that the spirit of the sons of men goes upward and that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Therefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So I returned and considered all the violence that is done under the sun and behold the tears of [such as are] oppressed, and they have no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but the [oppressed] had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>And [I thought that] better [is he] than both of them who has not yet been who has not seen the evil works that are done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all travail and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better [is] a handful [with] rest than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I returned, and I saw [another] vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>It is the [man] who is alone, without a successor, who has neither son nor brother; yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity and sore travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two [are] better than one because they have a better reward for their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him [that is] alone when he falls, for [he has] not another to help him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two sleep together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm [alone]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer be admonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For he came out of prison to reign, even though he was born poor into his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I saw all the living who are under the sun walking with the child, the successor that shall stand up in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>[There is] no end of all the people that have been before them; those also that come after shall not be content in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Watch thy feet when thou goest to the house of God and draw near [with] more [willingness] to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know how to do what [God] wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Do not be rash with thy mouth and do not let thy heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God, for God [is] in heaven and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For [out] of much preoccupation comes the dream, and the voice of the fool [out] of a multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When thou dost vow a vow unto God, do not defer to pay it; for [he has] no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou hast vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>[It is] better that thou should not vow than that thou should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it [was] ignorance. Why [should thou cause] God to be angry because of thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>Because dreams abound, and vanities and the words are many, but fear thou God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If thou seest violence unto the poor and [the] extortion of rights and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter, for height is looking upon height; and [there is] one higher than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>And there is higher [authority] in all of the things of the earth, [but] he who serves the field is king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He that loves money shall not be satisfied with money; nor he that loves abundance with increase; this [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When goods increase, those that eat them are increased; and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, except the beholding [of them] with their eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of the servant [is] sweet whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is [another] sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>which are lost by evil pursuits and to the sons which he has begotten; [there is] nothing left in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>And this also [is] a sore evil; [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>In addition to this, all the days of his life he shall eat in darkness, with much wrath and pain and sorrow sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold therefore the good which I have seen: that good is to eat and to drink and to enjoy of the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it [is] his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Likewise, unto every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, he has also given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>To such a one, God will remove the concerns common [to others], for God shall answer [him] with joy from his heart.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is [another] evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is] very common among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honour so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but the strangers eat it; this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man begets a hundred [sons] and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his soul is not filled with good and also [that] he have no burial; I say [that] an aborted birth [is] better than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For he came in vain and departs unto darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Even though he has not seen the sun nor known [any thing]; this [one] has more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>For though [the other should] live a thousand years twice and has not enjoyed good; both shall surely go to the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and with all this the appetite is not filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what has the wise more than the fool? what [more has] the poor that knows how to walk among the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>It is better to enjoy the good that is present than the wandering of desire; this [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>He that is has been named already; and it is known that he [is] man and that he shall not be able to contend with him that is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Certainly the many words multiply vanity, what more does man have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knows what [is] good for man in [this] life, all the days of the life of his vanity which he causes [to be] as a shadow? for who shall teach the man what shall be after him under the sun?:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name [is] better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>[It is] better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow [is] better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools [is] in the house of pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>The laughter of the fool [is] as the crackling of thorns under a pot, and this [also (the laughter or prosperity of the fool) is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Surely oppression makes a wise man mad, and a gift destroys the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better [is] the end of a thing than its beginning, [and] he who has suffered in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Do not be hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Never say, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Knowledge [is] good with an inheritance and [is] the excellency of those that see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For knowledge [is] a defence, [and] money [is] a defence; but wisdom excels in [that] it gives life to those that have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God; for who can make straight that which [he] has twisted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of good enjoy that which is good, but in the day of adversity open your [eyes and learn]: God also has made the one [(the day of adversity)] before the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perishes for his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongs [his days] by his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Do not be too legalistic; neither make thyself over wise [in thine own eyes]: why should thou destroy thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Do not be hasty [to] condemn, neither be thou foolish: why should thou die in the midst of thy labours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>[It is] good that thou should take hold of this; and also from the other not withdraw thy hand; for he that fears God shall come through with everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty [men] who are in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>For surely [there is] not a just man upon earth that in doing good does not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also do not take to heart all the words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant speak evil of thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>For thine own heart knows that thou thyself likewise hast spoken evil of others many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this I have proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise, but it [was] far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>That which has been is far off and that [which is] exceeding deep, who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly and the madness of error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart [is] snares and nets, [and] her hands [are] bonds; whosoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be held prisoner in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this I have found, saith the preacher, [weighing things] one by one to find out the answer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>which my soul yet seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all those I have not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Behold, this only have I found: that God has made man upright, but they have sought out many perversions.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who [is as] he who knows the interpretation of [all] things? The wisdom of [this] man shall make his face to shine, and the coarseness of his face shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I [counsel thee] to keep the king's commandment and the word of the covenant [that thou hast made] with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Do not be hasty to rebel against him; do not persist in [any] evil thing, for he shall do whatsoever pleases him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>because the word of the king [is his] power and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whosoever keeps the commandment shall experience no evil thing, and a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>Because for every will there is time and judgment, because the evil of man [is] great upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>for he does not know that which shall be; nor when it shall be. Who will teach it to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>[There is] no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [does he have] power over the day of death, and weapons are of no use in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this I have seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: the time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>Then I also saw that [the] wicked who were buried came into remembrance more than those who had frequented the holy place, and these were forgotten in the city where they had worked uprightly. This also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because [the] sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner does evil one hundred times and his [judgment] is prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those that fear God, who fear before his presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>but it shall never be well with the wicked, neither shall his days be prolonged, [which are] as a shadow, because he did not fear before the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is [another] vanity which is done upon the earth: that there are just [men], who are recompensed as if [they had done] according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked [men], who are recompensed as if [they had done] according to the work of the righteous; I say that this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Therefore I commended joy because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry, for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>Therefore I applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also [there is he that] neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>And I have seen regarding all the works of God that man cannot attain [to understand] the work that is being done under the sun, because though a man labours to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find it; even though the wise [man] says that he knows [it], yet he shall not be able to attain it.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>Certainly I applied my heart unto all of this that I might declare all of this: that the righteous and the wise and their works [are] in the hand of God; no man knows either love or hatred by all that [passes] before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All [things come] alike to all: [there is] one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices and to him that does not sacrifice: as [unto] the good so [unto] the sinner; [and unto] him that swears as [unto him] that fears the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This [is] an evil among all [things] that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event unto all; and also that the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For to him that is [still] among the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they shall die, but the dead do not know any thing; neither do they have any more reward, for their memory is placed into oblivion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Even their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion in the age in any [thing] that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go, eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a joyful heart that thy works might be acceptable unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Thy garments shall always be white, and thy head shall never lack ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou dost love all the days which thou art to live in this lake of vanity, which are given unto thee; all the days of thy vanity under the sun: for that [is] thy portion in [this] life, and in thy labour in which thou dost work under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever thy hand finds to do, do [it] with [all] thy might, for [there is] no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, where thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned and saw under the sun that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of prudence, nor yet grace to men of eloquence; but time and chance happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also does not know his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare, so [are] the sons of men snared in the evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>I have also seen this wisdom under the sun, which is important unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>[There was] a little city and few men within it; and a great king came against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no one remembered that same poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then I said, Wisdom [is] better than strength: even though the poor man's knowledge [is] despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of wise [men are] heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom [is] better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: likewise a small act of folly unto him [that is] esteemed for wisdom [and] honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A wise man's heart [is] at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Even when the fool walks by the way, he lacks prudence, and he says unto every one [that] he [is] a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against thee, do not leave thy place; for meekness pacifies great sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is [another] evil [which] I have seen under the sun, as an error [which] proceeds from the ruler:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich are seated in [a] low place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I saw servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He that digs a pit shall fall into it, and whosoever breaks a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whosoever moves the stones shall have tribulation along with it, [and] he that cuts the firewood shall be endangered by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the iron is blunt, and he does not whet the edge, [then he must] put forth more strength, but the advantages of wisdom excel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>If the serpent bites without being enchanted, then the babbler is no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words from the mouth of the wise man [are] grace, but the lips of the fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness, and the end of his talk [is] mischievous madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>The fool multiplies words [and says], Man cannot tell what shall be, and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labour of the foolish wearies all of them because they do not know how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a child, and thy princes banquet in the morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Blessed [art] thou, O land, when thy king [is] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By much slothfulness the building decays, and through idleness of the hands [the rain] drips throughout the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>The banquet is made for pleasure, and wine makes merry; but money answers all [things].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Do not curse the king, not even in thy thought; and do not curse the rich even in the secret [place] of thy bedchamber; for the birds of the air shall carry the voice, and those who have wings shall tell the matter.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.11'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a portion to seven and even to eight, for thou dost not know what evil shall come upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds are full of rain, they shall empty [themselves] upon the earth; and if the tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He that observes the wind shall not sow, and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As thou dost not know what [is] the way of the spirit [nor] how the bones [grow] in the womb of her that is with child, even so thou dost not know the works of God who makes all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.6'>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, either this or that or whether they both [shall be] equally good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.7'>Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] for the eyes to behold the sun,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.8'>but if a man lives many years [and] rejoices in them all; yet if afterwards he remembers the days of darkness, for they shall be many, [he shall say] that everything that shall have happened to him [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.9'>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these [things] God will bring thee into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth [are] vanity.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.5'>[when] they shall also be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and appetite shall fail: because man goes to the home of his age, and the mourners shall go about the streets;</verse>
