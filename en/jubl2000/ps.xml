        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed [is] the man that does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD, and in his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>The ungodly [are] not so but [are] like the chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he shall speak unto them in his wrath and trouble them in his sore displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet I have set my king upon Zion, the mountain of my holiness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The foolish [those who are governed by carnal thoughts or desires] shall not stand in thy sight; thou dost hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>Thou shalt destroy those that speak lies: the LORD will abominate the bloody and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, I will come [into] thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: [and] in thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For [there is] no uprightness in their mouth; their inward part [is] very wickedness; their throat [is] an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out for the multitude of their rebellions; for they have rebelled against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>And all those that put their trust in thee shall rejoice: they shall ever be in jubilee, for thou shalt cover them; and all that love thy name shall be joyful in thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>&lt;&lt;To the Overcomer in Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.&gt;&gt; O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I [am] weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul is also greatly troubled; but thou, O LORD, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.</verse>
