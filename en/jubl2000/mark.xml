  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus, the Christ, Son of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>as it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea and those of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John was clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>and preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed have baptized you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth [a city] of Galilee and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And as soon as he was come out of the water, [John] saw the heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending [and resting] upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my dear Son, in whom I delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the wilderness forty [days and forty nights] and was tempted of Satan and was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye and believe the Gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And straightway they forsook their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when he had gone a little further from there, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they entered into Capernaum, and straightway on the sabbath days he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they marvelled at his learning, for he taught them as one that had power with him, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit tore him and cried with a loud voice and came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? What new doctrine [is] this? for he commands the unclean spirits with power, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>But Simon's mother-in-law lay sick of a fever, and soon they told him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up; and the fever left her by and by, and she ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>In the evening, when the sun was down, they brought unto him all that were diseased and those that were possessed with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place and prayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those that were with him followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also, for truly I came forth for that purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, having mercy on him, put forth [his] hand and touched him and said unto him, I will; be thou clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said unto him, See thou say nothing to any man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to publish [it] much and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capernaum after [some] days, and it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And soon many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as about the door; and he preached the word unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came unto him, bringing a paralytic, carried by four [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not come near unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof [of the house] where he was; and when they had broken it open, they let down the bed in which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this [fellow] so blaspheme? Who can forgive sins but God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And Jesus, knowing afterward in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said unto them, Why think ye these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>What is easier to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (he spoke to the sick of the palsy),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy bed and go to thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And by and by he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like unto this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went again unto the sea; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at the table in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also at the table together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many and they had followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard [it], he said unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees did fast and therefore came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said unto them, Can those who are in a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one mends an old garment with a new piece of cloth, [or] else the new piece that filled it up tears away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; [or] else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are lost; but new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass that as he went through the planted fields [again] on the sabbath day, his disciples began, as they walked, to pluck the ears of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and those that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>So he said unto the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he said unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil? to save the person or to kill them? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And as the Pharisees went forth, they took counsel with the Herodians against him, to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and [from] beyond Jordan. And those who dwell around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many, insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he went up to the mountain and called unto himself whom he would, and they came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he established twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>Simon, whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the [son] of Zebedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed them Boanerges, which is The sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the [son] of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the Canaanite</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him; and they came home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his [friends] and family heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>But the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said that he had Beelzebub and that by the prince of the devils he cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them [unto him] and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If [a] kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if [a] house is divided against itself, that house cannot remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot remain, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and whatever blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness but is obligated to eternal judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>The multitude was sitting all around him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers [and sisters] seek thee without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking round about on those who sat about him, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whosoever doeth the will of God, the same is my brother and my sister and my mother.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And he began again to teach by the sea side, and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea, and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hearken; Behold, the sower went out to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun was up, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth: some thirty and some sixty and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those that were close to him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto those that are without, all [these] things are done in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? How then will ye understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower [is he who] sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are those by the way side, in whom the word is sown, but when they have heard, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And likewise these are those who are sown on stony ground, who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but have no root in themselves and are temporal; afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are those who are sown among thorns, such as hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are those who are sown in good ground, such as hear the word and receive [it] and bring forth fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he also said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed? and not to be set in the lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested; nor secret which shall not be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he also said unto them, Take heed what ye hear; with the measure ye measure by, ye shall be measured by others, and unto you that hear shall more be added.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he that has, to him shall be given; and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He also said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring [forth] and grow up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth brings forth fruit of herself: first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>He also said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs and shoots out great branches, so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables he spoke the word unto them as they were able to hear [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But without a parable he did not speak unto them; and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And that same day, when evening was come, he said unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow; and they awoke him and said unto him, Master, dost thou not care that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And as he arose, he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly and said one to another, Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him a man of the tombs, with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, no, not with chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because many times he had been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been broken in pieces by him, and the fetters shattered; neither could anyone tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and hurting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>Crying out with a loud voice, he said, What hast thou with me, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him, What [is] thy name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send him away out of that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now near unto the mountains there was a great herd of swine feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and all those devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine, and the herd fell over a cliff into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And those that fed the swine fled and told [it] in the city and in the country. And [people] went out to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they come to Jesus and see him that was tormented by the demon and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was entering into the ship, he that had been troubled by the demon besought him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus suffered him not but said unto him, Go home to thy [friends] and family and tell them what great things the Lord has done with thee and [how] he has had mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went and began to publish in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done with him, and everyone marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, a great multitude gathered unto him, and he was near the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And one of the princes of the synagogue came, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death; come and lay thy hands on her that she may be saved, and she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And [Jesus] went with him; and [a] great multitude followed him and thronged him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>when she had heard of Jesus, came from behind among the multitude and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith has made thee saved; go in peace and remain whole of thy plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's [house certain] who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said unto the prince of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they came to the house of the prince of the synagogue and saw the tumult and those that wept and wailed greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he was come in, he said unto them, Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and the mother of the damsel and those that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking the damsel by the hand, he said unto her, Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out from there and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and of Juda and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went through the villages round about, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called [unto him] the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power [over] the unclean spirits</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when night was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up unto them into the ship, and the wind ceased; and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came forth and began to argue with him, demanding of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>So, taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting into his eyes and putting his hands upon [them], he asked him if he saw anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And looking, he said, I see men; I see that they walk as trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>After that, he put [his] hands again upon his eyes and caused him to see; and he was whole and saw everyone, far away and clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>And they answered, John the Baptist; but some [say], Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Then he said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said unto him, Thou art the Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he commanded them that they should tell no one of [this] regarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them that it was convenient that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and [of] the princes of the priests and of the scribes, and be killed and after three days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>And he spoke this word clearly. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>And he, turning about and looking at his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get thyself from me, Satan, for thou knowest not the things that are of God, but the things that [are] of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>And calling the multitude [unto him] with his disciples, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about [it] and dug [a place for] the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to lay hold on him but feared the multitude, for they understood that he had spoken the parable against them, and leaving him, they went away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art [a] man of truth [who] regards no man; for thou dost not look upon [the] appearance of men, but dost with truth teach the way of God; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we give or shall we not give? Then he, understanding their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me the coin that I may see it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother dies and leaves [his] wife [behind him] and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Then Jesus, answering, said unto them, Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they shall rise from the dead, neither shall they marry nor husbands take women nor women, husbands; but are as the angels who are in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And regarding the dead who are to rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him, saying, I Am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scribes came, having heard their dispute and knowing that he had given a good response unto them, asked him, Which is the principal commandment of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>And Jesus responded unto him, The principal of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God, the Lord is one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy thought and with all thy strength: this [is] the principal commandment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>Then the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth, that God is one, and there is none other outside of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love [his] neighbour as himself is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Then Jesus, seeing that he responded wisely, said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him [any question].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And answering, Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by [the] Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And with Jesus sitting in front of the ark of the offering, he beheld how the people cast money into the ark and many that were rich cast in much.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>Then calling his disciples, he said unto them, Verily I say unto you that this poor widow has cast more in than all those who have cast into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>for [they] all did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said unto him, I AM, and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power [of God] and coming in the clouds of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What need have we any more for witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him, Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there came one of the maids of the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and when she saw Peter warming himself, looking upon him, said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know [him] not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the maid seeing him again began to say to those that stood by, This is [one] of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he denied it again. And a little after, those that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them, for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agrees [unto it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>And he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I do not know this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the words that Jesus had said unto him, Before the cock crows twice, thou shalt deny me three times. And thinking on this, he wept.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And straightway in the morning the princes of the priests having held a consultation with the elders and with the scribes and with the whole council, took Jesus away bound and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he, answering, said unto him, Thou sayest [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the princes of the priests accused him of many [things].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus yet answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at [that] feast [it was customary that] he release unto them one prisoner, whoever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was [one] named Barabbas, [who lay] bound with those that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had always done unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the princes of the priests had delivered him for envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the princes of the priests moved the multitude that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his [head]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they smote him on the head with a reed and spit upon him and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him unto the place of Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, but he received [it] not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucified two thieves: the one on his right hand and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou that would destroy the temple of God and build [it] in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save thyself and come down from the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise also the princes of the priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, King of Israel, descend now from the stake that we may see and believe. And those that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of those that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put [it] on a reed and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But Jesus, giving a great cry, expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>Then the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw that he so cried out and expired, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also [some] women looking on afar off, among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the lesser and of Joses, and Salome</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>(who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered unto him), and many other women who came up with him unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now when the evening was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, a noble senator, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate marvelled that he was already dead; and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath [of the great feast of the passover] was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary [the] mother of James, and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting to the right hand [side], covered in a long white garment; and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said unto them, Do not be frightened; Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified; he is risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him as he said unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre, for they trembled and were amazed; neither said they any thing to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now as [Jesus] rose early the first of the sabbaths, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>[And] she went and told those that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And they, when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked and went into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told [it] unto the others, yet they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Finally he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at the table and upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow those that believe: In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall take away serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with the signs which followed them. [Amen].:</verse>
