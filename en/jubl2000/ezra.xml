      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and [put it] also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The LORD God of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Who [is there] among you of all his people? Let God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel (he [is] God), which [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whoever may remain of all the places where they remained a stranger, let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts, with freewill gifts for the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then rose up the heads of the families of Judah and of Benjamin and the priests and the Levites, of all those whose spirit God woke up to go up to build the house of the LORD which [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all those that [were] about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver and of gold, with goods and with beasts and with precious things, besides all [that] was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus, the king, brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Even those did Cyrus, king of Persia, bring forth by the hand of Mithredath, the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this [is] the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, twenty-nine knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>thirty basins of gold, silver basons of a second [sort] four hundred and ten, [and] another thousand vessels.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month was come and the sons of Israel [were] in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as [it is] written in the law of Moses, the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its bases, for fear [was] upon them because of the peoples of those lands, and they offered burnt offerings upon it unto the LORD, [even] burnt offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>They kept also the feast of the tabernacles, as [it is] written, and [offered] the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, each thing in its day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>and in addition to this, the continual burnt offering and the new moons and all the sanctified feasts of the LORD and every spontaneous freewill [offering] unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not [yet] laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>And they gave money unto the masons and to the carpenters; and food and drink and oil unto the Zidonians and to those of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the will of Cyrus, king of Persia, over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>And in the second year of their coming unto the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren, the priests and the Levites, and all those that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then Jeshua stood [with] his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, [with] their sons and their brethren, the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the ordinance of David, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang, praising and giving thanks unto the LORD because [he is] good, for his mercy [endures] for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, praising the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and of the heads of the fathers, [who were] ancient men that had seen the first house, as the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice while many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity built the temple unto the LORD God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the fathers and said unto them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as ye [do]; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assur, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we alone will build unto the LORD God of Israel as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their counsel, all the days of Cyrus, king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote accusations against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes, king of Persia; and the writing of the letter [was] written in the Syrian tongue and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes, the king, in this sort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then [wrote] Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, [and] the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar ([Sennacherib]) brought over and set in the cities of Samaria and the rest [that are] on the other side of the river, and of Cheenet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This [is] the copy of the letter that they sent: Unto Artaxerxes, the king: Thy servants, the men of the other side of the river, and of Cheenet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known unto the king that the Jews who came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have founded the walls [thereof] and joined the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city is rebuilt, and the walls founded, they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so the revenue of the kings shall be reduced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we are salted with the salt of the palace, and it is not just unto us to see the king's dishonour; therefore, we have sent to make this known unto the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>that search may be made in the book of the records of our fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city [is] a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that from old time they form rebellions in the midst of her, for which cause this city was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We notify the king that if this city is built [again], and its walls founded, the portion on the other side of the river shall no longer be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The king sent this answer unto Rehum, the chancellor, and [to] Shimshai, the scribe, and [to] the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria and to the rest of those of the other side of the river and to Cheenet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which you sent unto us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings and [that] rebellion and sedition have been made in her</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>and that there have been mighty kings in Jerusalem, who have ruled over all [that is] beyond the river, and that toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city not be built until [another] commandment shall be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Take heed now that ye not fail to do this; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter [was] read before Rehum, and Shimshai, the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them to cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then the work of the house of God which [was] at Jerusalem ceased. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then the prophets, Haggai, the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that [were] in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the house of God which [was] at Jerusalem; and with them [were] the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time Tatnai, captain of this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions came to them and said thus unto them, Who has commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then we said unto them regarding this, These are the names of the men that make this building!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>For the eyes of their God were upon the elders of the Jews, and they could not cause them to cease until the matter came to Darius, and then they returned answer by letter concerning this [matter].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, captain of this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions, the Apharsachites, which [were] on this side the river, sent unto Darius, the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>they sent a letter unto him, in which was written thus; Unto Darius, the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is being built with stones of marble, and the timbers are laid in the walls, and this work is going fast and prospers in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked the elders [and] said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house and to found these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked their names also, to notify thee, that we might write the names of the men that [were at] the head of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are servants of the God of heaven and earth and rebuild the house that was built many years ago, which the great king of Israel built and founded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after our fathers raged against the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon [the same] King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that [was] in Jerusalem and had brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus, the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto Sheshbazzar, whom he had made captain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>and said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that [is] in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then the same Sheshbazzar came [and] laid the foundation of the house of God which [was] in Jerusalem, and since that time until now it is being built, and it is not yet finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Now, therefore, if [it seems] good to the king, let there be a search made in the king's treasure house, which [is] there in Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus, the king, to build this house of God in Jerusalem, and let the king send unto us his will concerning this matter.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius, the king, gave a commandment, and a search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.2'>And there was found in the coffer of the palace that [is] in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein [was] a record thus written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus, the king, [the same] Cyrus, the king, gave a commandment [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem, that the house be built as a place for sacrifices to be offered, and let the walls thereof be covered; the height thereof sixty cubits, [and] the breadth thereof sixty cubits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>the orders, three of stones of marble and one order of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which [was] at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon, be restored and go again unto the temple which [is] at Jerusalem, to his place, and let them be placed in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.6'>Now [therefore], Tatnai, captain of the other side of the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions, the Apharsachites, who [are] on the other side of the river, remove yourselves from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.7'>Leave the work of this house of God unto the captain of the Jews and to their elders that they may build this house of God in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.8'>And by me is given the commandment regarding what ye shall do with the elders of these Jews, to build this house of God: that of the king's goods, of the tribute from the other side of the river, the expenses be given unto these men, that they not cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.9'>And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests which [are] at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day that they not cease:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.10'>that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.11'>It is also given by my commandment that whoever shall alter this word, let a timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it, and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.12'>And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter [or] to destroy this house of God which [is] at Jerusalem. I Darius have made the decree; let it be done with speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.13'>Then Tatnai, captain of the other side of the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, speedily did according to that which Darius, the king, had sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.14'>And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered according to the prophesy of Haggai, the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They built and finished [it], according to the commandment of the God of Israel and according to the commandment of Cyrus and of Darius and of Artaxerxes, king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.15'>And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.16'>And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the sons of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.18'>And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses over the work of God, which [is] at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.19'>And the sons of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them [were] pure, and killed the passover for all the sons of the captivity and for their brethren, the priests, and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>And the sons of Israel who had returned out of captivity and all those who had separated themselves unto them from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.22'>and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.:</verse>
