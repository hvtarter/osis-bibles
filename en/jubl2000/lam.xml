      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>[Aleph] How does the city sit solitary, [that was] full of people! The great one among the nations is become as a widow; the princess of provinces is become tributary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>[Beth] She weeps sore in the night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has none to comfort [her]; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>[Gimel] Judah is gone into captivity because of the affliction and because of the greatness of the servitude; she dwells among the Gentiles; she finds no rest; all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>[Daleth] The streets of Zion mourn because there are none to come to the solemnities; all her gates [are] destroyed; her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>[He] Her enemies have been made the head; those who hated her have been prospered; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her rebellions; her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>[Vau] And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed; her princes are become like harts [that] find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>[Zain] Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and of her rebellions and of all her desirable things that she had in the times of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and no one helped her; the enemies saw her [and] mocked at her days of rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>[Cheth] Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is removed; all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; yea, she sighs and is turned backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>[Teth] Her filthiness [is] in her skirts; she did not remember her latter end; therefore she came down surprisingly; she has no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction, for the enemy has magnified [himself].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>[Jod] The enemy has spread out his hand upon all her precious things, and [she] saw the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command [that] they should not enter into thy congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>[Caph] All her people sought their bread with sadness; they have given all their precious things for food to maintain life; see, O LORD, and consider, for I am [become] vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>[Lamed] [Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is come unto me because the LORD has afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>[Mem] From upon high he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them; he has spread a net for my feet; he has turned me back; he has made me desolate [and] always with pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>[Nun] The yoke of my rebellions is bound in his hand; they are wreathed [and] come up upon my neck; he has made my strength to fall; the Lord has delivered me into [their] hands, [from whom] I am not able to rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>[Samech] The Lord has trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me; he has called a company against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah [as] in a winepress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>[Ain] For these [things] I weep; my eyes, my eyes stream with water because the comforter that gives rest unto my soul has left me; my sons are desolate because the enemy prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>[Pe] Zion spread forth her hands and has no comforter; the LORD gave a commandment against Jacob that his enemies [should] besiege him; Jerusalem was an abomination in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>[Tzaddi] The LORD is righteous, for I have rebelled against his mouth; hear now, all the peoples and see my sorrow; my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>[Koph] I called unto my lovers, [but] they have deceived me; my priests and my elders in the city perished seeking food to maintain their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>[Resh] Look, O LORD; for I [am] in distress; my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled; abroad the sword bereaves; at home [there is] as death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>[Schin] They have heard that I sigh; and there is no comforter for me; all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done [it]. Thou hast brought the day [that] thou hast spoken of, but they shall be like unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>[Tau] Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my rebellions; for my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] filled with pain.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>[Aleph] How has the Lord darkened the daughter of Zion in his anger! He has cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel and not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>[Beth] The Lord has destroyed and has not forgiven; he has destroyed in his wrath all the habitations of Jacob; he has thrown down to the ground the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has polluted the kingdom and its princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>[Gimel] He has cut off in [his] fierce anger all the horn of Israel; he has caused his right hand to draw back in the presence of the enemy, and he burned in Jacob like a flaming fire, [which] devours round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>[Daleth] He has bent his bow like an enemy; he strengthened his right hand as an adversary and slew everything of beauty that could be seen in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>[He] The Lord was as an enemy, he has destroyed Israel; he has destroyed all her palaces; he has dissipated his strong holds and has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>[Vau] And he has violently taken away his tabernacle as [if it were of] a garden; he has destroyed his congregation; the LORD has caused the solemnities and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion and has rejected in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>[Zain] The Lord has cast off his altar; he has abhorred his sanctuary; he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have shouted in the house of the LORD as in the day of a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>[Cheth] The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; he has stretched out the line; he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying; therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they were destroyed together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>[Teth] Her gates were thrown to the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars; her king and her princes [are carried off] among the Gentiles; there is no law; nor have her prophets found vision from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>[Jod] The elders of the daughter of Zion sat upon the ground [and] are silent: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the daughters of Jerusalem hung their heads down to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>[Caph] My eyes fail with tears; my bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings faint in the streets of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>[Lamed] They said to their mothers, Where [is] the wheat and the wine? fainting as the dead in the streets of the city, pouring out their souls into their mothers' bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>[Mem] What witness shall I take to thee? Or unto whom shall I liken thee O daughter of Jerusalem? Unto whom shall I compare thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach [is] as great as the sea: who shall heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>[Nun] Thy prophets have preached vanity and foolishness unto thee; and they have not uncovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have preached unto thee vain prophecies and digressions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>[Samech] All that passed by clapped [their] hands over thee and whistled and wagged their heads over the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying], [Is] this the city that [men] called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>[Pe] All thine enemies opened their mouth regarding thee; they whistled and gnashed their teeth; they said, Swallow [her] up; certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found it, we have seen [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>[Ain] The LORD has done [that] which he had determined; he has fulfilled his word that he had commanded from [the] time of old; he has destroyed and has not forgiven; and he has caused [thine] enemy to rejoice over thee; he has raised up the horn of thine adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>[Tsade] Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion; let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>[Koph] Arise, cry out in the night; in the beginning of the watches; pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord; lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>[Resh] Look, O LORD, and consider unto whom thou hast shaken thus. Shall the women eat their fruit, the little ones that they are bringing up? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>[Schin] The young and the old lay on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men fell by the sword; thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed [and] hast not forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>[Tau] Thou hast called as to a day of solemnity my terrors from everywhere, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger no one escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up my enemy has consumed.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>[Aleph] I [am] a man [that] sees affliction in the rod of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>[Aleph] He has led me and brought [me into] darkness, but not [into] light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>[Aleph] Surely he is turned against me; he turns his hand [against me] all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>[Beth] My flesh and my skin he has made old; he has broken my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>[Beth] He has built against me and compassed [me] with gall and travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>[Beth] He has set me in dark places as [those that are] dead for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>[Gimel] He has hedged me about that I cannot get out; he has made my chain heavy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>[Daleth] He [was] unto me [as] a bear lying in wait [and as] a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>[Daleth] He has made my ways crooked and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>[Daleth] He has bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>[He] He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>[He] I was a derision to all my people [and] their song every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>[He] He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunk with wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>[Vau] He has broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>[Vau] My soul removed itself far from peace; I forgot about good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>[Vau] And I said, My strength and my hope of the LORD is perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>[Zain] Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>[Zain] My soul shall have [them] still in remembrance because it is humbled in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.4.20'>[Resh] The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.21'>[Schin] Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup shall also pass even unto thee; thou shalt be drunken and shalt vomit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.22'>[Tau] The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will never cause thee to be carried away again; he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.:</verse>
