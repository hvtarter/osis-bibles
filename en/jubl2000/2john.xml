        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder unto the chosen lady and her sons, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those that have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth's sake, which abides in us and shall be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy [and] peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I have rejoiced greatly, for I have found of thy sons that they walk in the truth, as we have received the commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, (not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning) that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is charity, that we walk after his commandment. And this is the commandment, That ye walk in him, as ye have heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh. This same is a deceiver and antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we not lose those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a fulfilled reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoever rebels and does not abide in the doctrine of the Christ, does not have God. He that abides in the doctrine of the Christ, the same has the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes unto you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into [your] house neither say unto him, Welcome:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that says unto him, Welcome, is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink, but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The sons of thy chosen sister greet thee. Amen.:</verse>
