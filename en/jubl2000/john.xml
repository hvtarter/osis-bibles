        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah).

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>[That Word] was the true Light, which lightens every man that comes into this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who are not born of blood, nor of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And of his fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses, [but] the grace and the truth [of God] came through Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And those who were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said unto him, Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there stands one among you, whom ye know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John gave testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and have given testimony that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>And again the next day John stood, and two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John [speak] and followed him was Andrew, brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee and found Philip and said unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, Behold a true Israelite, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said unto him, From where dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus and his disciples were also called to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And being short of wine, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he said unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the butler. And they bore [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the butler had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not where it was [from] (but the servants who drew the water knew), the butler called the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said unto him, Every man at the beginning sets forth the good wine, and when they are well satisfied, then that which is worse; [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples, and they continued there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overthrew the tables</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and said unto those that sold the doves, Take these things away from here; do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>Then his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house has consumed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said unto them, Dissolve this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then said the Jews, This temple was forty-six years in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>Therefore when he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, seeing the signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them because he knew all [men]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and needed not that any man should give testimony, for he knew what was in man.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a prince of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that thou doest unless God is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a person be born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Unless a man is born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it desires, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell from where it comes or where it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can this be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee that we speak what we know and testify that which we have seen, and ye do not receive our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and ye do not believe, how shall ye believe if I tell you [of] heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has ascended up to the heaven but he that came down from the heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea, and he tarried there with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a question between the disciples of John and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came unto John and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan of whom thou gave witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all [men] come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing except it is given him from the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice; this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>It is expedient [unto] him to increase, but [unto] me, to decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that comes from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks earthly things: he that comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit by measure [unto him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believes in the Son has eternal life, and he that does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judaea and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And it was necessary that he go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Then he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well; [and] it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water; Jesus said unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then said the Samaritan woman unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from where then hast thou that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof himself, and his sons and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said unto him, Lord, give me this water, that I not thirst, neither come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said unto her, Go, call thy husband and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said with truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said unto him, Lord, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship what ye know not; we worship what we know, for saving health is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a Spirit and those that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said unto him, I know that [the] Messiah is to come, who is called the Christ; when he is come, he will declare [unto] us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said unto her, I AM that speak unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with [that] woman; yet no one said, What askest thou? or, What talkest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to those men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who told me all that I have done; is perchance this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>Then they went out of the city and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meanwhile his disciples entreated him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said unto them, I have a food to eat that ye know not of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore the said disciples one to another, Has anyone brought him [anything] to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>[Do] ye not say, There are yet four months and [then] comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>And herein is that saying true, One sows and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I have sent you to reap that upon which ye bestowed no labour; others laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him by the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they asked him to abide with them; and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed by his own word</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speech; for we have heard [him] ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after two days he departed from that place and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had also gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then Jesus said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman said unto him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said unto him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke unto him, and he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told [him], saying, Thy son lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son lives; and he believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This again [is] the second sign [that] Jesus did when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep [gate], which in Hebrew is called, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water; whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying [there] and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he said unto him, Dost thou desire to be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked, and on that day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he that was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him: because he had done these things on a sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father do; for all that he does, this also the Son does together with [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all the things that he does, and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises up the dead and gives [them] life; even so the Son gives life unto whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the Son</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that everyone should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has also given him power [and authority] to execute judgment because he is Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this, for an hour shall come when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and those that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but those that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of my own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that bears witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye sent unto John, and he bore witness unto the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man, but I say these things that ye might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing to rejoice for one hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater testimony than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And ye do not have his word abiding in you; for whom he has sent, him ye do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are those who testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I [do] not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can ye believe, who take glory one from another, and seek not the glory that [comes] only from God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is [one] that accuses you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him because they saw his signs which he did in the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up [his] eyes and saw a great company come unto him; he said unto Philip, From where shall we buy bread that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But he said this to prove him, for he knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Two hundred denarius of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one of them may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves and two small fishes, but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Then Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to those that were sitting down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered [them] together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over from those that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, as they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth the prophet that was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Jesus therefore knowing that they would come and take him by force to make him king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening was come, his disciples went down unto the sea</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and entered into a ship and were crossing the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said unto them, I AM; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day following when the multitude which was on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one in which his disciples had entered and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(but other boats came from Tiberias near unto the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks);</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when didst thou come here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye have seen the signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Labour not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you, for him has God the Father sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is he who descended from heaven and gives life unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then said they unto him, Lord, always give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said unto them, I AM the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I came down from the heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the Father's will who has sent me, that of all whom he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall have no life in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard [this] said, This is a hard word; who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said unto them, Does this offend you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>The Spirit is he that gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken unto you, [they] are Spirit and [they] are life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spoke of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon, for it was he that should betray him, being one of the twelve.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we do not stone thee, but for blasphemy; and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized, and there he abode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came unto him and said, John certainly did no sign, but all [the] things that John spoke of this man were true.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was [that] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after that he said to [his] disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>[His] disciples said unto him, Rabbi, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and goest thou there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But he who walks in the night stumbles because there is no light in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Having said that he said unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then his disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus had spoken of his death, and they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said unto them plainly, Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary sat [still] in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it unto] thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said unto her, I AM the resurrection and the life; he that believes in me, though he is dead, yet shall he live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said unto him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were with her in the house and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he became enraged in [the] Spirit and stirred himself up</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then the Jews said, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Could not this [man], who opened the eyes of the blind, have also caused that this [man] should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore, becoming enraged again in himself, came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that had died, said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks, for he has been [dead] four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said unto her, Did I not say unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shalt see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus, lifting up [his] eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the people who stand by I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>Then he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went unto the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the high priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, What shall we do? for this man does many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, everyone will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, [named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this he spoke not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but that he should also gather together in one the sons of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So that from that day forth they took counsel together to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called Ephraim and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the passover of the Jews was now at hand, and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>and they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the high priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that if anyone knew where he was he should show [it], that they might take him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those that sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], who should betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarius and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag and would take [from] what was put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Therefore Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day of my burying she has kept this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>for the poor ye always have with you, but ye shall not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there; and they came not only for Jesus' sake, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the princes of the priests took counsel that they might also put Lazarus to death</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day the multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he that comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat upon it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold, thy King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him and [that] they had done these things unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude, therefore, that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead, bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause the multitude also met him, for they had heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>the same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we desire to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour comes in which the Son of man shall be clarified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves me, let them follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; the one that serves me, will my Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour, but for this have I come in this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, clarify thy name. Then there came a voice from the heaven, [saying], I have clarified it and will clarify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The people, therefore, that were present and heard [it], said that it thundered; others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou, It is expedient that the Son of man be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the Light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light that ye may be the sons of light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But although he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who shall believe our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with [their] eyes nor understand with [their] heart and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, even among the princes many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried and said, He that believes in me, believes not in me, but in him that sent me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and he that sees me sees him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come [as] a light into the world that whosoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I AM king. To this end I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and said unto them, I find no fault [at all] in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put [it] on his head, and they put a purple robe on him</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And [Pilate] said unto them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the princes of the priests and the servants saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Take him, and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he was the more afraid</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and went again into the judgement hall and said unto Jesus, Where art thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to hang thee on a stake and have power to release thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, Thou could have no power [at all] against me, unless it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee has the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>And from then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend; whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgement seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour; then he said unto the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The high priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>So that then, he delivered him unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led [him] away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he, bearing his stake, went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a title and put [it] above the stake. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>And many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew [and] Greek [and] Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews, but that he said, I AM King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts (to each soldier a part); and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my raiment they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the stake of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar, and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put [it] upon hyssop and put [it] to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and he bowed his head and gave the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the stake on the sabbath day (for that sabbath day was a high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and [that] they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who were crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw [it] gives testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he says [the] truth, that ye also might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Then Nicodemus came also, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>And they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>Therefore they laid Jesus there because of the Jews' preparation [day], for the sepulchre was near.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first of the sabbaths, Mary Magdalene came early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre and saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And he, stooping down [and looking in], saw the linen clothes lying; yet he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then came Simon Peter following him and went into the sepulchre and saw the linen clothes lying</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin, that had been [placed] over his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then that other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in also and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again unto their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside [near] the sepulchre weeping, and as she wept, she stooped down [and looked] into the sepulchre</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and saw two angels in white sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said unto her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She said unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing [there] and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said unto her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said unto him, Lord, if thou didst carry him off, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said unto her, Mary! Turning herself around, she said unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said unto her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came giving the news to the disciples, That I have seen the Lord, and he spoke these things unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, he showed them [his] hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then Jesus said to them again, Peace [be] unto you; as [my] Father has sent me, even so send I you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on [them] and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>unto those whose sins ye release, they shall be released; [and] unto those whose [sins] ye retain, they shall be retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples, therefore, said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And again eight days later, his disciples were within and Thomas with them; [then] Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, Reach here thy finger and behold my hands and reach here thy hand and thrust [it] into my side and be not unbelieving, but faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed [are] those that have not seen and [yet] have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And Jesus truly did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and he manifested himself in this manner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the [sons] of Zebedee and two other of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said unto them, I am going fishing. They said unto him, Let us also go with thee. They went forth and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have ye any food? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right hand side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's coat [unto him] (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in the [little] ship (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits), dragging the net with [the] fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three; and being so many, yet the net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave them, and the fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This [was] now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yes, Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and carry [thee] where thou wouldest not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should clarify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry until I come, what [is that] to thee? follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then this saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus did not say unto him, He shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry until I come, what [is that] to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I think that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.:</verse>
