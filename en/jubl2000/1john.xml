        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah).

      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>(for the life is manifested, and we also saw [it] and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and appeared unto us);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us; and truly our communion [is] with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>This then is the promise which we have heard of him and declare unto you, That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with him in the midst of us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I write these things unto you, that ye sin not; and if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate before the Father, Jesus, the righteous Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>and he is the reconciliation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And in this we do know that we have known him if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He that says, I have known him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whosoever keeps his word, in him verily is the charity of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which is the truth in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He that says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he that hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and does not know where he goes, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write unto you, little children, that your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write unto you, fathers, that ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, that ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, that ye have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written unto you, fathers, that ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, that ye are strong and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not the world neither the things [that are] in the world. If anyone loves the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world passes away and the lust thereof, but he that does the will of God abides for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last hour, and as ye have heard that the antichrist shall come, likewise there are also beginning to be many antichrists, by which we know that it is the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us; but [this happened] that it might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But ye have the anointing of the Holy One, and ye know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written unto you as if ye ignore the truth, but as unto those that know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This same is antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Whosoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. Whosoever confesses the Son, has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. For if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also shall [continue to] abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise that he has promised us, [even] eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These [things] I have written unto you concerning those that seduce you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it has taught you, abide ye in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If ye know that he is righteous, also know that any one that does righteousness is born of him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold, what charity the Father has given us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world does not know us, because it does not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be; but we know that if he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And ye know that he appeared to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whosoever abides in him does not sin: whosoever sins has not seen him or known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one deceive you; he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he also is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might undo the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this the sons of God are manifest, and the sons of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness and that loves not his brother is not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, That we should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>Not as Cain, [who] was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we are passed from death unto life, in that we love the brethren. He that does not love [his] brother abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>In this we have known the charity [of God] because he laid down his life for us; we also ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whosoever has this world's goods and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how does the charity of God abide in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My little children, let us not love in word neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And in this we know that we are of the truth and have our hearts certified before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>And if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, [then] we have confidence in God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>In this know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ, is come in flesh is of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ, is come in flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, of which ye have heard that it should come, and that now it is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world; therefore, they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God; he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. Anyone that loves is born of God and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He that does not love does not know God, for God is charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>In this was the charity of God demonstrated in us, in that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this does the charity consist, not because we had loved God, but because he loved us and has sent his Son [to be] the reconciliation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his charity is completed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, in that he has given us of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And we have known and believed the charity that God has in us. God is charity, and he that abides in charity abides in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>In this the charity with us is made perfect, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, that as he is, so are we in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>In charity there is no fear; but charity that is perfect casts out fear; because fear has torment; from which he that fears is not complete in charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love him, because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And we have this commandment from him, That he who loves God loves his brother also.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and anyone that loves him that begat also loves him that is born of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>In this we know that we love the sons of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, [even] our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is Jesus, the Christ, who came by water and blood; not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is he that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He that believes in the Son of God has the witness of God in himself; he that does not believe God has made God a liar; because he does not believe the witness that God has testified of his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the witness that God has given eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He that has the Son has life; [and] he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the confidence that we have in God, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have the petitions that we asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he shall ask [God], and he shall give him life [that is], unto those that do not sin unto death. There is sin unto death, for which I do not say that you should pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin, but there is a sin not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>[And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>But we know that the Son of God is come and has given us understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.:</verse>
