        <verse osisID='Obad.1.1'>The vision of Obadiah. Thus hath the Lord GOD said concerning Edom: We have heard the message from the LORD, and [a] messenger is sent to the Gentiles, Arise, and let us rise up against her in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.2'>Behold, I have made thee small among the Gentiles: thou [shalt be] greatly humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.3'>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation [is] high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.4'>Though thou exalt [thyself] as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars, from there I will bring thee down, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.5'>Did thieves come to thee, or robbers by night? (how art thou destroyed!) would they not have stolen until they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave [some] grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.6'>How were [the things] of Esau searched out! His hidden things were sought after!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.7'>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee [even] to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee [and] prevailed against thee; [those that eat] thy bread have laid a wound under thee; [there is] no intelligence in this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.8'>Shall I not in that day, said the LORD, even destroy the wise [men] out of Edom and intelligence out of the mount of Esau?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.9'>And thy mighty [men], O Teman, shall be dismayed because every man shall be cut off from mount of Esau by the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.10'>For [thy] violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.11'>In the day that thou didst stand on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou [wast] as one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>But thou should not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should thou have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day they were lost; neither should thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>Thou should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; thou should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.14'>neither should thou have stood in the crossway, to kill those of his that did escape; neither should thou have delivered up those of his that remained in the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.15'>For the day of the LORD [is] near upon all [the] Gentiles: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.16'>For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the Gentiles drink continually; they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.17'>But in mount Zion shall be deliverance, and it shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.18'>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them and devour them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.19'>And [those of] the south shall possess the mount of Esau and the plains of the Palestinians, and they shall also possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria; and Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.20'>And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel [shall possess] that of the Canaanites, [even] unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who [shall be] in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.21'>And saviours shall come up unto mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.:</verse>
