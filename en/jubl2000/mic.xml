      <chapter osisID='Mic.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.2'>Hear, all ye peoples; hearken, O earth, and all that is therein: and the Lord GOD, the Lord from his holy temple shall be [a] witness against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.3'>For, behold, the LORD comes forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.4'>And the mountains shall melt under him, and the valleys shall be split, as wax before the fire, [and] as the waters [that] run down a steep place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.5'>All this for the rebellion of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the rebellion of Jacob? [is it] not Samaria? and what [are] the high places of Judah? [are they] not Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.6'>Therefore I will make Samaria into heaps in the field, into a land of vineyards: and I will scatter her stones throughout the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.7'>And all her graven images shall be broken to pieces, and all her gifts shall be burned in the fire, and I will destroy all her idols, for she gathered [it] of the gifts of harlots, and they shall return unto gifts of harlots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.8'>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.9'>For her wound [is] painful, for it is come unto Judah; it is come unto the gate of my people, [even] to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.10'>Do not declare [it] in Gath, weep little; roll thyself in the dust for the house of Aphrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.11'>Pass away naked with shame, thou inhabitant of Saphir: the inhabitant of Zaanan did not come forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you for his lateness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.12'>For the inhabitant of Maroth was pained because of good; therefore evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.13'>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, hitch the chariot to dromedaries: for thou [wert] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion, for in thee the rebellions of Israel were invented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.14'>Therefore shalt thou give gifts to Moreshethgath; the houses of Achzib [shall be] a lie to the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.15'>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come unto Adullam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.16'>Make thee bald, and shave thee for the sons of thy delight; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, for they are gone into captivity from thee.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.1'>Woe unto those that devise iniquity and fabricate evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they put it into effect because they have power in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.2'>And they coveted fields and stole them, and houses and took [them] away; so they oppressed the man and his house, even the man and his heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.3'>Therefore thus hath the LORD said; Behold, I devise an evil against this family, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye walk haughtily; for the time shall be evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.4'>In that time shall [one] take up a saying against you and lament with a doleful lamentation [and] say, We have been utterly destroyed; he has changed the portion of my people; how has he taken our fields! He has given and [divided our fields unto others].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.5'>Therefore thou shalt have no one to cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.6'>Do not prophesy, [they say to] those that prophesy: Do not prophesy unto them [that] they are to understand shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.7'>O [thou that] calls thyself the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD shortened? [are] these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.8'>He who yesterday [was] my people is risen up as an enemy; ye pull off the robe with the garment from those that pass by as those who return from war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.9'>Ye have cast the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; from their children ye have taken away my continual praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.10'>Arise and depart, for this [is] not [your] rest because it is polluted; it has become corrupted and with a great corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.11'>If there is one walking in the spirit of falsehood, he shall lie, [saying], I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.12'>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah as [the] flock in the midst of their fold; they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.13'>[The] breaker shall go up before them; they shall break through and pass through the gate and go out by it; and their king shall pass before them, the LORD at the head of them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.1'>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O princes of Jacob, and ye heads of the house of Israel. [Did] it not [pertain] to you to know that which is right?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.2'>Who hate the good, and love the evil, who steal their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.3'>and eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.4'>Then they shall cry unto the LORD, but he will not respond to them: he will even hide his face from them at that time because of their evil doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.5'>Thus hath the LORD said concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that does not give them [something] to eat, they even prepare war against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.6'>Therefore the vision shall be made night unto you, and darkness unto those that divine, and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.7'>Then the prophets shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; and they shall all cover their lips because [they shall have] no answer from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.8'>But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his rebellion, and to Israel his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.9'>Now hear this, ye heads of the house of Jacob and captains of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment and pervert all equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.10'>that build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.11'>the heads thereof judge for bribes, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they come near unto the LORD, and say, [Is] not the LORD among us? No evil can come upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.12'>Therefore for your sake Zion shall be plowed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.1'>But it shall come to pass in the last of the times [that] the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the top of the mountains and higher than all the hills, and peoples shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.2'>And many Gentiles shall come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth from Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.3'>And he shall judge among many peoples and correct strong nations even afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they train for war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.4'>But each one shall sit under their vine and under their fig tree, and no one shall make [them] afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of the hosts has spoken [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.5'>Even if all the peoples should walk each one in the name of their gods; with all this we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and eternally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.6'>In that day, saith the LORD, I will assemble her that is lame, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.7'>and I will make her that is lame to be heirs, and her that was cast off a strong nation, and the LORD shall reign over them in the mount of Zion from now, and for evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.8'>And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion shall come unto thee; and the dominion shall come first, the kingdom, to the daughter of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.9'>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? [is there] no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.10'>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now thou shalt go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go [even] to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.11'>But now many nations are gathered against thee that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes see our desire [carried out] upon Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.12'>But they did not know the thoughts of the LORD, neither did they understand his counsel by which he gathered them as sheaves onto the [threshing] floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.13'>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs bronze; and thou shalt break in pieces many peoples; and thou shalt consecrate their spoil unto the LORD and their riches unto the Lord of the whole earth.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.1'>Now thou shalt be besieged by armies, O daughter of [the] army: he shall lay siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.2'>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, [though] thou be little among the thousands of Judah, [yet] out of thee shall he come forth unto me [that is] to be Lord in Israel; and his goings forth [are] from the beginning, from the days of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.3'>Therefore he will give them up until the time [that] she who travails has brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.4'>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide; for now he shall be great unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.5'>And he shall be [our] peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then we shall raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.6'>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the blade, and the land of Nimrod with their swords; and he shall deliver [us] from the Assyrian when he comes against our land and when he treads [within] our borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.7'>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as the dew of the LORD, as the rains upon the grass, which did not expect [a] man, nor did they expect the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.8'>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goes through and treads down and tears in pieces, there are none that can escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.9'>Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine enemies, and all thine adversaries shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.10'>And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD, that I will cause thy horses to be killed out of the midst of thee, and I will cause thy chariots to be destroyed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.11'>and I will cause all the cities of thy land to be destroyed, and I will cause all thy fortresses to be destroyed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.12'>and I will cause the witchcrafts to be destroyed by thy hand; and no [more] soothsayers shall be found in thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.13'>and I will cause thy graven images and thy images to be destroyed out of the midst of thee; and never again shalt thou worship the work of thine hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.14'>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.5.15'>And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury in the Gentiles who have not heard.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.1'>Hear ye now what the LORD saith: Arise, contend thou with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.2'>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will reprove Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.3'>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and in what have I wearied thee? testify against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.4'>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and ransomed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.5'>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal: that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.6'>With what shall I present myself before the LORD, [and how] shall I worship the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.7'>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn [for] my rebellion, the fruit of my bowels [for] the sin of my soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.8'>He has declared unto thee, O man, what [is] good and what the LORD requires of thee: only to do [right] judgment, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself to walk with thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.9'>The LORD'S voice cries [out] unto the city, and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and [he] who has established it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.10'>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure [that is] abominable?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.11'>Can I be pure with false balances and with a bag of deceitful weights?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.12'>With which their rich men are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue [is] deceitful in their mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.13'>Therefore I have also made [thee] weak in smiting thee, in making [thee] desolate because of thy sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.14'>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down [shall be] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take, but shalt not be saved; and [that] which thou dost save, I will give it up to the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.15'>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.6.16'>For the statutes of Omri have been kept and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye have walked in their counsels that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.1'>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer [fruits], as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.2'>The merciful [man] of the earth is missing: and [there is] no one upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt each man his brother with a net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.3'>To complete the evil with their hands, the prince demands, and the judge [judges] for a reward; and the great [man] speaks the desires of his heart: and they confirm it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.4'>The best of them [is] as a brier; the most upright [as] a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, thy visitation, comes; now shall be their confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.5'>Do not believe in a friend, do not trust in a prince; from her that lies at thy side, take care, open not thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.6'>For the son dishonours the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; and a man's enemies [are] those of his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.7'>Therefore I will wait for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my saving health; my God will hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.8'>Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy; for if I have fallen, I shall arise; if I sit in darkness, the LORD [is] my light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.9'>I will bear the indignation of the LORD because I have sinned against him, until he has judged my cause and executed my judgment; he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.10'>Then [she that is] my enemy shall see [it], and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? my eyes shall behold her: now she shall be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.11'>In the day that thy walls shall be built unto thee, [in] that day shall the decree [of thy slavery] be far removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.12'>[In] that day [also] he shall come even to thee from Assyria and [from] the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.13'>And the land with those that dwell therein shall be made desolate, for the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.14'>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell only [in] the mountain, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed [in] Bashan and Gilead, as in the time of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.15'>I will show you marvellous [things] as in the day when thou came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.16'>The Gentiles shall see and be ashamed at all thy mighty acts: they shall lay [their] hand upon [their] mouth, their ears shall become deaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.17'>They shall lick the dust like a serpent; as the serpents of the earth, they shall tremble in their holes; they shall be filled with fear of the LORD our God and shall [also] fear thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.18'>Who [is] a God like unto thee that pardons iniquity, and passes over the rebellion with the remnant of his heritage? He did not retain his anger for ever because he delights [in] mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.19'>He will turn again, he will have mercy on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.7.20'>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob [and] the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the times of old.:</verse>
