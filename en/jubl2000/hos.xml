  <div type='book' osisID='Hos'>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the word of the LORD with Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land shall give itself over to whoredom [by] departing from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little [while], and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And [God] said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will never again have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah and will save them in the LORD their God and will not save them by bow, by sword, by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>And after she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>Then said [God], Call his name Loammi: for ye [are] not my people, and I will not be your [God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>With all [this], the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people, [there] it shall be said unto them, [Ye are] the sons of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be congregated together, and they shall raise up for themselves one head, and they shall rise up from the land: for the day of Jezreel [is] great.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your mother, contend: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore remove her whoredoms from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>lest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>Neither will I have mercy upon her sons, for they [are] the sons of whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother has played the harlot; she that conceived them has been shamed; for she said, I will go after my lovers that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them]; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then [it was] better with me than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not recognize that I gave her the wheat and the wine and the oil and multiplied unto them the silver and the gold, [with which] they made Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore I will return and take away my wheat in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax that [I]had given to cover her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now [I] will uncover her folly in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast, her new moon, and her sabbath, and all her festivities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will cause her vine and her fig tree to be cut down, of which she has said, These [are] my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will reduce them to a thicket, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit upon her the times of the Baals, unto whom she burned incense, and she adorned herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, oblivious of me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will induce her and bring her into the wilderness and speak unto her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be in that time, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me My Husband, and shalt no longer call me Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no longer be remembered by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that time I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heaven and [with] the serpents of the earth; and I will break [the] bow and [the] sword and [the] battle of the earth and will cause them to sleep safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth thee unto me in faith: and thou shalt know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth shall respond to the wheat and the wine and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon Loruhamah, and I will say to Loammi, Thou [art] my people; and he shall say, [Thou art] my God.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Then the LORD said unto me again, Go, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the sons of Israel, who look to other gods and love flagons of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her for myself for fifteen [pieces] of silver and a homer and a half of barley:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for [another] man: so [will] I also [be] for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the sons of Israel shall abide many days without king and without Lord and without sacrifice and without image, and without ephod and [without] teraphim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>afterward the sons of Israel shall return, and they shall seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the end of the days.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear [the] word of the LORD, [ye] sons of Israel; for the LORD contends with the inhabitants of the land because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>By swearing and lying and murdering and stealing and committing adultery, they prevailed, and blood touches blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the earth shall mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall be cut off, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven; and even the fishes of the sea shall be caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Certainly man [does] not contend [with] nor reprehend man; for thy people [are] as those that resist the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>Therefore thou shalt fall in the day, and the prophet shall also fall with thee by night, and I will cut off thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people were cut off because they lacked wisdom; because thou hast rejected wisdom, I will cast thee out of the priesthood; [seeing] thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>According to their greatness, so did they sin against me; [therefore] I will change their honour into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They eat up the sin of my people, and in their iniquity they raise up their soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>The people shall become like the priest; and I will visit his ways upon him, and they shall reward him according to his doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>For they shall eat and not be satisfied; they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have quit showing hospitality unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel of their wooden [idol], and their stick declares unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms has caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring under their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, that had good shade; therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not visit upon your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor upon your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery: for they offer with whores, and they sacrifice with [cult] prostitutes; therefore the people without understanding shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judah be guilty; and do not come unto Gilgal, neither go up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>for Israel has turned away as a wild heifer; shall the LORD now feed them as rams in a large place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim [is] given over to idols; leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink has become corrupted; they have committed whoredom continually; her princes love gifts, shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king because the judgment [is] for you, for ye have been a snare in Mizpah and a net spread over Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And in killing sacrifices ye have descended into the depths; therefore, I [shall be] the correction of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou dost commit whoredom, [and] Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>They will not think about returning unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms [is] in the midst of them, and they do not know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity; Judah shall also fall with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds seeking the LORD; but they shall not find [him]; he has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have rebelled against the LORD; for they have begotten strange sons; now a month shall devour them with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye the shofar in Gibeah [and] the trumpet in Ramah; sound the drum in Bethaven; after thee, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be made desolate [in] the day of chastisement; in the tribes of Israel I made known [my] truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah were like those that move the boundaries; [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment because he wanted to walk after commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore I [will be] unto Ephraim as a moth and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>And Ephraim shall see his sickness and Judah his wound; [then] Ephraim shall go to the Assyrian and shall send to king Jareb; yet he shall not be able to heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I [will be] unto Ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, [even] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and there shall be no one [left] to escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go [and] return to my place until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face; in their affliction they will seek me early.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return unto the LORD; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days he shall give us life: in the third day he will resurrect us, and we shall live in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>And we shall know and follow on in knowing the LORD; his going forth is prepared as the dawn; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter [and] former rain unto the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? Your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore I have hewed [them]by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: that thy righteousness [be] as the light [that] goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they have transposed the covenant as of men: there they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead [is] a city of those that work iniquity [and is] polluted with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, [so] the council of priests murder in the way by common accord; for they put the abomination into effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>I saw uncleanness in the house of Israel: there Ephraim played the harlot, Israel defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, Judah placed [a] plant in thee when I had turned the captivity of my people.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I was healing Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they worked deceit; and the thief comes in, [and] the troop of robbers spoils without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they do not consider in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They [are] all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker [who] shall cease from waking after he has kneaded the dough until it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with [a] wineskin; he stretched out his hand with the scorners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait; their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen; [there is] no one among them that calls unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know [it]; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he does not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel shall testify to his face, and they have not returned to the LORD their God, nor have they sought him with all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>Ephraim also was like a deceived dove, without understanding; they shall call to Egypt, they shall go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them according to what has been heard in their congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction upon them! because they have rebelled against me; [though] I have ransomed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds; they congregated themselves for the wheat and the wine, [and] they rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet they imagine evil against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They returned, [but] not to the most High; they were like a deceitful bow; their princes fell by the sword for the arrogance of their tongue; this [shall be] their derision in the land of Egypt.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>[Set] the shofar to thy mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we have known thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have reigned, but not by me; they have made dominion, and I knew [it] not; of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Thy calf, O Samaria, has cast [thee] off; my anger has been kindled against them until they could no longer be absolved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For it is of Israel; and [a] workman made it who is not God: because the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; they shall have no harvest; the fruit shall yield no meal: if so be it yields, the strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel shall be swallowed up; soon they shall be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which [there is] no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass [thinking] only of himself; Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Even though they hire the Gentiles, now I will gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king and of the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, the altars shall be a sin unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as strange things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>In the sacrifices of my gifts they sacrificed flesh and ate; [but] the LORD does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker and has built temples; and Judah has multiplied fenced cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Do not rejoice, O Israel, for joy, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved the [salary of a harlot] upon every threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not remain in the land of the LORD; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt and to Assyria where they shall eat unclean food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not pour out wine unto the LORD, neither shall he take pleasure in their sacrifices; as the bread of mourners [shall they be] unto them; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall not enter into the house of the LORD because of their soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will ye do in the solemn day, and [in] the day of the feast of the LORD?</verse>
