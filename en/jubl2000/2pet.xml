      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those that have obtained like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you in the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>as all things that pertain to life and to godliness are given us of his divine power, through the knowledge of him that has called us by his glory and virtue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be made participants of the divine nature, having fled the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>Ye also, giving all diligence to the same, show forth virtue in your faith; and in virtue, knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and in knowledge, temperance; and in temperance, patience; and in patience, fear of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and in fear of God, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things are in you and abound, they shall not let you be idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>But he that lacks these things is blind and walks feeling the way with his hand, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brethren, give all the more diligence to make your calling and election sure; for doing these things, ye shall never fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>Because in this manner the entrance shall be abundantly administered unto you in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>For this [reason], I will not leave off reminding you always of these things, although ye know [them] and are established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>Because I have [the] right (as long as I am in this tabernacle) to stir you up by reminding [you],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has declared unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>I will also make sure with diligence that after my decease ye might remember these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we have not made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cunningly devised fables, but as eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And we heard this voice which came from heaven, when we were together with him in the holy mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>We have also the most sure word of the prophets, unto which ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>understanding this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>For the prophecy did not come in times past by the will of man, but the holy men of God spoke being inspired by the Holy Spirit.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who covertly shall bring in destructive sects and shall deny the Lord that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>and in covetousness they shall make merchandise of you with feigned words, upon whom the condemnation from a long time ago does not delay, and their perdition does not sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not forgive the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down into the deepest abyss and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and if [he] did not forgive the old world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven other persons, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and if [he] condemned by destruction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, turning them into ashes, making [them] an example unto those that after should live without fear and reverence of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and delivered just Lot, who was persecuted by those abominable [people] because of their nefarious conversation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, afflicted [his] righteous soul from day to day with the deeds of those unjust [people]);</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and chiefly those that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise dominion; presumptuous, arrogant, they are not afraid to speak evil of the higher powers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas even the angels, who are greater in power and might, bring no curse of judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, speaking evil of the things that they do not understand (as natural animals without reason, who are made to be taken and destroyed), shall utterly perish in their own corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>receiving the reward of their unrighteousness, [as] those that count it pleasure to live luxuriously every day. These are spots and blemishes, who eat [together] with you, while at the same time they revel in their deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having their eyes full of adultery, and not knowing [how] to cease from sin, baiting unstable souls, having their heart exercised in covetous practices; cursed sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>who forsaking the right way have erred, having followed the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>and was rebuked for his iniquity; a dumb animal accustomed to a yoke (upon which he was seated), speaking with man's voice, hindered the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are wells without water, clouds that are brought by [a] whirlwind, to whom gross darkness is reserved for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For speaking arrogant words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from those who converse in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them liberty, being they themselves the servants of corruption: for he who is overcome by someone is subject to bondage by the one that overcame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>Certainly, if having separated themselves from the contaminations of the world, by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they again entangle themselves therein and are overcome, their latter end is made worse for them than the beginnings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog returns unto his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Beloved, I now write unto you this second epistle, in which I alert with exhortation your pure understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>that ye keep in memory the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of our commandment, that we are apostles of the Lord and Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For since the day in which the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>Of course, they willingly ignore that the heavens were [created] of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water, by the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>but the heavens, which are now, and the earth are conserved by the same word, kept unto the fire in the day of judgment and of perdition of the ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day before the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not late concerning his promise, as some count lateness, but is patient with us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements, burning, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>waiting for and desiring earnestly for the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>Nevertheless we, according to his promises, wait for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, seeing that ye hope for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And have as saving health the patience of our Lord, even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>in almost all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things, among which are some things [that] are hard to understand, which those that are ignorant and unstable twist, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Ye, therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] in advance, be on guard lest by the error of the wicked ye be deceived with the others and fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in grace and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and until the day of eternity. Amen.:</verse>
