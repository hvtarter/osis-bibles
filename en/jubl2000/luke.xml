  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have attempted to set forth in order the history of those things which among us have been most certain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>even as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning taught us and [thus] were ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good also to me, after having understood all the things from the beginning with great diligence, to write them unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that thou mightest know the security of those things in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were [now] well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense entering into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw [him], he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the rebellious to the prudence of the just, to make ready a prepared people for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife [is] well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee this gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he communicated with signs and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came in unto her and said, Hail, [thou that art] highly favoured, the Lord [is] with thee; blessed [art] thou among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his words and wondered in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>Then the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called [the] Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And, behold, thy relative Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her, who [was] called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing is impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and she spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed [is] she that believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saving Health,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden; for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty has done great things unto me, and holy [is] his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy [is] on those that fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down the mighty from [their] thrones and exalted the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has received his servant Israel in remembrance of [his] mercy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months and then returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and her relatives heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not [so], but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they communicated with signs to his father, [asking] how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing table and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spoke blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were spoken of throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those that heard [them] laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, Who shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and made redemption for his people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And has raised up a horn of saving health for us in the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as he spoke by the mouth of the saints who from the beginning were his prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to fulfill mercy unto our fathers and remembering his holy covenant</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>of the oath which he made to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>that he would grant unto us, that without fear delivered out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, shalt be called prophet of the Most High, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>giving knowledge of saving health unto his people for the remission of their sins</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the bowels of mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those that dwell in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and was comforted of the Spirit and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>([And] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be taxed, each one into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and family of David)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, behold, [the] angel of the Lord came upon them, and [the] clarity of [the] Lord shone round about them, and they feared greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>But the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you [a] gospel of great joy, which shall be to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For unto you is born this day in the city of David [a] Saviour, who is Christ [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will in man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen [it], they made known abroad that which had been told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all those that heard [it] marvelled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, pondering [them] in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which he was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present [him] to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name [was] Simeon, and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he should see the Christ of [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>then he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for mine eyes have seen thy saving health,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light to be revealed unto the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age and had lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she [was] a widow eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spoke of him to all those that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew and was comforted of [the] Spirit, filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And having completed the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey, and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Knew ye not that it behooves me to be about my Father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the word which he spoke unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and [in] age and in grace with God and men.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came upon John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching [the] baptism of repentance for [the] remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked [ways] shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the Saving Health of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham [for our] father; for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God, and the twelve with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered unto him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when many people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell along the way, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon the rock, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And some fell on good ground and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those along the way are those that hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock [are] those that when they hear, receive the word with joy, but these have no root, who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns are those who when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are those who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep [it] and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No one when they have lighted a lamp cover it with a vessel or put [it] under a bed, but set [it] on a candlestick, that those who enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither [any thing] hid that shall not be known and come to light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples, and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed, he fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were being filled [with] [water] and were in jeopardy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons for a long time and wore no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven of the demon into the wilderness.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion, because many demons were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons went out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When those that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled and went and told [it] in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who saw [it] told them by what means he that was possessed of the demons was saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them, for they were taken with great fear; and he went up into the ship and returned back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man out of whom the demons were departed besought him that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thine own house and tell what great things God has done unto thee. And he went, preaching throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass that when Jesus returned, the people received him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was [a] prince of the synagogue, and he fell down at Jesus' feet and besought him that he would come into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And, behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in majesty and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they awoke, they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to remain here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was speaking this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days any of those things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And, behold, a man of the multitude cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And, behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it throws him into convulsions with foaming, and with difficulty it departs from him, bruising him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring thy son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was yet a coming, the demon threw him down into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they all wondered at all [the] things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this word, and it was hid from them that they should not understand, and they feared to ask him regarding this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then there arose a dispute among them, which of them should be [the] greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and set him by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me; for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not, for he that is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before his face; and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of man is not come to lose men's souls, but to save [them]. And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass that as they went in the way, a certain [man] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the heaven [have] nests, but the Son of man has not where to lay [his] head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and declare the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but let me first go bid farewell those who are at home at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>And Jesus said unto him, No one having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone us; for they are certain that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered that they knew not from where.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Then Jesus said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard, but the husbandmen beat him and sent [him] away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant, and they beat him also and treated [him] shamefully and sent [him] away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third, and they wounded him also and cast [him] out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence [him] when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it], they said, May it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he beheld them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the princes of the priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them; but they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched [him] and sent forth spies who feigned themselves just men that they might take hold of him as he was speaking, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou accept the person [of any], but teachest the way of God with truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he, perceiving their craftiness, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they could not take hold of his words before the people, and they marvelled at his answer and were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then certain of the Sadducees came, who deny that there is any resurrection, and they asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were therefore seven brethren, and the first took a wife and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also, and they left no children and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? for seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said unto them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are accounted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry, nor are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed [this] at the bush when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And after that they dared not ask him any [question at all].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said unto them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him Lord; how is he then his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then in the audience of all the people, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at suppers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the houses of the widows and for a pretext make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Then Pilate, calling together the princes of the priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverts the people; and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things of which ye accuse him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you to him; and, behold, he has done nothing worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him and release [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried, saying, crucify him, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will therefore chastise him and let [him] go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they insisted with loud voices, asking that he be crucified. And the voices of them and of the princes of the priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be according to their request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the stake, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren and the wombs that never bare and the breasts which never gave suck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they were come to the place, which is called of the Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding. And the princes also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And when it was about the sixth hour, there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit; and having said thus, he gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned smiting their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a senator; [and he was] a good man and just</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(the same had not consented in the counsel nor in their deeds); [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of Judea, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This [man] went unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, where no one had ever been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with him from Galilee also followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now upon the first of the sabbaths, very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and as they were afraid and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered his words</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary [the mother] of James and other [women that were] with them who told these things unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter arose and ran unto the sepulchre, and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was [about] sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went together with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held fast that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>Then he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the princes of the priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel, and beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Although also certain women of our company made us astonished, who before daybreak were at the sepulchre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said; but they did not see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter (like this) into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded [this] unto them in all the scriptures concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near unto the village where they went, and he made as though he would have gone further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass as he sat [at the table] with them, he took bread and blessed [it] and broke and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us in the way and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and those that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord is risen indeed and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told what things [were done] in the way and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they were seeing a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them [his] hands and [his] feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And [as they were] not believing him yet for joy and wondering, he said unto them, Have ye here any food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took [it] and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and [in] the prophets and [in] the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And ye are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And, behold, I shall send the promise of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye are endued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.:</verse>
