  <div type='book' osisID='Job'>
      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and departed from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses, and a very great store of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and had banquets [in their] houses, each one on his day, and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of [their] banquets were over, that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Where dost thou come from? Then Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands; therefore, his substance has increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has, [and thou shalt see] if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has [is] in thy power; only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>and a messenger came unto Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans fell [upon them] and took them away; they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he [was] yet speaking, another came who said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he [was] yet speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans made three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he [was] yet speaking, there another came and said, Thy sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Where dost thou come from? And Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil and that he still retains his perfection, although thou didst incite me against him to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD and said, Skin for skin, all that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, [and thou shalt see] if he does not blaspheme thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in thy hand, but preserve his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd to scratch himself with, and he was sitting among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Blaspheme God and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, Thou hast spoken as any of the foolish women speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now three friends of Job, Eliphaz, the Temanite, Bildad, the Shuhite, and Zophar, the Naamathite, [when] they heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept; and each one rent his mantle and sprinkled dust upon his head toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that [his] grief was very great.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job spoke and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>O, let that night be solitary; let no song come therein!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its dawn be darkened; they waited for light, but [have] none; neither let them see the dawning of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb nor hide the misery from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die from the womb? [Why] did I [not] give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Of what use the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with the kings and the counsellors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or, [why] was I not hidden as an untimely birth, as infants [who] never saw light?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>[There] the prisoners rest together, they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there, and the servant [is] free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who long for death, but it [comes] not; and search for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>who rejoice exceedingly [and] are glad when they can find the grave;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>to the man who does not know which way he goes and whom God has hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I never had prosperity, nor did I secure myself, neither was I at rest; yet trouble came.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz, the Temanite, answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If we attempt to commune with thee, thou wilt be grieved. But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upheld the one that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now that it is come upon thee, thou art grieved; it touches thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, those that plow iniquity and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the spirit of his anger they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now the matter was also hidden from me, but my ear has perceived a little of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In imaginations of visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before me which caused the hair of my flesh to stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>A ghost stood in front of me, whose face I did not recognize, and I heard it say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he put no trust in his servants, and his angels he charged with folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more [with] those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [who] shall be crushed by the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>They are destroyed from morning to evening; they perish for ever without anyone regarding [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Does their beauty perish with them? They die and do not know.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now, if there shall be anyone to answer thee; and if there shall be any of the saints for thee to look unto?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>It is certain that wrath kills the foolish man, and envy consumes the covetous one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root, but at the same time I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His sons are far from saving health, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and there shall be no one to deliver [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>The hungry shall eat up his harvest, and even take it out from among the thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For the iniquity does not come forth out of the dust; neither does chastisement spring up out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>I would certainly seek God, and unto God would I commit my affairs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>who does great things that no one can understand, and marvels that have no explanation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters abroad;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>who sets up the humble on high, that those who mourn may be lifted up with saving health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own prudence, and the counsel of his adversaries is turned to folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves the poor from the sword, from the mouth of the wicked, and from the hand of the violent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>Who is the hope of the poor, and iniquity closes her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, blessed [is] the man whom God chastens; therefore, do not despise not the correction of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he makes sore, and binds up; he wounds, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He shall deliver thee in six tribulations, and in the seventh no evil shall touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he shall ransom thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent, and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shalt know that thy seed [is] great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come to [thy] grave in a full age, like a shock [of wheat] that is gathered in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Behold that which we have searched out, so it [is]; hear it and judge [it] for thyself.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>And Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my grief and calamity were justly weighed and laid equally in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore, my words are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me; my spirit drinks of the poison; and terrors of God combat me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild ass bray when he has grass? Does the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? Or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>The things [that] my soul refused to touch [before, now] by my sorrow [are] my food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh, that I might have my request and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to destroy me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then should my comfort grow; I would hold on to sorrow without mercy; for I have not contradicted the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What [is] my strength that I should hope? What [is] my end that I should prolong my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>[Is] my strength the strength of stones? Or [is] my flesh of steel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Am I not doing all that I can, and [even with all this] I lack the power to do anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>He that is afflicted [deserves] mercy from his friend; but he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have lied to me as a brook; they passed away as an impetuous stream,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>which was hidden by ice and covered by snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>Which in the time of heat, they vanish; when they are heated, they disappear out of their place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>they turn aside out of the paths of their way; they go to nothing and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The travelers of Tema looked; the traveling companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because of their hope; they came there and found them confused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>Now ye are certainly as they; ye have seen the torment and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Bring unto me and pay for me out of your substance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>and deliver me from the enemy's hand and ransom me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will be silent; and cause me to understand in what I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are the words of rectitude! But what does your argument reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Are ye not thinking up words of reproof and [throw] to the wind words that are lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Ye also overwhelm the fatherless and dig a pit before your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now, therefore, if ye desire, look upon me and [see] if I shall lie in your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Turn now, and there is no iniquity; return again [to look] for my righteousness in this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>If there is iniquity in my tongue or if my taste cannot discern the torments.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Man certainly has an appointed [amount of] time upon earth, and his days are like the days of a hireling.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.29.1'>Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.2'>Oh, that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.3'>when his candle shone upon my head, and by its light I walked in the darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.4'>as I was in the days of my youth, when God was familiar in my tent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.5'>when the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.6'>when I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.7'>When I went out to the gate to judgment, [when] I had my seat prepared in the plaza!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.8'>The young men would see me and hide themselves, and the aged would arise [and] stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.9'>The princes would refrain from talking and lay [their] hand on their mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.10'>the voice of the principals would not be noticed, and their tongue would cleave to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.11'>When the ears that heard me, called me blessed; and when the eyes that saw me, gave witness to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.12'>because I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless who had no one to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.13'>The blessing of the one that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.14'>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me as a robe; and my diadem was judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.15'>I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.16'>I [was] a father to the needy; and the cause [which] I did not know I searched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.17'>And I broke the fangs of the wicked and caused their teeth to release the prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.18'>Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.19'>My root [is] spread out by the waters, and the dew shall remain upon my branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.20'>My glory is renewed with me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.21'>They would hear me and wait, and keep silent at my counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.22'>After my words they would not reply, but my reason dropped upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.23'>And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.24'>[If] I laughed at them, they did not believe [it]; and they did not cast down the light of my countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.29.25'>I approved their way and sat at the head and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforts the mourners.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.30'>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.1'>But now [those that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.2'>For, unto what [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom time was lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.3'>For want and famine [they walked] alone; fleeing into solitude, to the dark place, desolate and waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.4'>Who cut up mallows among the bushes and juniper roots [for] their food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.5'>They were driven forth from among [men] (they cried after them as [after] a thief).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.6'>They dwelt in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.7'>Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.8'>[They were] sons of fools and men without names; they were lower than the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.9'>And now I am their song, and I am their byword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.10'>They abhor me, they distance themselves from me, and do not spare to spit in my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.11'>Because [God] has loosed my cord and afflicted me, they have also gone out of control before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.12'>Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.13'>They cast down my path, they took advantage of my calamity, against them there was no helper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.14'>They came in as through a wide breach; they were stirred up because of my calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.15'>They have loosed terrors upon me; they fought my will as the wind and my saving health as a cloud that passes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.16'>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.17'>My bones pierce me in the night, and my sinews take no rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.18'>By the great force [of my disease] my garment is changed; it binds me about as the collar of my coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.19'>He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.20'>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me; I present myself, and thou regardest me [not].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.21'>Thou art become cruel to me; with the strength of thy hand thou dost hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.22'>Thou didst lift me up and cause me to ride upon the wind, and didst dissolve my being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.23'>For I know [that] thou dost conduct me unto death and [to] the house appointed for all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.24'>But he will not stretch out [his] hand against the grave; do those who are buried cry out when he destroys them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.25'>Did I not weep for the one that was in trouble? Was [not] my soul grieved for the needy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.26'>When I expected good, then evil came [unto me]; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.27'>My bowels boil and do not rest; the days of affliction came upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.28'>I went about darkened, but not by the sun; I stood up and cried out in the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.29'>I have become a brother to dragons and a companion to owls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.30'>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.30.31'>My harp is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.31'>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.1'>I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon a maid?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.2'>For what reward would God [give me] from above and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.3'>Is there no destruction for the wicked? And banishment for the workers of iniquity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.4'>Does he not see my ways and count all my steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.5'>If I have walked with falsehood or if my foot has hastened to deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.6'>let me be weighed in a just balance, that God may know my integrity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.7'>If my step has turned out of the way and my heart walked after my eyes and if any blot has cleaved to my hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.8'>[then] let me sow, and let another eat, and let my offspring be rooted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.9'>If my heart has been deceived regarding a woman, or [if] I have laid in wait at my neighbour's door,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.10'>[then] let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.11'>For this is lewdness and iniquity that is proven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.12'>For it [is] a fire [that] consumes unto Sheol and would root out all my increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.13'>If I had despised the right of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.14'>what then would I do when God rises up? And when he visits, what would I answer him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.15'>Did not he that made me in the belly [also] make him? And did not [the same] one fashion us in the womb?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.16'>If I have disturbed the desire of the poor or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.17'>or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.18'>(for from my youth the [fatherless] was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided the [widow] from my mother's womb)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.19'>if I have seen any perish for want of clothing or any needy without [a] covering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.20'>if his loins have not blessed me and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.21'>if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw that they would all help me in the gate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.22'>[then] let my back fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its joint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.23'>For I feared destruction [from] God, against whose highness I could have no power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.24'>If I have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.25'>if I rejoiced because my wealth [was] being multiplied, and because my hand had gotten much;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.26'>if I beheld the sun when it shone or the moon walking [in] beauty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.27'>and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth kissed my hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.28'>this would also be a proven iniquity; for I should have denied the God that is sovereign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.29'>If I rejoiced at the destruction of the one that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.30'>for I have never even suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse upon his soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.31'>when the servants of my tent said, Oh that we had of his flesh! We would never be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.32'>The stranger did not lodge in the street, [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.33'>If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.34'>if I feared a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] did not go out of the door?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.31.36'>Surely I would take it upon my shoulder [and] bind it [as] a crown to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.37'>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince I would go near unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.31.38'>If my land cries against me and all its furrows likewise complain;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.31.40'>let thistles grow up unto me instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.32'>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.1'>So these three men ceased to answer Job because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.2'>Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was kindled; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.3'>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.4'>Now Elihu had waited until Job had spoken because they [were all] elder than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.5'>But when Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.6'>And Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, answered and said, I [am] younger, and ye [are] older; therefore, I was afraid, and I feared to declare unto you my opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.7'>I said, Days shall speak, and the multitude of years shall declare wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.8'>Certainly [there is] a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.9'>Great men are not [always] wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.10'>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will declare my knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.11'>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your arguments, while ye searched out what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.12'>Even so, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you to reproved Job [or] to answer his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.13'>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom; it is needful that God thrust him down, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.14'>Now he has not directed [his] words against me; neither will I answer him with your reasons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.15'>They were amazed, they answered no more; they left off speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.16'>And I waited, (for they did not speak, but stopped, [and] answered no more);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.17'>[I said], I will also answer my part, I will also declare my opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.18'>For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.19'>Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] has no vent; it is ready to burst forth like spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.20'>I will speak, that I may be able to breathe; I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.21'>I will not now be a respecter of persons, neither will I give flattering titles unto man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.32.22'>For I do not know [how] to give flattering titles; [otherwise] my maker would soon take me away.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.33'>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.1'>Therefore, Job, hear now my reasons, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.2'>Behold, now I shall open my mouth, my tongue shall speak in my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.3'>My reasons declare the uprightness of my heart; and my lips shall utter pure knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.4'>The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.5'>If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.6'>Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead; I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.7'>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.8'>Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.9'>I am clean without rebellion, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.10'>Behold, [God] sought occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.11'>he put my feet in the stocks, he guards all my paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.12'>Behold, [in] this thou art not just; I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.13'>Why dost thou strive against him? For he will not answer all of thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.14'>Nevertheless, in one or two manners God speaks to the one who does not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.15'>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.16'>then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.17'>that he may withdraw the man [from his own] work and cover the man from pride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.18'>[Thus] he keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.19'>He is chastened also upon his bed with strong pain in all his bones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.20'>so that his life abhorrs bread and his soul dainty food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.21'>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.22'>His soul shall draw near to the grave, and his life to those that would bury him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.23'>If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.24'>to tell him that [God] had mercy on him, that he delivered him from going down to the pit; that he found a ransom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.25'>his flesh shall become more tender than a child's; and he shall return to the days of his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.26'>He shall pray unto God, and he will love him; and he shall see his face with shouts of joy; for he will render unto the man the recompense of his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.27'>He looks upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned and perverted [that which was] right, and it did not profit me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.28'>[God] will ransom his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.29'>Behold, God does all these thing two and three times with man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.30'>to turn back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.31'>Hear me, O Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.33.32'>If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.34'>
        <verse osisID='Job.34.1'>Furthermore, Elihu answered and said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.40.22'>The shady [trees] cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.23'>Behold, he shall drink up a river [and] not change; he trusts that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.24'>His maker shall take him by [the weakness of] his eyes in a snare, and pierce through his nose.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou canst do every [thing] and [that] there is no thought hidden from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who [is] he that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore, I have denounced that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask of thee, and thou shalt cause me to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>With [my ears] I had heard thee; but now my eyes see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore, I abhor [myself] and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz, the Temanite, My wrath has been kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken by me in uprightness, as my servant Job [has].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Therefore, take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for only because I will accept him, I shall not deal with you [according to your] folly, in that ye have not spoken by me in uprightness, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz, the Temanite, and Bildad, the Shuhite, [and] Zophar, the Naamathite, went, and did according as the LORD commanded them; and the LORD accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends; also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then all his brethren came unto him and all his sisters and all those that had been of his acquaintance before and ate bread with him in his house; and they condoled him and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; each one also gave him an ewe, and an earring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemima, and the name of the second, Kezia, and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land no women were found [as] beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, [being] old and full of days.:</verse>
