        <description>Translated from the Original Texts in Hebrew and Greek into Spanish by Casiodoro de Reina (1569) and compared with the revision of Cipriano de Valera (1602). Based on the New Testament of Francisco de Enzinas (1543) and on the New Testament (1556) with the Psalms (1557) of Juan Perez de Pineda.\par This material was translated from Spanish into English by Russell M. Stendal and compared with the Old English Translation of William Tyndale (Pentateuch of 1530, Ploughboy Edition New Testament of 1534, Joshua to 2 Chronicles of 1537, and Jonah). It was also compared word for word with the Authorized Version (by King James) of 1611.

  <div type='book' osisID='Acts'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The former treatise I have made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until the day in which, having given commandments by [the] Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen, he was received on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>unto whom he also showed himself alive, after he had suffered, by many infallible proofs, appearing unto them for forty days and speaking to them of the kingdom of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>and gathering them together, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, Which, [he said], ye have heard of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John truly baptized in water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Then those that were come together asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put under his authority only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But ye shall receive the virtue of the Holy Spirit which shall come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, Ye men of Galilee, what do ye stand gazing at [up] into heaven? This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said (the number of names together were about one hundred and twenty),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men [and] brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to those that took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained a lot [or inheritance] of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>He, therefore, purchased a field with the reward of [his] iniquity; and hanging himself, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it was known unto all the dwellers of Jerusalem, in such a manner that the field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell therein, and let another take his office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It behooves, therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was received on high from [among] us, that one must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of everyone, show which of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>that he may take the lot [or inheritance] of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas rebelled that he might go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>(And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>Now at this sound, the multitude came together and were confounded because each one heard them speak in his own tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how do we hear each one [speak] in our own tongue, with which we were brought up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, What does this mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Then Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea and all [ye] that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>and [for] certain on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>and I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord [shall] come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>and it shall come to pass [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover even my flesh shall rest in hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>he, seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God has raised up, of whom we all are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore being raised up by the right hand of God and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I make thy foes thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now when they heard [this], they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men [and] brethren, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized each one of you into the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off, [even] as many as the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>So that those who gladly received his word were baptized, and the same day there were added [unto them] about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all that believed were together and had all things common</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and sold their possessions and property and distributed them to everyone, as each one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, [they] ate their food together with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that entered into the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked [for] alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have I give thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And he took him by the right hand and lifted [him] up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as the lame man who was healed held [onto] Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And when Peter saw [it], he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own virtue or godliness we had made this man walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he had judged to let [him] go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and killed the Author of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And in the faith of his name, unto this man whom ye see and know, has confirmed his name; and the faith which is by him has given this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did [it] as [did] also your princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But God has thus fulfilled those things which he had showed in advance by the mouth of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out, for the times of refreshing of the presence of the Lord are come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>who has sent Jesus Christ, who before was preached unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom it is certainly necessary that the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the age [began].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things [doing] whatever he shall say unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it shall come to pass [that] every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>Ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, that each one of you might turn from his iniquities.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And as they spoke unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>resentful that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them and put [them] in jail unto the next day, for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it came to pass on the next day that their princes and elders and scribes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power or by what name have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye princes of the people and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him does this man stand here before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men in which we can be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them [is] manifest to all those that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them that from now on they speak to no man in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>Then Peter and John answered and said unto them, Judge whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way how they might punish them because of the people, for everyone glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being let go, they went to their own company and reported all that the princes of the priests and the elders had said unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, thou [art the] God, who hast made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who (in the Holy Spirit) by the mouth of thy servant David (our father) hast said, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth were present, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For of a truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together (in this city),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do that which thy hand and thy counsel had determined beforehand must be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>that thou might stretch forth thine hand so that healings and signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>And of the multitude of those that had believed was one heart and one soul; no one said that anything he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>Neither was there any among them that lacked, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and defrauded of the price, his wife also being aware of [it], and brought a certain part and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to defraud of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>Retaining it, was it not thy own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the spirit; and great fear came on all those that heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried [him] out and buried [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Then Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried thy husband [are] at the door and shall carry thee out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the spirit; and the young men came in and found her dead and, carrying [her] forth, buried [her] by her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were wrought in the people. (And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>And of the others, no one dared join themself to them, but the people magnified them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>And those that believed in the Lord increased in number, multitudes both of men and women.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>So much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid [them] on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>There came also a multitude [out] of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks and those who were tormented with unclean spirits, and they were healed every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Then the prince of the priests rose up, and all those that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And when they heard [that], they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught. In the meantime, the prince of the priests came, and those that were with him, and called the council together and all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But when the officers came and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, We certainly found the prison shut with all security and the keepers standing outside before the doors, but when we had opened, we found no one within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the princes of the priests heard these things, they were perplexed regarding what this would come to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Then someone came and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain with the officers went and brought them without violence, for they feared being stoned by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And when they had brought them, they set [them] before the council, and the prince of the priests asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, Did we not strictly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We must persuade God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God has exalted him with his right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are his witnesses of these things, and [so is] also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those that persuade him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When they heard [that], they were divided and took counsel to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>Then a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, who had a reputation among all the people, stood up in the council and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as concerning these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days, rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away many people after him; he also perished, and all those that consented with him were dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nought,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they agreed with him; and when they had called the apostles and beaten [them], they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>And daily in the temple and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach the gospel of Jesus the Christ.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, that their widows were neglected in the daily ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples [unto them] and said, It is not right that we should leave the word of God and serve tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>therefore, brethren, seek out among you seven men of whom you bear witness, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and also a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles in the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of those of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and [against] God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the prince of the priests said, Are these things so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and dwelt in Haran; and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which ye now dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not [so much as] to set his foot on; yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him, when [as yet] he had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>And God spoke thus, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage and mistreat [them] four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>And the Gentiles unto whom they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God; and after that they shall come forth and serve me in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so [Abraham] begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day, and Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob [begat] the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt, but God was with him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him grace and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers found no sustenance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him the gospel of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they went on [their] way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch said, See, [here is] water; what hinders me to be baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>And Philip said, If thou dost believe with all thine heart, thou may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they went both down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, [so] that the eunuch saw him no more, and he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>But Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came unto the prince of the priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and asked him for letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And as he proceeded, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>and falling to the earth, he heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I AM Jesus whom thou dost persecute; [it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behooves thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice, but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Then Saul arose from the earth; and opening his eyes, he saw no one; so they led him by the hand and brought [him] into Damascus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>where he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; to whom the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I [am here], Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and enquire in the house of Judas for [one] called Saul, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting [his] hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, [of] how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said unto him, Go; for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Then Ananias went and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared unto thee in the way as thou didst come, has sent me, that thou might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and he received sight immediately and arose and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And when he had received food, he was comforted. Then Saul was certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>But all that heard [him] were amazed and said, Is not this he that destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the princes of the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And as many days passed, the Jews took counsel among themselves to kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but their ambushes were understood by Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>Then the disciples took him by night and let [him] down by the wall in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought [him] to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all [quarters], he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in bed eight years, for he was a paralytic.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the company called the Italian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>[a] devout [man] and one that feared God with all his house, who gave many alms to the people and prayed to God always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying unto him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And when he looked on him, he was afraid and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa and call for [one] Simon, whose surname is Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side; he shall tell thee what it behooves thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those that waited on him continually;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and when he had declared all [these] things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the morrow, as they went on their journey and drew near unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>and he became very hungry and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a rapture of understanding</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and reptiles and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And the voice [spoke] unto him again the second time, That which God has cleansed, do not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was done three times, and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house and stood before the gate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Arise therefore and get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter went down to the men who were sent unto him from Cornelius and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek; what [is] the cause for which ye are come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Then he called them in and lodged [them]. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many that were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an abominable thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore I came [unto you] without doubting, as soon as I was sent for; I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of [one] Simon a tanner by the sea side, who, when he comes, shall speak unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well to come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter opened [his] mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The word which [God] sent unto the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel: peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>that word, [I say], ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of Judea and in Jerusalem, whom they slew hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>This same [one] God raised up the third day and showed him openly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he who is ordained of God [to be] the Judge of living and dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>Unto him all the prophets give witness, that whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins through his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they begged him to tarry certain days.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>When Peter was come up to Jerusalem, those that were of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised and eat with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter rehearsed [the matter] from the beginning and expounded [it] by order unto them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a rapture of understanding I saw a vision: A certain vessel descended like a great sheet let down from heaven by the four corners, and it came unto me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and reptiles and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter, slay and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, do not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this was done three times, and it was all drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit bade me go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said unto him, Send to Joppa and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who shall tell thee words, by which thou and all thy house shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John indeed baptized in water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>So then, if God gave them the same gift as [he did] unto us, who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should withstand God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance unto life to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now those who were scattered abroad by the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to no one except only unto the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came into Antioch, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go unto Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad and exhorted them all to remain in [their] purpose of heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>And it came to pass that for a whole year they gathered themselves together with the church and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>And in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples, each one according to what he had, determined to send relief unto the brethren who dwelt in Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which they likewise did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now at that time Herod the king stretched forth [his] hands to mistreat certain of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>And when he had apprehended him, he put [him] in prison and delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Peter therefore was kept in the prison, and the church made prayer without unto God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door that kept the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon [him], and a light shone in the prison, and he smote Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from [his] hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he said unto him, Cast thy garment about thee and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And he went out and followed him and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>When they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leads unto the city, which opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street, and then the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod and [from] all the people of the Jews who waited for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And considering [this], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And as Peter knocked at the door of the patio, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And when she recognized Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in and told how Peter stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened [the door] and saw him, they were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to be silent, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go make these things known unto James and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers [concerning] what was become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And when Herod had sought for him and found him not, he examined the guards and commanded that [they] should be taken away. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And Herod was highly displeased with those of Tyre and Sidon, but they came with one accord to him, and, having bribed Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace because their lands were supplied through those of the king's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the people gave a shout, [saying, It is] the voice of god, and not of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he did not give God the glory, and he expired eaten of worms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of the Lord grew and multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled [their] ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work unto which I have called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>And when they had fasted and prayed and laid [their] hands on them, they released [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed unto Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And when they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John as an attendant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain wise man, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name [was] Barjesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the wise man (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>Then Saul (who also [is] Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, O full of all deception and all licentiousness, [thou] son of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord [is] against thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Now when Paul and his company sailed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; then John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the princes of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, [Ye] men [and] brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with [his] hand said, Men of Israel and ye that fear God hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>And [for] the time of about forty years, he suffered their manners in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>And after that he gave [unto them] judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And afterward they asked for a king, and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, saying, I have found David, the [son] of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall fulfil all my will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>Of this man's seed has God according to [his] promise raised up Jesus as Saviour unto Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>John having first proclaimed before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not [he]. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Men [and] brethren, sons of the lineage of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, unto you is this word of saving health sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For those that dwell at Jerusalem and their princes, because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets who are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled [them] in condemning [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>And without finding cause of death [in him], yet they asked Pilate that he should be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took [him] down from the tree and laid [him] in a sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>and he was seen many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who until now are his witnesses unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we declare unto you the gospel of the promise which was made unto the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>which God has fulfilled unto us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said this, I will give you the sure mercies [promised] to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Therefore he also says in another place, Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep and was gathered unto his fathers and saw corruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Be it known unto you, therefore, men [and] brethren, that through this one is preached unto you the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and in him all that believe are justified from all the things from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Beware, therefore, lest what is spoken of in the prophets come upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish, for I do a work in your days, a work which ye would in no wise believe, if one should declare it unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And when they were gone out of the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>Now when the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to remain in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And the next sabbath day almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and spoke against that which Paul said, contradicting and blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Then Paul and Barnabas speaking with freedom, said, It was necessary indeed that the word of God should first have been spoken to you; but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so has the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should be for saving health unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the principals of the city and raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And it came to pass in Iconium that they went [both] together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the disobedient Jews stirred up the Gentiles and corrupted their desire against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>With all this, they abode there a long time speaking with freedom in the Lord, who gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted that signs and wonders be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the multitude of the city was divided, and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their princes, to insult [them] and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they were aware of [it] and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lies round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they preached the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man sat at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>this [man] heard Paul speak, who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius because he was the chief speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought bulls and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice unto them with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>[Which] when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard [of it], they rent their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are therein,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in generations past suffered all the Gentiles to walk in their own ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>Nevertheless he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And with these words they scarcely restrained the people, that they not sacrifice unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>And [certain] Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew [him] out of the city, supposing he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and [to] Iconium and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>confirming the souls of the disciples [and] exhorting them to remain in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And having ordained elders for them in every church and having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>and from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And when they were come and had gathered the church together, they related what great things God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And there they abode [a] long time with the disciples.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>Then certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>And they, being accompanied by [some from] the church, passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and [by] the apostles and elders, and they declared all the things that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the apostles and elders came together to consider of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, Men [and] brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God chose that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as [he did] unto us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore why tempt ye God, putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>For we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what great miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, Men [and] brethren, hearken unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has declared how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>After this I will return and will restore the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will repair its ruins, and I will set it up again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>that the men that are left might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who does all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore my sentence is that those from among the Gentiles who are converted to God not be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and [from] fornication and [from] things strangled and [from] blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses of old time has in every city those that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, principal men among the brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>and they wrote [letters] by them after this manner: The apostles and elders and brethren [send] greeting unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>forasmuch as we have heard that certain [ones] who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised and keep the law, to whom we gave no [such] commandment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell [you] the same things by mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that ye abstain from foods offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>[which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching the word of the Lord and announcing the gospel, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord [and see] how they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul thought [it] not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>And the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other, and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>and Paul chose Silas and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>Then he came to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was faithful, but his father [was] a Gentile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>of whom the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium gave [good] witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul desired to have him go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those quarters, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they went through the cities, they asked them to keep the decrees that had been determined by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>And so the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Now passing through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision was shown to Paul in the night: There stood a man of Macedonia, asking him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, [and] a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on one of the sabbaths we went out of the city by a river side, where it was customary to pray; and we sat down and spoke unto the women who gathered [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>Then a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who feared God, heard [us], whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a Pythian spirit met us, which brought her masters much gain by divination:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>she followed Paul and us and cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce unto us the way of saving health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And she did this [for] many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas and drew [them] into the marketplace unto the rulers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and teach rites which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But at midnight as Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God, and the prisoners heard them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>then suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>Then he called for a light and came inside and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [their] stripes and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the keeper of the prison made these words known unto Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart and go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out in secret? no indeed; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the sergeants returned and told these words unto the magistrates; and they feared when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And they came and besought them, and bringing [them] out, asked [them] to depart out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And leaving the prison, they entered into [the house of] Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where the synagogue of the Jews was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>declaring openly and proposing that it behooved the Christ to have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the noble women not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the disobedient Jews, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And when they did not find them, they brought Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down have come here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received, and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And when they had taken security of Jason and of the others, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night unto Berea, who when they got [there] went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all diligence and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, also of honourable women who were Greeks and of men, not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>And then immediately the brethren sent Paul to go away towards the sea, but Silas and Timothy abode there still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens; and receiving an order from him unto Silas and Timothy to come unto him as soon as possible, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city completely given [over] to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>Therefore he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with those that he met with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? others, He seems to be a setter forth of new gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine [is], of which thou speakest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For thou bringest certain new things to our ears; we desire, therefore, to know what these things mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I passed by and beheld your sanctuaries, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God that made the world and all the things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>and has made of one blood all the lineage of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the seasons (which he has limited) and the bounds of their habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they should seek the Lord, if in any manner they might [reach out to] touch him and find him though he is not far from each one of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in him we live and move and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also of his lineage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being therefore of the lineage of God, we ought not to think that which is Divine is like unto gold or silver or stone, bearing the mark of art and man's imagination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>For the times of this ignorance God overlooked, but [he] now commands all men everywhere to repent</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he has ordained; [of whom] he has given assurance unto all [men] in that he has raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul departed from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But certain men believed and joined themselves with him, among whom [was] Dionysius of the Areopagus and a woman named Damaris and others with them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (for Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them and worked, for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was impressed by the Spirit and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And he departed from there and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Titus the Just, [one] that feared God, whose house was next to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>For I am with thee, and no one shall be able to hurt thee, for I have many people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgement seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This [fellow] persuades men to honor God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if it is a question of words and names and of your law, look ye [to it], for I will be no judge of such [matters].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from the judgement seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgement seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed from there into Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he came to Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem, but I will return again unto you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up [to Jerusalem] and after greeting the church, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, teaching only in the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard him, they took him unto [them] and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the exhorted brethren wrote the disciples to receive him, who, when he was come, was very helpful through grace unto those who had believed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for he mightily convinced the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard [this], they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And all the men were about twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And he went into the synagogue and spoke freely for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened and disobedient, but cursing the way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this continued by the space of two years so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>(And there were seven sons of [one] Sceva, a Jew [and] prince of the priests, who did so.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>In the same manner many who had practiced vain arts brought their books together and burned them before everyone, and they counted the price of them and found [it] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So the word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After these things were ended, Paul purposed by [the] Spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there, it behooves me to see Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And the same time there arose no small stir about the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said, Sirs, ye know that by this gain we have our wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And certain of the chief [persons] of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, asking [him] that he not present himself in the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused; and most of them did not know why they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defense unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>Then the [town] scribe, appeasing the people, said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that does not know how the city of the Ephesians is honored of the great goddess Diana and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For ye have brought here these men, who are neither [guilty of] sacrilege, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Therefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we are in danger of being accused of sedition for this day's uproar, there being no cause by which we may give an account of this concourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called the disciples and embraced [them] and departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with much word, he came into Greece</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and [there] abode three months. And when the Jews laid [in] wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he took counsel to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These going before tarried for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And the first of the sabbaths, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart the next day, and continued his word until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window, being fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paul went down and fell on him and, embracing [him], said, Trouble not yourselves, for his soul is [still] in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>When he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while, even until day break, thus he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they took the young man [home] alive and were greatly comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>And we went into the ship and sailed unto Assos, intending to take in Paul there, for so he had determined that he should go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And we sailed from there and came the next [day] over against Chios, and the next [day] we arrived in port at Samos; and having rested in Trogyllium, the next [day] we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, not to detain himself in Asia, for he hasted to keep the day of Pentecost, if it were possible for him, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility and with many tears and temptations, which have befallen me by the ambushes of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>[and] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying both to the Jews and also to the Gentiles, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now, behold, I go bound of the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that prisons and tribulations await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear unto myself, only that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Therefore I take you to record this day that I [am] pure from the blood of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not refrained from declaring unto you the full counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is powerful to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I have coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have showed you [in] all things how that so labouring, ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And when he had thus spoken, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>Then they all wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>sorrowing most of all for the word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And it came to pass that after we had left them and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the [day] following unto Rhodes, and from there unto Patara;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>and finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard and set forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>Now when we had sighted Cyprus, we left it on the left hand and sailed into Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And finding the disciples, we tarried there seven days, who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>And when we had accomplished those days, we departed; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, until [we were] out of the city; and we knelt down on the shore and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And when we had taken our leave one of another, we embarked [on the] ship, and they returned home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And when we had finished [our] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And the next [day] Paul and those of us that were with him departed and came unto Caesarea; and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was [one] of the seven, and abode with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>And he had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And as we tarried [there] many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle and shall deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we and those of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, Let the will of the Lord be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after those days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>There went with us also [certain] of the disciples of Caesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And the [day] following, Paul went in with us to [see] James, and all the elders were gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous of the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together, for they will hear that thou art come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men among us who have a vow on them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>them take, and purify thyself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave [their] heads, and all may know that those things, of which they were informed concerning thee, are nothing, but [that] thou thyself dost also walk orderly and keep the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>As touching the Gentiles who believe, we have written [and] concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from [things] offered to idols and from blood and from [that which has been] strangled and from fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men and the next day, purifying himself with them, entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until an offering should be offered for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews, who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and laid hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, Men of Israel, help; this is the man that teaches everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place and further brought Greeks also into the temple and has polluted this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For before [this] they had seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>So that all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the tribunal of the company that all Jerusalem was in an uproar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them; and when they saw the tribunal and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the tribunal came near and took him and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains and demanded [to know] who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers because of the violence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as Paul was to be led into the fortress, he said unto the tribunal, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar and led four thousand men out into the wilderness that were murderers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am certainly a Jew, a citizen of Tarsus, a city known in Cilicia; and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke unto [them] in the Hebrew tongue, saying,:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense [which I make] now unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence, and he said,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel [and] taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>As also the prince of the priests bears me witness, and all the estate of the elders, from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those who were bound there unto Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And it came to pass that, as I made my journey and was come near unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I Am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou dost persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And those that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of him that spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And when I could not see for the clarity of that light, being led by the hand of those that were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good witness of all the Jews who dwelt [there],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came unto me and stood and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee that thou should know his will and see that Just One and should hear the voice of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it came to pass that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a rapture of understanding</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw him saying unto me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and in every synagogue beat those that believed on thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of those that slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said unto me, Depart, for I will send thee far from here unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they gave him audience unto this word and [then] lifted up their voices and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they cried out and cast off [their] clothes and threw dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the tribunal commanded him to be brought into the fortress and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know why they cried out so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the tribunal, saying, Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the tribunal came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the tribunal answered, With a great sum I obtained this freedom. And Paul said, But I was [free] born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then straightway those who should have tormented him departed from him, and the tribunal was also afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>On the next day, because he wanted to know of certainty the cause for which he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands and commanded the princes of the priests and all their council to appear and brought Paul down and set him before them.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Then Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And the prince of the priests, Ananias, commanded those that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whitewashed wall, for dost thou sit to judge me after the law and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And those that stood by said, Dost thou revile God's high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the prince of the priests, for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, and of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there arose a great cry; and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees' part arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man, but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And when there arose a great dissension, the tribunal, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring [him] into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the night following the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou also bear witness at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together and they vowed under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they came to the princes of the priests and the elders and said, We have made a vow of anathema that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribunal that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though ye would enquire something more certain concerning him, and we, before he arrives, are ready to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>And when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered into the fortress and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him] and said, Bring this young man unto the tribunal, for he has a certain thing to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him and brought [him] to the tribunal and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him] and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who has something to say unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>Then the tribunal took him by the hand and went [with him] aside privately and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee that thou would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would enquire something more certain of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not believe them, for more than forty of them lie in wait [to ambush] him, who have vowed under a curse that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, looking for a promise from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the tribunal [then] let the young man depart and charged [him, See thou] tell no one that thou hast showed these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>and provide [them] beasts that they may set Paul on and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter after this manner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sends] greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was taken of the Jews and should have been killed by them; then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And when I desired to know the cause of why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was told me how the Jews lay [in] wait to [ambush] the man, I sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgement hall.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days Ananias, the prince of the priests, descended with the elders and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great peace and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy prudence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we accept [it] always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou would hear us of thy clemency a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow] and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world and prince of the seditious sect of the Nazarenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also has gone about to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But the tribunal Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>commanding his accusers to come unto thee; by examining of whom thou may take knowledge of all these things, of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>because thou art able to understand that there have been but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call [a] sect, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And for this reason do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and [toward] men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or else let these same [here] say if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>except it be for this one voice, that I cried out standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, saying, I shall have more information regarding [that] way, when Lysias the tribunal shall come down, [Then] I will know the uttermost of your matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his own to minister or come unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard of him the faith which is in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go away for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He hoped also that money should have been given him from Paul, that he might loose him; therefore he sent for him many times and communed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two years Felix received Porcius Festus as successor; and Felix, wanting to win the grace of the Jews, left Paul bound.:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the prince of the priests and the principals of the Jews informed him against Paul and besought him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking for grace against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, they placing an ambush in the way to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Let them, therefore, said he, who among you are able, go down with [me] and accuse this man, if there is anything in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And when he had tarried among them no more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea and the next day, sitting on the judgement seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he was come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar have I sinned [in] anything at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgement seat, where I ought to be judged; to the Jews I have done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there are none of these things of which these accuse me, no one may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the princes of the priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] vengeance against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before the one who is accused is face to face with his accusers and is given license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay on the next day I sat on the judgement seat and commanded the man to be brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And the next day when Agrippa was come and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the tribunals and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment, Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Then Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes [laid] against him.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>I esteem myself blessed, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee concerning all the things of which I am accused of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; therefore, I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>My manner of life from my youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation at Jerusalem, is known of all the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most perfect sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, constantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I verily had thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>Which things I also did in Jerusalem, and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the princes of the priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the princes of the priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? [It is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering thee from the people and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among those who are sanctified by the faith that is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but I announced first unto those of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of Judaea and [then] to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having, therefore, obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said should come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Christ should suffer [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto this people and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he spoke these things and [answered] for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth words of truth and temperance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows of these things, before whom I also speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, dost thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I desire before God that by little or by much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And when he had said these things, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and those that sat with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>But when it was determined that we should sail unto Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of the Augustus company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And entering into the ship, Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And the next [day] we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, and he put us in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and, passing it with difficulty, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens, near which was the city [of] Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, many were in agreement to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice [and] winter [there, which is] a port of Crete and lies toward Africa and the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, raising [sails], they sailed close by Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And when the ship was caught up [by it] and could not resist against the wind, [the ship] was taken by [the wind and] drifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into Syrtis, struck sail and so were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and the third [day] with our own hands we cast off the dead works of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>Then after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete to have avoided this harm and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of any person's life among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For the angel of God stood by me this night, whose I am and whom I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar; and, behold, God has given thee all those that sail with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>However we must be cast upon a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>and sounded and found [it] twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found [it] fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have waited and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I pray you to take [some] food, for this is for your [salvation and] health, for there shall not one hair fall from the head of any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took [some] food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were in all, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and cast out the grain into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they discovered a certain gulf with a shore, into which they decided, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, frustrated this counsel and commanded that those who could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea] and get to land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest, some on boards and some on [broken pieces] of the ship. And so it came to pass that they were all saved [by making it] to land.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And when they were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness; for they kindled a [great] fire and received all of us because of the present rain and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid [them] on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance does not suffer [him] to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>And he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they were waiting to see when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly; but after they had waited a great while and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>In the same quarters were possessions of a principal man of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and lodged us three days courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of dysentery, to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>So when this was done, others also, who had diseases in the island, came and were healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also honoured us with many gifts; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose ensign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>And having gone around, we came to Rhegium, and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where we found brethren, who asked us to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and The Three Taverns whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the principals of the Jews together, and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews spoke against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause therefore I have called for you, to see [you] and to speak with [you]: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came showed or spoke any harm of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him into [his] lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, procuring to persuade them of that concerning Jesus, the Christ, out of the law of Moses and [out of] the prophets, from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And when they did not agree among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken this word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and not perceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes and hear with [their] ears and understand with [their] heart and should be converted and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it known, therefore, unto you that this saving health of God is sent unto the Gentiles and [that] they will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had [a] great dispute among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all liberty, without hindrance.:</verse>
