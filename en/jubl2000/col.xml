      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the charity [which ye have] toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>for the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which ye have already heard by the word of the truth of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world, and brings forth fruit, as [it does] also in you, since the day ye heard [it] and knew the grace of God in truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also declared unto us your charity in [the] Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, asking that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that ye might walk worthy of the Lord, pleasing [him] in everything, being fruitful in every good work, and growing in the knowledge of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks unto the Father, who has made us worthy to participate in the inheritance of the saints in light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>for by him were all things created, that [are] in the heavens and that [are] in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they are] thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by him and in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fullness dwell</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his stake, whether [they are] the things in the earth or the things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you, that were in another time alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now he has reconciled [you]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreproveable in his sight</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and [are] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard [and] which is preached to every creature which is under heaven, of which I Paul am made a minister,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fulfill in my flesh that which [is] lacking of the tribulations of the Christ for his body's sake, which is the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I am made a minister by the dispensation of God which is given to me in you, to fulfil the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>[even] the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery in the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we preach, warning every man and teaching in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>In which I continue to labour, contending according to his operation, which he works in me mightily.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and [for] those at Laodicea and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in charity and in all [the] riches of the fulfilled understanding to know the mystery of the God and Father and of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>And this I say lest anyone should beguile you with enticing words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>Therefore in the manner in which ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, according to the elements of the world, and not after Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>buried together with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you, being dead in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>blotting out the bill of the decrees that was against us, which was contrary to us and took it out of the way, nailing it to his stake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>[and] having spoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no one therefore judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or of [the] new moon or of [the] sabbath [days],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one govern you according to their own will under [pretext of] humility and religion of angels, intruding into those things which they have not seen, vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding fast [to] the Head, from whom all the body, fed and united by its joints and bonds, grows in the increase of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>For if ye are dead with the Christ to the elements of the world, why, as though living unto the world, do ye decree rites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>touch not; taste not; handle not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>Which all perish with the using, because [they are] the commandments and doctrines of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body, but they have absolutely no value against the appetites of the flesh.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If ye then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where the Christ sits at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For ye are dead and your life is hid with the Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ, [who] is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil lust, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now let ye also put off all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Lie not one to another, putting off the old man with his deeds</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and [being] clothed with the new [man], who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one that created him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, servant [nor] free: but Christ [is] all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Clothed, therefore, (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) with bowels of mercies, with kindness, with humility, with meekness, with tolerance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>forbearing one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a quarrel against another: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, into which likewise ye are called into one body, and be ye thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of the Christ dwell in you in abundance in all wisdom, teaching you and exhorting you one to another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with grace singing in your hearts unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever ye do whether in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be subject to your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love [your] wives and do not be bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey [your] parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, provoke not your children lest they become disheartened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, in all things hearken unto [your] masters according to the flesh, not serving to be seen as those who [only] please men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he that does wrong shall receive the wrong which he has done, [now] that there is no respect of persons.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, do that which is just and right with [your] servants, knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Persevere in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>praying also together for us that God would open unto us [the] door of the word, to speak the mystery of the Christ, for which I am also in bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom towards outsiders, winning the occasion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your word [be] always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All my affairs shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your affairs and comfort your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all [the] things which [are happening] here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellowprisoner, salutes you, and Mark, nephew to Barnabas, (concerning whom ye have received commandments, if he comes unto you, receive him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only [are my] fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is [one] of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand [firm], perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I bear witness of him, that he has a great zeal for you and those [that are] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Salute the brethren who are in Laodicea and Nymphas and the church which is in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when [this] epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of [the] Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the [epistle] from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Take heed to fulfil the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace [be] with you. Amen.:</verse>
