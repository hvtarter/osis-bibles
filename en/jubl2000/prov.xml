        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive the chastening of prudence, justice, judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give prudence to the simple, and to the young men knowledge and council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>If the wise will hear [them], doctrine shall increase, and the man of understanding shall acquire wise counsel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand [a] parable and [the] interpretation; the words of the wise and their enigmas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge, [but] fools despise wisdom and chastening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hearken unto the chastening of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they [shall be] an increase of grace unto thy head and protection about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lay [in] wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol and whole as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all kinds of riches, we shall fill our houses with spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, do not walk in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet shall run to evil and make haste to shed blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lay [in]wait for their [own] blood; they ambush their [own] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So [are] the ways of every one that is greedy of gain [which] takes away the life of those who possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the entrance to the gates of the city she utters her words, [saying,]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one responded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>[for because] ye have disregarded all my counsel and rejected my reproof:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they shall call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the rest of the ignorant shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He keeps the person of the upright; [he is] a buckler to those that walk perfectly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>keeping the paths of judgment and the way of his merciful ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity, [yea], every good path.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil [and] delight in wicked perversion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>whose ways [are] crooked, and [they are] crooked in their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>to deliver thee from the strange woman, [even] from the stranger [who] flatters with her words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the prince of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>Therefore her house inclines unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go unto her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That thou may walk in the way of good [men] and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.:</verse>
