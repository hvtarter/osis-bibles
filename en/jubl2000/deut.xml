  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These [are] the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red [sea], between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>([There are] eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had commanded him regarding them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had slain Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>on this side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses resolved to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>turn and take your journey and go to the mount of the Amorite and unto all [the places] nearby, in the plain, in the hills, and in the valleys and to the Negev and by the sea side to the land of the Canaanite and unto Lebanon unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, [I] have given the land in your presence; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give unto them and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>the LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>Let the LORD God of your fathers add upon you a thousand times so many more as ye [are] and bless you, as he has promised!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can [I] myself alone bear your troubles and your burdens and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Give me from among you, of your tribes, wise and understanding and expert men, and I will make them the head [over you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the principals of your tribes, wise men and experts, and made them princes over you, princes over thousands and princes over hundreds and princes over fifties and princes over tens and officers among your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother and the stranger [that is] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>[Then I] said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorite, which the LORD our God gives unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the LORD thy God has given the land before thee; go up [and] possess [it], as the LORD God of thy fathers has said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And ye came near unto me every one of you and said, We will send men before us, and they shall spy us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the saying seemed good unto me, and I took twelve men of you, one of each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of Eshcol and spied out [the land].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought [it] down unto us and brought us word again and said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and ye murmured in your tents and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, This people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God who goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did with you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet with all this ye did not believe in the LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents, with fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and with a cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And the LORD heard the voice of your words and was angry and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has perfectly followed the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou shalt not go in there either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>[But] Joshua, the son of Nun, who stands before thee, he shall go in there; encourage him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey and your children who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there, and unto them will I give it, and they shall inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But [as for] you, return and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>[Then] ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God has commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Do not go up or fight, for I [am] not among you, lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke unto you, and ye would not hear but were rebels against the word of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorite, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] unto Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And ye returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD had said unto me; and we went around Mount Seir many days</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>until the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Ye have gone around this mountain long enough; return unto the Aquilon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the border of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you; take care unto yourselves, therefore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>do not seek a fight with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth because I have given Mount Seir unto Esau [for] an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Ye shall buy food from them for money that ye may eat, and ye shall also buy water from them for money that ye may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD thy God has blessed thee in all the works of thy hand; he knows thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years the LORD thy God [has been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we passed by our brethren, the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession because I have given Ar unto the sons of Lot [for] an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many and tall as the Anakims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>which also were accounted giants as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime, but the sons of Esau inherited from them, and they destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, [said I], and pass the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the days in which we came from Kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty-eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the camp, as the LORD swore unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the camp until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou art to pass the border of Moab today unto Ar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>and [when] thou comest near over against the sons of Ammon, do not distress them nor meddle with them, for I will not give thee of the land of the sons of Ammon [any] possession because I have given it unto the sons of Lot [for] an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also was accounted a land of giants; giants dwelt therein in another time, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great and many and tall as the Anakims; whom the LORD destroyed before the Ammonites; and they inherited from them and dwelt in their stead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did to the sons of Esau who dwelt in Seir when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they inherited from them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim, [even] unto Gaza, the Caphtorims, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass the river Arnon; behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land; begin, take possession and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day I will begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples [that are under] the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent ambassadors out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the high way; I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; I will only pass through on my feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>(as the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, who dwell in Ar, did unto me) until I shall pass the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him, for the LORD thy God had hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as [until] this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee; begin, take possession that thou may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>But the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him and his sons and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed all the cities, the men and the women and the little ones; we left none to remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>We took only the beasts for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which [is] by the brink of the river of Arnon, and [from] the city that is by the river even unto Gilead, there was not one city escaped us; the LORD our God delivered all of them before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only unto the land of the sons of Ammon thou camest not, [nor] unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto any place that the LORD our God forbade us.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into thy hand, and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the LORD our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars besides a great many unwalled towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women, and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the beasts and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we [also] took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] on this side of the Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto Mount Hermon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion and the Amorites call it Shenir) [and]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og, king of Bashan, had remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits [was] the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, [which] we inherited at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, and half of mount Gilead and the cities thereof, I gave unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Gilead and all Bashan ([fertile ground]), [being] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh: all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the country of Argob unto the border of Geshuri and Maachathi and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon, half the valley for a border even unto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the sons of Ammon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the plain also and the Jordan and the border [thereof] from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass armed before your brethren, the sons of Israel, all [that are] valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>Only your wives and your little ones and your livestock (for I know that ye have much livestock) shall abide in your cities which I have given you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until the LORD has given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and [until] they also inherit the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan; [then] shall ye return each man unto his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I also commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings, so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms where thou passest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Ye shall not fear them, for the LORD your God, he shall fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy mighty acts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I pray thee, let me go over and see that good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and would not hear me, and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Climb up into the top of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and towards the Aquilon and towards the Negev and eastward and behold [it] with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua and encourage him and comfort him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now, therefore, hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rights which I teach you, for [in] doing them ye shall live and go in and inherit the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Understand, therefore, that the LORD thy God does not give thee this good land [to] inherit because of thy righteousness, for thou [art] a stiffnecked people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire and stamped it [and] ground [it] very small [even] until it was as small as dust, and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>[Also] at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</verse>
