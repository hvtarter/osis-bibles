      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The LORD has been sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Turn unto me, said the LORD of the hosts, and I will turn unto you, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Do not be as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Turn now from your evil ways and [from] your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where [are] they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? Therefore they returned [from captivity] and said, Like as the LORD of the hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which [is] the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that [were] in the bottom; and behind him [there were] red horses, speckled, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then said I, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee who these [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These [are those] whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees and said, We have walked to and fro through the land, and, behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of the hosts, when wilt thou have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the LORD answered good words unto the angel that talked with me, words of consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of the hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very sore displeased with the Gentiles [that are] at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus hath the LORD said, I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in her, saith the LORD of the hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of the hosts, My cities through abundance of good shall yet be widened; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What [are] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the LORD showed me four carpenters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then I said, What [do] these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head, but these are come to cause them to tremble, to cut down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then I said, Where goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [is] its breadth and what [is] its length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and beasts in the midst of her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, [come forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD, for I have spread you abroad by the four winds of the heavens, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon, thou must escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; After the glory he shall send me unto the Gentiles which spoiled you, for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, behold, I raise my hand regarding them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants; and ye shall know that the LORD of the hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many Gentiles shall join themselves unto the LORD in that day and shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and then thou shalt know that the LORD of the hosts has sent me unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the LORD shall possess Judah his portion in the holy land and shall still choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD, for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD reprehend thee, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem reprehend thee; [is] not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And [the angel] answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I have caused thee to be clothed with new raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus saith the LORD of the hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also govern my house and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee [a] place among these that are here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee, for they [are] men of wonder. Behold, I bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone [there are] seven eyes; behold, I will engrave his labour, saith the LORD of the hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, saith the LORD of the hosts, each one of you shall call his neighbour under his vine and under [his] fig tree.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>and said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all [of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon the candlestick, and seven pipes for the lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>and two olive trees over it, one upon the right hand [side] of the bowl and the other upon the left hand [side] thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [is] this, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Dost thou not know what this is? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This [is the] word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who [art] thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel? [Thou shalt be reduced to] a plain; and he shall bring forth the headstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying], Grace, grace unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel shall lay the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of the hosts has sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who has despised the day of small [beginnings]? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. Those seven [are] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then I spoke and said unto him, What [are] these two olive trees upon the right hand [side] of the candlestick and upon the left hand [side] thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I spoke the second time and said unto him, What [are these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Dost thou not know what these [are]? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then he said, These two sons of oil [are] those that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>Then I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold a flying roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof [is] twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then said he unto me, This [is] the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for every one that steals (as it [is written] on one side of the [roll]) shall be destroyed; and every one that swears (as it [is written] on the other side of the [roll]) shall be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I brought it forth, said the LORD of the hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name; and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what [is] this that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What [is] it? And he said, This is an ephah [to measure wheat] that goes forth. He said moreover, This [is] their resemblance in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And, behold, they lifted up a talent of lead, and a woman was sitting in the midst of that ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This [is] wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind [was] in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then I said to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and those mountains [were] of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot [were] red horses and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What [is] this, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said unto me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>The one with the black horses went forth towards the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grisled went forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth, and he said, Go from here; walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then he called me and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, those that went toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of [those of that returned from] the captivity, [of the lineage] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whom are come from Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>Thou shalt take silver and gold and make crowns and set [them] upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>and speak unto him, saying, Thus spoke the LORD of the hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name [is] The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>He shall build the temple of the LORD, and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne, and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And Helem and Tobijah and Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah shall have crowns for [a] memorial in the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And those [that are] far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of the hosts has sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass if ye will obediently hear the voice of the LORD our God.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius [that] the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, [even] in Chisleu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech and their men, to pray before the LORD</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>[and] to speak unto the priests which [were] in the house of the LORD of the hosts and to the prophets, saying, Should we weep in the fifth month? Should we do abstinence as we have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then the word of the LORD of the hosts came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh [month], even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, [even] to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat [for yourselves], and drink [for yourselves]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Are these not the words which the LORD has published by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and quiet and the cities thereof round about her and [when] the south and the plain were inhabited?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion each one to his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>and do not oppress the widow nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>Yea, they made their hearts [as] an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the LORD of the hosts has sent by his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets; therefore came great wrath from the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>Therefore it is come to pass [that] as he cried and they would not hear, so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of the hosts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the Gentiles whom they did not know. Thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the desirable land desolate.:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>Again the word of the LORD of the hosts came [to me], saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus hath the LORD said, I will restore Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called City of truth and the mountain of the LORD of the hosts, the mountain of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Old men and old women shall yet dwell there in the streets of Jerusalem, and each one [with] his staff in his hand for the multitude of the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls who shall play in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus saith the LORD of the hosts, If this should appear difficult in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be difficult in my eyes? saith the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said; Behold, I will save my people of the land of the east and of the land where the sun sets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus hath the LORD of the hosts said, Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, from the day [that] the foundation of the house of the LORD of the hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither [was there any] peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men each one against his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I [will] not [do] unto the residue of this people as in the former days, said the LORD of the hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For the seed of peace [shall remain]; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass [that] as ye were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Judah and house of Israel; so will I save you that ye might be a blessing; fear not, [but] let your hands be strong.</verse>
