      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes who are in the dispersion: Health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into diverse trials;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>knowing that the proof of your faith works out patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>Let patience, therefore, have a perfect effect, that you may be perfect and complete, deficient in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you be deficient in wisdom, let him ask it of God: who gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not, and it shall be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, being not at all irresolute: for he who is irresolute, is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>Now let not that man think, that he shall receive anything from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A man of two minds, is unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Moreover, let the brother of humble condition glory in his exaltation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and the rich in his humiliation; for as a garden flower he shall pass away.-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rises with a burning heat, and withers the herb, and its flower falls down, and the beauty of its appearance perishes: so also shall the rich man fade in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man who sustains trial, for becoming an approved person, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one who is tempted say, Certainly I am tempted by God: for God is incapable of being tempted by evil things, and he tempts no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But every one is tempted, when he is drawn away, and enticed by his own lust:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>then lust having conceived, brings forth sin, and sin, being perfected, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Be not deceived, my beloved brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, descended from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of his own will, he begot us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>for the wrath of man works not out the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Wherefore, putting away all filthiness, and overflowing of maliciousness, embrace with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>And be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves by false reasoning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if any one be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man who views his natural face in a mirror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>for he who looks at himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But he who looks narrowly into the perfect law of liberty, and perseveres, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of its work, shall, in so doing, be happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any one among you think to be religious, who bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, the religion of this person is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure religion, and undefiled, with God, even the Father, is this: To take care of orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partial regard for persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if there enter into your synagogue a man having gold rings on his fingers, and with splendid clothing, and there enter likewise a poor man, with sordid apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you look on him who has the splendid clothing, and say, Sit you here honorably; and to the poor man, Stand you there; or, Sit here at my footstool:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>are you not, then, partial among yourselves, and have become judges who reason wickedly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken, beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor of the world-rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>Do not the rich exceedingly oppress you, and themselves drag you to the judgment seats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do not they defame that excellent name which is named on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>«If, now, indeed, you fulfill a royal law, according to the scripture,» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,' 'you do well.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you have respect of persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law of transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whoever will keep the whole law, yet fails in one point, has become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>«For he who said,» 'Do not commit adultery,' 'has also said, '«Do not kill.» 'Now if you do not commit adultery, yet if you kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak, and so do, as those who shall be judged by a law of liberty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>for judgment without mercy, will be to him who showed no mercy: but mercy exults over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What is the advantage, my brethren, if any one say he have faith, but have not works? Can faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>For if a brother or a sister be naked, or destitute of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and any one of you say to him, Depart in peace: be warmed, and be filled; yet give him none of the things needful for the body, what is the advantage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>So, also, faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>Also, one may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that there is one God; you do well: even the demons believe and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>Besides, would you know, O vain man, that faith, without works, is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works, when he had lifted up Isaac, his son, upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You see that his faith co-operated with his works, and by works his faith was perfected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>«And so that scripture was fulfilled, which says,» 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see, that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>And in like manner, also, was not Rahab, the harlot, justified by works, having secretly received the messengers, and having sent them away by another road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For, as the body, without the spirit, is dead, so, also, faith, without works, is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Do not become many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive a severe sentence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For in many things we all offend. If any one offend not in the word, he is a perfect man, able to rule, also, the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Behold, we put bits into the mouths of horses, to make them obedient to us, and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Behold, also, the ships, which, though they be so great, and are driven by fierce winds, are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the power of the pilot determines:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>so, also, the tongue is a little member, yet it works mightily. Behold, how much wood a little fire kindles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>Now the tongue is a fire-a world of iniquity; the tongue is so placed among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets the wheel of nature in a blaze, and is set on fire from hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>Now every species of wild beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of sea monsters, is subdued, and has been subdued by man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>but the tongue of men, no one can subdue; it is an unruly evil thing, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth proceed a blessing and a curse! My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does a fountain send forth, from the same opening, sweet water and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig-tree, my brethren, produces olives; or a vine, figs? So, no fountain can yield salt water and fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Is any one wise and intelligent among you? let him show, by good behavior, his works, with meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter anger and strife in your heart, do you not boast and lie against the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This is not the wisdom which comes from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>for where there is anger and strife, there is disorder, and every evil work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom from above is, indeed, first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be persuaded, full of compassion and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, by them who practice peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>Whence wars and fightings among you? Do they not come hence, even from your lusts, which war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You strongly desire, and have not; you kill, and are zealous, and can not obtain. You fight and war, but have not, because you ask not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask, and do not receive, because you ask wickedly, that you may spend upon your lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulterers, and adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity against God? Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world, is counted an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do you think that the scripture speaks in vain? And does the spirit, who dwells in us, strongly incline to envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>«But he gives greater favor. For it says,» 'God resists the proud, but gives favor to the humble.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Therefore, be subject to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you men of two minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be exceedingly afflicted, and mourn, and weep; and let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sadness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Be humble in the presence of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>He who speaks against his brother, and condemns his brother, speaks against the law, and condemns the law. But if you condemn the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy. Who are you, that condemn another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come, now, you who say, Today, or to-morrow, we will go to such a city, and will abide there one year, and traffic in merchandise, and get gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>who do not know what shall be to-morrow. For what is your life? It is, indeed, a smoke, which appears for a little while, and then vanishes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead of which, you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you boast in your proud speeches: all such boasting is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Wherefore, to him who know how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come, now, you rich men, weep, howl, on account of your miseries, which are coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches are putrefied, and your garments are motheaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver are eaten with rust, and the rust of them will be a witness against you, and will eat your flesh as fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Hark! the hire of the laborers who have reaped your field, which is fraudulently kept back by you, cries; and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have lived luxuriously on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts as in a day of festivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned-you have killed the Just One-he did not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Behold the husbandman, who expects the valuable fruit of the earth, waits patiently for it, till it receive the early and later rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be you also patient-strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Repine not against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned: behold, the Judge stands before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord: for an example of suffering evil, and of patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we call them happy, who are patient. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But, above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by the heaven, or by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yes, be Yes, and your no, No; that you may not fall under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray: is any one cheerful? let him sing psalms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any one sick, among you? let him send for the seniors of the congregation, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And the prayer of faith will save the sick person, and so the Lord will raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess your faults, one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The inwrought prayer of the righteous man avails much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elias was a man frail and mortal like us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the land brought forth its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brethren, if any one among you be seduced from the truth, and any one turn him back;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know what he who converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
