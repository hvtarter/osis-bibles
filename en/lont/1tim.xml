      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God, our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my own son in the faith: Favor, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I entreated you to continue in Ephesus, when going into Macedonia, that you may charge some not to teach differently,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor to give heed to fables, and endless genealogies, which occasion disputes rather than godly edification, which is through faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>(now the end of the charge is love, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and unfeigned faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which things some having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say, nor the things about which they are so positive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>We know, indeed, that the law is good, if one use it lawfully;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disorderly, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane; murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>fornicators, sodomites, manstealers, liars, false swearers, and if any other thing be opposite to wholesome doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I am entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>Now, I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has qualified me, that he reckoned me faithful, appointing me to the ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>who was formerly a defamer, and a persecutor, and an injurious person. But I received mercy, because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>and the favor of the Lord has superabounded, with the faith and love which is by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This saying is true, and worthy of all reception, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>However, for this cause I received mercy, that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them who should believe on him, in order to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God alone, be honor and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before you, concerning you, that we may carry on, through them, the good warfare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding fast faith and a good conscience; which some have put away, with respect to the faith, having made shipwreck:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to the adversary, that they might be taught by chastisement not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>Now I exhort, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings, and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who wills all men to be saved, and to come to an acknowledgment of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, -the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself a ransom for all; -of which the testimony is in its proper season:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>for which I was appointed a herald and an Apostle, (I speak the truth, I do not falsify,) a teacher to the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I will, therefore, that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>I like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but (which becomes women professing godliness,) with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all submission:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>for I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over a man, but to be silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>for Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>Besides, Adam was not deceived: but the woman, being deceived, was in transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>However, she shall be saved through child-bearing, if they live in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This saying is true. If one earnestly seek the office of a bishop, he desires an excellent work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>The bishop, then, must be unclaimed, the husband of one wife, vigilant, prudent, of comely behavior, hospitable, fit to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not given to wine, no striker, but gentle; not quarrelsome, nor a lover of money:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one who rules well his own house, having his children in subjection to him with all gravity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>for if one know not how to govern his own house; how shall he take care of the congregation of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>Not a new convert, lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover, he must even have a good report from those without, that he may not fall into reproach, and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>The deacons, in like manner, must be grave, not double-tongued, not giving themselves to much wine, not persons who earn money by base methods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding fast the secret of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>But let those also be first proved: then let them exercise the office of the deacon, being without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>The women, in like manner, must be grave, not slanderers; but vigilant, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling well their children and their families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they who have performed the office of a deacon well, procure to themselves an excellent degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But if I tarry long, that you may know you ought to behave yourselves in the house of God, which is the congregation of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And, confessedly, great is the secret of godliness; -he who has manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit; seen of messengers, proclaimed to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit expressly says, that in future times some will apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and to doctrines concerning demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>through the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>who forbid to marry, and command to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, who thoroughly know the truth;-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>that every creature of God is good, being received with thanksgiving, and nothing is to be rejected;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified, by the word of God, and by prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>Laying these things before the brethren, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of the faith, and of good doctrine, to the knowledge of which you have attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But reject profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself to godliness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>ford bodily exercise is profitable for little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the present life, and of that to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This saying is true, and worthy of all reception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>Besides, for this we both labor, and suffer reproach,- because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Those things give in charge, and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one despise your youth; but be a pattern to the believers in speech, in behavior, in love, in faith, in chastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, apply yourself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the spiritual gift which is in you, which was given you through prophecy, with the imposition of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Make these things your care. Be wholly employed in them, that your proficiency might be evident to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to yourself, and to your doctrine; continue in them; for in doing this, you will both save yourself, and them who hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not severely rebuke an old man, but beseech him as a father, and the young men as brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>the old women as mothers, and the young as sisters, with all chastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows; who are really widows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>but if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let these learn first piously to take care of their own family, and then to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she who is really a widow, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers, night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Now these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>For if any one provide not for his own, and especially those of his own family, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let not a widow be taken into the number under sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>eminent for good works-that she has brought up children, that she has lodged strangers, that she has washed the saints' feet, that she has relieved the afflicted, that she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But the younger widows reject; for when they become impatient of the restraint of Christ, they will wish to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>incurring blame for having violated their former engagement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And, at the same time, also, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers, also, and meddlers, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I would, therefore, have young widows to marry, to bear children, to govern the house, to give no occasion to the adversary for reproach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>for some are already turned aside after the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the congregation be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the seniors who preside well, be counted worthy of double honor; especially those who labor in word and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>«For the scripture says,'You shall not muzzle an ox treading out corn'; and, The laborer is worthy of his wages.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against a senior receive not an accusation, unless by two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who sin, rebuke before all, that the others, also, may be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you, in the presence of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Impose hands hastily on no one, neither partake of other men's sins. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer drink water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The sins of some men are very manifest, going before to condemnation; but some, indeed, they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In like manner, also, the good works of some are very manifest, and those that are otherwise, can not lie hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many servants as are under the yoke, esteem their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not defamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And let not those who have believing masters, not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them more, because they are believers, and beloved, who receive the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any one teach differently, and consent not to wholesome dictates of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is puffed up with pride, knowing nothing; but is doting about questions, and verbal contentions, from which come envy, strife, evil speakings, unjust suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>perverse disputings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth; who reckon gain to be godliness: from such, stand aloof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into the world, and it is evident that we can carry out nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>Wherefore, having food and raiment, with these let us be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they who will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is the root of all evil, which some, eagerly desiring, have wholly erred from the faith, and pierced themselves all around with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>Therefore, do you, O man of God! flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Combat the good combat of faith: lay hold on eternal life; to which, also, you have been called, and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you, in the presence of God, who makes all alive- and of Christ Jesus, who witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good confession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that you keep this commandment without spot, unblameable, till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which appearance, at the proper season, the blessed and only Potentate, the King of king, and Lord of lords will exhibit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who only has immortality-dwelling in light inaccessible; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and might everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge the rich in the present world not to be elated in mind, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who confers on us richly all things for enjoyment-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>to do good, to be rich in lovely works, ready to distribute, communicative,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>providing for themselves a good foundation for hereafter, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard the things committed to you in trust, avoiding profane babblings, and oppositions of knowledge, falsely so named:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some, professing, have erred, with respect to the faith. Favor be with you.</verse>
