      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, the brother, to the congregation of God which is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all consolation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all out affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the consolation with which they are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings for Christ abound in us, also, our consolation abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Now, whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort, and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effected by enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And out hope of you is steadfast, knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>Wherefore, brethren, we would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction, which happened to us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed above our strength, insomuch as we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Nay, more, we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you, also, laboring together in prayer for us, that the gift to us from many persons, may, by many, be acknowledged with thanksgiving for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For this is our glorying-the testimony of our conscience, that with godly simplicity and sincerity, (not with fleshly wisdom, but by the favor of God,) we have behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you than what you read, and also acknowledge; and I hope that you will acknowledge, even to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>seeing, indeed, you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this persuasions I purposed to come to you first, that you might have a second gift;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and from you to pass through into Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again to you, and by you to be sent forward into Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Having, then, purposed this, did I, indeed, use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh; so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is faithful, certainly our word, which was to you, was not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed to you by us, even by me and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not yes and no; but in him was yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>And whatever promises are of God, were through him yes, and through him amen, to the glory of God, by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now, he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who has anointed us, in God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who has also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover, I call on God as a witness against my soul, that to spare you, I have not as yet come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are joint promoters of your joy: for by the faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>Besides, I determined this with myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I should make you sorry, who then is he that could make me glad, unless the same who is made sorry by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>Wherefore, I wrote to you this very thing, that, coming, I might not have sorrow from them in whom I ought to rejoice; being firmly persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears; not that you might be made sorry, but that you might know the love which I have most abundantly toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now, if a certain person has grieved me, he has not grieved me except by a part of you, that I may not lay a load on you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that, on the other hand, you ought more willingly to forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up by excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore, I beseech you to confirm your love to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end, also, I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now, to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive: and even I, if I have now forgiven anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the person of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that we may not be overreached by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Moreover, when I came to Troas, in order to declare the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: therefore, bidding them farewell, I went away into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now, thanks be to God, who at all times causes us to triumph in Christ; and who, by us, diffuses the odor of the knowledge of him in every place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>for we are, through God, a fragrant odor of Christ, among the saved and among the destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To these, indeed, we are the odor of death, ending in death; but to the others, the odor of life, ending in life: and who is competent to these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>However, we are not like many who adulterate the word of God: but really from sincerity, yes, really from God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Must we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or letters of recommendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are out letter, written on our hearts, known and read of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>For you are plainly declared Christ's letter, ministered by us, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Now we have such confidence through Christ, toward God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are competent by ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves: but our competency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who has made us competent ministers of a new institution; not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills; but the spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>For if the ministration of death in letters engraved on stone was with glory, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how much rather shall not the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministration of condemnation was glorious, much more does the ministration of justification abound in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For, indeed, that which was glorified, was not glorified, in this respect, by reason of the transcendent glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is abolished was with glory, much more that which continues, is with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having, therefore, such confidence, we use great plainness of speech;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses, who put a vail upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>Indeed, their minds were blinded: for, till this day, the same vail remains in the reading of the Old Institution; it not being discovered that it is abolished in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>Moreover, till this day, when Moses is read, the vail lies upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken from around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now, the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord; are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Wherefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not falter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but have commanded away the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>If then, indeed, our gospel be veiled, it is veiled among the destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might shine into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>Now, we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants, for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are pressed on every side, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not utterly forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>At all times carrying about in the body, the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always exposed to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So that death works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>«Yet, having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written,'I believed, therefore I have spoken'; we, also, believe, and therefore speak;»</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will raise us up, also, by Jesus, and will present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all these things are for your sakes; that the favor which has abounded to many, may, through the thanksgiving of the greater number, redound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Wherefore, we do not faint; but, though, indeed, out outward man is impaired, yet the inward man is renewed, day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light afflictions work out for us an eternal weight of glory, great beyond expression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we are aiming, not at things seen, but at things unseen: for the things seen are temporal, but the things unseen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if the earthy house of this our tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, everlasting, in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For, indeed, in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be invested with our heavenly mansion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>And surely, being thus invested, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For, indeed, we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not that we desire to be divested, but invested: that mortality may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he who has wrought us up to this very desire, is God, who has also given us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>We are, therefore, always courageous; knowing that while at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(for we walk by faith, not by sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are courageous, indeed, and desirous rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore, also, we strive earnestly, whether at home, or from home, to be acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to what has been done, whether good or evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; and are made manifest to God: and, I trust, are made manifest also to your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>However, we do not again commend ourselves to you, but only give you occasion of boasting concerning us, that you may have an answer to them who boast in appearance, not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For, whether we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged thus- that if one has died, certainly all have died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and that he has died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who has died and rose again for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that we, from this time forth, respect no man on account of the flesh: and even if we have esteemed Christ on account of the flesh, yet now we esteem him no more on that account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>For, if any one be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all these things of God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us to the ministry of the reconciliation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>namely, that God was, by Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not counting to them their trespasses, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We, therefore, execute the office of ambassadors for Christ, as of God beseeching you by us; we pray you, in behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he has made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us; that we might become the justified of God, by him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We, then, as fellow-laborers, also beseech you not to receive the favor of God in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>«(for he says,» 'In an accepted season I have hearkened to you; and in a day of salvation I have helped you.' 'Behold, now is a highly accepted season; behold, now is a day of salvation:)'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>giving no cause of offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>But by everything approving ourselves as ministers of God, by much patience, by oppressions, by necessities, by distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>by stripes, by imprisonments, by tumults, by labors, by watchings, by fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by goodness, by a holy spirit, by love unfeigned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>by the word of truth, by the power of God, through the armor of righteousness of the right hand and of the left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through honor and dishonor, through bad fame and good fame; as deceivers, yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, yet well known; as dying, yet, behold, we live; as chastened, yet not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>Corinthians! our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now, in return, (I speak as to children,) be you also enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>what concord has Christ with Belial? or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>«And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said,» 'Assuredly I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Wherefore, come out from among them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch no unclean person; and I will receive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>«and I be to you a Father, and you shall be to me sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.»</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Wherefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit; perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us cordially. We have injured no one; we have corrupted no one; we have defrauded no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not this to condemn you; for I have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die and live with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my freedom of speech to you; great is my boasting concerning you: I am filled with consolation, I exceedingly abound in joy in all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh has no rest, but we were distressed on every side; without were fightings- within were fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless, God, who comforts them who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>(not, indeed, by his coming only; but more especially by the consolation with which he was comforted by you) -when he told us your earnest desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Therefore, though I made you sorry by the letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that letter, though suitable to the occasion, made you sorry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>I now rejoice; not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow produced reformation: for you were made to sorrow in a godly manner, that you might be injured by us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow produces a reformation to salvation, never to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>Behold, now, this very thing-your being made sorry with a godly sorrow-what carefulness it wrought in you; yes, what clearing of yourselves; yes, what indignation; yes, what fear; yes, what earnest desire; yes, what zeal; yes, what revenge! Upon the whole, you have showed yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>And, indeed, though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who did the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered it; but rather, that our care for you, in the presence of God might be manifested to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this reason, we were comforted in your comfort: yes, we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>That if I have boasted anything to him concerning you, I am not ashamed: for, as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so, also, our boasting to Titus is verified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, and how you received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the charity of God, which is given by the congregations of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their extreme poverty, superabounded to the riches of their liberality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>that to their power, (I bear witness,) yes, beyond their power, they were willing of themselves; with much entreaty</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>requesting us to accept the charity and the participation of the service, which is for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>Yes, beyond our expectations; for they first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>This moved us to entreat Titus, that as he had formerly begun, so he would also finish the same charity among you likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>Now as you abound in every gift, (in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,) I wish that you may abound in this gift also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not this as an injunction, but on account of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>(For you know the charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor; that you, through his poverty, might be rich.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give my opinion, not only to do, but also to be willing since the last year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>At present, therefore, finish the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will; so also let there be to finish, according to your ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be a willing mind, according to what a person has, he is accepted; and not according to what he has not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>However, I mean not that others should be eased and you distressed; but on account of equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>that now your abundance may be a supply for their want; that again, their abundance may be a supply for your want; that there may be an equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>«As it is written,» 'He who gathered much, had nothing over; and he who gathered little, had no lack.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>Now thanks be to God, who has put the same earnest care concerning you, into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he, indeed, received an exhortation; but from his great earnestness, was going to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And with him we have sent the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations our fellow-traveler, with this charity, which is ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord himself, and of your readiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>using this precaution, that none may blame us in the distribution of this abundance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>premeditating things comely, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes found diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, from the great confidence which he has in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow-laborer for you; or if our brethren be inquired of, they are Apostles of congregations, and a glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Wherefore, the proof of your love, and of our boasting concerning you, display before them, and before the face of the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>But, indeed, concerning the ministry which is for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your willingness: of which I boasted on your behalf, to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared since the last year; and your zeal has stirred up the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I have sent the brethren, that our boasting concerning you, may not be rendered false in this particular; but that as I said you may be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest, perhaps, if the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not you) should be put to shame by this confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore, I thought it necessary to entreat the brethren, that they would go before you, and complete beforehand your formerly announced bounty; that the same might be thus ready as a gift, and not as a thing extorted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>Now this I say, he who sows sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Every one according as he has purposed in his heart, ought to give; not with regret, nor by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make every blessing abound to you; that in everything, always having all sufficiency, you may abound in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>«As it is written,» 'He has dispersed, he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now, may he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the products of your righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>That you may be enriched in everything, for all liberality, which produces, through us, thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the ministry of this public service, not only fill us up completely the wants of the saints; but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>They, through the proof of the ministry, glorifying God for you avowed subjection to the gospel of Christ; and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and for their prayer for you, who ardently love you, on account of the exceeding favor of God bestowed on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Now, thanks to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now, I (the same Paul who, when present, indeed, am humble among you; but when absent, am bold toward you,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>beseech you, by the mildness and clemency of Christ. And I request that, when present I may not be bold with that confidence with which I conclude to be bold against some, who conclude us to be really persons who walk according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>(for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but exceeding powerful for the overturning of strongholds;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>overturning reasonings, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and leading captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and are prepared to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look on things according to appearance? If any one is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him, on the other hand, reason this from himself, that he is Christ's, so, also, are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>And, therefore, I should not be ashamed, if I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord has given us for your edification, and not for your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>(for his letters, says one, are indeed weighty and strong; but his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>let such a one conclude this, that such as we are in speech by letters, when absent, the same, also, when present, we will be in deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>But we dare not rank and compare ourselves with some who commend themselves: however, they, among themselves, measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>Further, we will not boast of things not measured according to the line of measure, which the God of measure has allotted to us, to reach even to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our line, as not reaching to you; (but we are come as far as to you also, in the gospel of Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>We do not boast of things not measured, that is, of other men's labors; but we have hope when your faith is increased, to be by you abundantly enlarged with respect to our line;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to declare the gospel in the regions beyond you; and not in another man's line, to boast of things already prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>He, then, who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved; but whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I wish you would bear with me a little in my foolishness: yes, indeed, bear with me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>for I am jealous of you with a godly jealousy; because I have espoused you to one husband, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I am afraid that, by some means, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For, if, indeed, he who has come preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached; or, if you receive another Spirit which you have not received; or another gospel which you have not embraced; you might justly bear with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I reckon myself to have come nothing short of the very chief of the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>And even though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge. But upon the whole, we have been made manifest to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Have I committed an offense in humbling myself that you might be exalted; because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other congregations, taking wages of them to do you service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>for being present with you, and in want, we were burdensome to no one; but what I wanted, the brethren from Macedonia supplied: and in everything I have kept, and will keep myself from being burdensome to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>Is the truth in me? then this my boasting shall not be prevented in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>For what reason? because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off opportunity from them who desire opportunity; that in what they boast, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false Apostles, deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore, it is no great wonder if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Moreover, I say, let no one think me a fool; but, if otherwise, at least, as a fool, bear with me, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak in this confident boasting, I do not speak according to the Lord; but as in foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For, being wise, you bear with fools cheerfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For if one enslave you, you bear it; if one devour you, if one take your goods, if one exalt himself, if one strike you on the face-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak of reproach, as, that we are weak. But, in whatever any one is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am above them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>of the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stone, thrice I was ship-wrecked: I have spent a night and a day in the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the heathens, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>In labor and toil; in watching often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Besides these troubles from without, that which is my daily pressure, the anxious care of all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must boast, I will boast of the things which relate to my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas, intending to apprehend me, guarded the city of the Damascenes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>but I was let down in a basket, through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>To boast, indeed, is not profitable to me; yet I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows:) such a one suddenly conveyed away to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>Indeed, I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was suddenly conveyed away into paradise, and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful for man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Concerning such a one I will boast; but concerning myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>Yet if I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think concerning me, above what he sees me to be, or what he hears from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>Indeed, that I might not be exalted above measure by the transcendency of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>But he said to me, My favor is sufficient for you, besides, my power is perfected in weakness: most gladly, therefore, I will boast rather of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Wherefore, I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses, for Christ's sake; because when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>Have I become a fool-? You have constrained me to it; for I ought to have been commended by you, because I am in nothing behind the very greatest Apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an Apostle were fully wrought among you with all patience, by signs and wonders, and powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is the thing in which you were inferior to other congregations, unless that I myself have not been burdensome to you? Forgive me this injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, a third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you; because I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>Yes, I most gladly will spend and be spent for the sake of your souls; even though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>Be it so, then, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>With respect to any one of them I sent to you, did I by him make gain of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I besought Titus to go to you; and with him I sent a brother: did Titus make any gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do you think that we apologize to you? In the presence of God we speak in Christ, that all these things, beloved, are done for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>Yet I am afraid, lest, perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish: and that I shall be found by you, such as you do not wish: -lest, perhaps, there be among you strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you; and I shall bewail many, who have formerly sinned, and have not reformed from the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>I am coming this third time to you: by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter shall be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have told you before, and now forewarn the second time, (as if present, though still absent,) those who have formerly sinned, and all others, that when I come again I will not spare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since you seek a proof of Christ speaking by me: (who is not weak toward you, but who is mighty among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>for though we was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God; and though we also are weak with him, yet we shall live with him, by the power of God toward you.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove yourselves: know you not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I trust that you shall know that we are not disapproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>However, I pray to God that you do no evil-not that we may appear approved; but that you may do what is good, though, indeed, we should be disapproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>Therefore we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong: and this, also, we pray for, even your perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>For this reason, being absent, I write these things, that, when present, I may not act sharply, according to the power which the Lord has give me for edification, and not for destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally, brethren, farewell: be perfect: comfort yourselves: mind the same thing: live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Salute one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</verse>
