      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians, which is in God, our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound to thank God always, concerning you, brethren, as it is fit, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves boast of you to the congregations of God, on account of your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions, which you endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>a proof of the righteous judgment of God, that you might be counted truly worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you thus suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>seeing it is just with God to return affliction to them who afflict you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to you, the afflicted, (because our testimony was believed by you,) rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>inflicting a just retribution on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>who shall suffer a just punishment-an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>in that day when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all the believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>In relation to which, we are always praying concerning you, that our God may account you worthy of this calling, and fill you with all the benevolence of goodness, and the effect of faith with power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the favor of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now, we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>that you be not suddenly shaken in mind, nor alarmed, neither by spirit, not by report, nor by letter, as from us, intimating that the day of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one lead you into a mistake by any means; because the apostasy must first appear, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, must be first revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself against every one called a god, or an object of worship; so that he places himself in the temple of God, openly exhibiting himself, that he is a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And you know what now prevents his being revealed until his proper time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For already the mystery of iniquity secretly works, only till he who now restrains, be taken out of the way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>and then shall that lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume by the spirit of his mouth-with the brightness of his coming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>he will, indeed, utterly destroy him, whose coming is according to the energy of Satan, with all the power, and signs, and wonders of falsehood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all the deceit of unrighteousness among the destroyed; because they did not embrace the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>For this cause, God will send them strong delusion, that they may believe a lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that all may be condemned who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has, from the beginning, chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of spirit, and belief of truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>to which he called you, by our gospel, that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Well, then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the traditions which you have been taught, whether by our word or letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through favor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rapidly spread, and be glorified, even as among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish and keep you from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>For we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do, and will do, the things which we command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now, we command you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which he received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us-that we did not walk disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>but with labor and toil we wrought night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we have not a right, but that we might give ourselves to you for a pattern, to imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>And, therefore, when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any one will not work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who still walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but prying into other people's affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now, them who are such, we command and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>And you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>Now, if one do not obey our command in this letter, point out that man, and keep no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>And may the Lord of peace himself give you peace always, in every event. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of Paul, with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: thus I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
