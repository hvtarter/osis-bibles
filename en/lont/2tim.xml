      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, on account of the promise of life, which is by Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my beloved son: Favor, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I give thanks to God, (whom from my forefathers I serve with a pure conscience,) that I have unceasing remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>remembering your tears, I greatly desire to see you, that I may be filled with joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>calling to remembrance also the unfeigned faith which is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that it dwells in you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause I put you in mind to stir up the spiritual gift of God, which is in you through the imposition of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice; but of power, and of love, and of self-government.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Wherefore, be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but jointly suffer evil for the gospel, according to the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, -not on account of our works; but on account of his own purpose and favor, which was given us through Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>and is now manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ; who has, indeed, vanquished death, and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>of which I am appointed a herald, and an Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>for which cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed; for I know in whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to preserve what I have committed in trust to him, till that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>The form of wholesome words, which you have heard from me, hold fast, with the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>The good deposit guard by the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>You know this, that all they who are in Asia have turned me off; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but being in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And how many services he rendered to me in Ephesus, you well know.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Therefore, my son, be strong in the favor which is through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And what things you have heard from me by many witnesses, these commit in trust to faithful men, who shall be fit also to teach others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Endure evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man who wars entangles himself with the occupations of this life, that he may please him, who has chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And also if one contend in the games, he is not crowned unless he contend according to the laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>It becomes the husbandman to labor, before he partakes of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say; and may the Lord give you understanding in all things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember, Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, has been raised from the dead, according to my gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>for which I suffer evil as a malefactor, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>For this cause I patiently bear all things on account of the elect; that they, indeed, may obtain the salvation which is by Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>This saying is true, that if we die with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we suffer patiently, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>Though we be unfaithful, he abides faithful; he can not deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Put them in remembrance of these things; earnestly testifying to them in the presence of the Lord, not to fight about words for nothing useful, but to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Strive to exhibit yourself to God an approved workman, irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But profane empty babblings resist, for they will increase to more ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And their word will eat as a gangrene: for whom are Hymeneus and Philetus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who, concerning the truth, have erred, affirming that the resurrection has already happened, and do subvert the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands firm, having this inscription, The Lord has made known them who are his:- and, Let every one who names the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But, in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earthenware; some to honor, and some to dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If, then, a man will cleanse himself well from these, he will be a vessel appointed to honor, sanctified, and very profitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee, therefore, youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with them who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>Moreover, foolish and ignorant questions reject, knowing that they beget contentions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>and the servant of the Lord must not be contentious, but gentle toward all men, fit to teach, patiently bearing evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in meekness instructing those who set themselves in opposition; if, by any means God will give them reformation to the acknowledgment of truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>This, also, know, that in latter days perilous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, proud, defamers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, bargain-breakers, slanderers, incontinent, fierce, haters of good men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it. Now, from these, turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>Of these, indeed, are they who go into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>always learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Now, in the manner that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men wholly corrupted in mind, reprobate as to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>However, they shall not proceed further; for their foolishness shall be very plain to all, as theirs also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But you have fully known my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, meekness, love, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, sufferings, such as befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra: such persecutions I endured; but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>And all, indeed, who will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall be persecuted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>but wicked men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>In the meantime, do you continue in the things which you have learned, and with which you have been entrusted, knowing from whom you have learned them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>and that, from a child, you have known the sacred scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All scripture, given by divine inspiration, is indeed profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>that the man of God may be perfect-completely fitted for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge you, in the presence of God, and of Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead, at his appearing in his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>proclaim the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For there will be a time when they will not endure wholesome doctrine; but, having itching ears, they will, according to their own lusts, heap up to themselves teachers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and they will, indeed, turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But do you watch at all times; bear evil treatment; do the work of an evangelist; fully perform your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am shortly to be sacrificed, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have continued faithful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will deliver to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them who love his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Make haste to come to me soon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas, having loved the present world, has forsaken me, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens into Galatia, and Titus into Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me in the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me many evil things; the Lord will reward him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom beware, for he has greatly opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first answer, no one appeared with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>However, the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me, the proclamation might be fully declared, and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus abode at Corinth; and Trophimus I left at Miletus, sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you; and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Favor be with you.</verse>
