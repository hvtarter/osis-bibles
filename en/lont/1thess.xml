      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God at all times for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>incessantly remembering your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God, even our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>for our gospel came not to you in word only, but also with power, and with the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance: as you know what sort of men we were among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having embraced the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that you become patterns to all who believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>Besides, from you the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and Achaia; but also in every place your faith in God is spread abroad, so that we have no need to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves publish concerning us, what sort of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he has raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance among you, that it was not in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>For although we had before suffered, and were shamefully handled, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold, through our God, to speak to you the gospel of God, amidst a great combat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>Besides, our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor with guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we were approved of God, to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither did we, at any time, use flattering words, or a pretext for covetousness; God is witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Neither sought we honor from men; neither from you, nor from others. We might have acted with authority, as Apostles of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>but we were gentle among you, as a nurse cherishes her children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but our own souls, also; because you were become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For your remember, brethren, our labor and toil; that laboring night and day; that we might not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You were witnesses, and God, also, in what a holy, and just, and blameless manner, we acted toward you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As, also, you know, how we addressed every one of you as a father his own children, exhorting and comforting you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and testifying that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>On this account, also, we give thanks to God, without ceasing, that when you received from us this message of God, you embraced not the word of men; but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which, indeed, works effectually in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brethren, became imitators of the congregations of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus; because you also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who both killed the Lord, and the prophets, and have greatly persecuted us, and do not please God, and are contrary to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>hindering us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved; so that they fill up their iniquities always: but the wrath of God is coming upon them at length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>Now, we, brethren, being separated from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, the more abundantly endeavored, with great desire, to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore, we would have come to you (even I, Paul,) once and again, but the adversary hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>You, indeed, are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore, no longer concealing our anxiety, we were well pleased to be left at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to exhort you concerning your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one should be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that we are appointed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we were to be afflicted; which also happened as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this reason also, no longer concealing my anxiety, I sent to know your faith; lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you, and our labor have become in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now, when Timothy came to us from you, and gave us the good news of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us at all times, ardently desiring to see us, even as we also to see you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>by this, brethren, we were comforted concerning you in all our affliction and necessity, even by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, when you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>But what thanksgiving can we return to God concerning you, for all the joy with which we rejoice, through you, in the presence of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day, most earnestly requesting to see your face, and to supply the deficiencies of your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may God himself, even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, make straight our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord fill you, and make you overflow with love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>that he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness, before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>As to what remains, then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and please God, you would more abound in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>for this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from whoredom-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that every one of you should know how to possess his own body in sanctification and honor-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man should go beyond bounds, or defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all such;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>for God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore, indeed, he who despises not man, but God, who certainly has given to us his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But, concerning brotherly love, you have no need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And, indeed, you do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we exhort you, brethren, still to abound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and earnestly study to be quiet; and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk decently toward them who are without, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them who sleep; that you may not be grieved, even as the others, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again; so, also, them who sleep, will God, through Jesus, bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>Besides, this we affirm to you, by the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain at the coming of the Lord, shall not anticipate them who are asleep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>for the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>afterward we, the living, who remain, shall, at the same time with them, be instantly taken up in clouds, to join the Lord in the air; and so we shall be for ever with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>However, concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should come upon you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not sons of night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore, let us not sleep, even as others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they who sleep, sleep in the night; and they who get drunk, get drunk in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God has appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we may live together, with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Wherefore, comfort one another, and edify each other, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore, comfort one another, and edify each other, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now, we beseech you, brethren, to acknowledge them who labor among you, and who preside over you in the Lord, and instruct you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very highly in love for their works' sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Moreover, we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be of a long-suffering disposition toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>Take care that no one return evil for evil to any one, but always pursue what is good, both toward one another and toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God, by Christ Jesus, concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And may the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your whole person, the spirit, and the soul, and the body, be preserved unblameable, till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he who has called you; who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I solemnly charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
