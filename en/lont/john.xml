      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him, and without him not a single creature was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shone in darkness, but the darkness received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>A man named John, was sent from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This man came as a witness, to testify concerning the light, that through him, all might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not himself the light; but came to testify concerning the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightens every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own land, and his own people did not receive him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>but to as many as received him, believing in his name, he granted the privilege of being children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became incarnate, and sojourned amongst us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of favor and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(It was concerning him John testified, when he cried, This is He of whom I said, He that comes after me, is preferred to me; for he was before me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>Of his fulness we all have received, even favor for favor's sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>for the law was given by Moses-the favor and the truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one ever saw God; it is the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, who has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>he acknowledged, and denied not, but acknowledged, saying, I am not the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, Who, then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said, Tell, then, who you are, that we may return an answer to them who sent us. What do you say of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>«He answered, I am he whose voice proclaims in the wilderness,» 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' 'as said, the Prophet Isaiah.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they questioned him further, Why, then, do you immerse, if you be not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered, I immerse in water, but there is one among you whom you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>It is he who comes after me, and was before me; whose shoe-string I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened at Bethabara, upon the Jordan, where John was immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the next day, John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is He, concerning whom I said, After me a man comes, who is preferred to me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>As for me, I knew him not; but, that he might be made manifest to Israel, I am come immersing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John testified further, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven, like a dove, and remaining upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>For my part, I should not have known him, had not He, who sent me to immerse in water, told me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining, the same is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>Having, therefore, seen this, I testify that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day, John, being with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>observed Jesus passing, and said, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples hearing this, followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus turning about, saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They answered, Rabbi, (which signifies Teacher,) where do you dwell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He replied, Come, and see. They went, and saw where he dwelt, and it being about the tenth hour, abode with him that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two, who, having heard John, followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>The first he met, was his own brother, Simon; to whom he said, We have found the Messiah, (a name equivalent to Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, looking upon him, said, You are Simon, the son of Jona; you shall be called Cephas, (which denotes the same as Peter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day, he resolved to go to Galilee, and meeting Philip, said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip meets Nathanael, and says to him, We have found the person described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathanael says to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip answered, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, concerning him, Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael replying, said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered him, saying, Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>He added, Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Three days after, there was a marriage in Cana, of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus, also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>The wine falling short, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus answered, Woman, what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six water pots of stone, containing two or three baths each, placed there for the Jewish rites of cleansing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, Fill the pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then he said, Draw, now, and carry to the director of the feast. And they did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the director of the feast had tasted the wine made of water, not knowing whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>he said, addressing the bridegroom, Every person presents the best wine first, and worse wine afterward, when the guests have drunk largely; but you have reserved the best till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This first miracle Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, displaying his glory: and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>Afterward, he went to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; but they staid not there many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Jewish passover being nigh, Jesus went to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and finding changers sitting in the temple, and people who sold cattle and sheep, and doves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and cattle, scattering the coin of the changers, and oversetting their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and he said to them, who sold doves, Take these things hence. Make not my Father's house a house of traffic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>«(Then his disciples remembered these words of the scripture,'My zeal for thy house consumes me.')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Therefore, the Jews answered, and said to him, By what miracle do you show us your title to do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answering, said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will rear it again in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews replied, Forty and six years was this temple in building; and you would rear it in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>(But, by the temple, he meant his body.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When, therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they understood the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>While he was at Jerusalem, during the feast of the passover, many believed on him, when they saw the miracles which he performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself with them, because he knew them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>He needed not to receive from others a character of any man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a Pharisee called Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>who came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles which you do, unless God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answering, said to him, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not discern the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus replied, How can a grown man be born? Can he enter his mother's womb anew, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born of water and Spirit, he can not enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Wonder not, then, that I have said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear the report of him, but know not whence he comes, or whither he goes; so is every one who is born of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus replied, Are you the teacher of Israel, and know not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet you receive not our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If you understood not, when I told you earthly things, how will you understand when I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>For none has ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven; the Son of Man, whose abode is heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>As Moses placed on high the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be placed on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but obtain eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>for God has so loved the world, as to give his own begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him, may not perish, but obtain eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God has sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world may be saved by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes on him shall not be condemned; he who believes not, is already condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>Now this is the ground of condemnation; that light has come into the world, and men have preferred the darkness to the light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For whosoever does evil, hates the light, and shuns it, lest his deeds should be detected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who obeys the truth, comes to the light, that it may be manifest that his actions are agreeable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus went, with his disciples, into the territory of Judea, where he remained with them, and immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John also was immersing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came thither, and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Now John's disciples had a dispute with a Jew, about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>Then they went to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you near the Jordan, of whom you gave so great a character; he, too, immerses, and the people flock to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, A man can have no power but what he derives from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves are witness for me, that I said, I am not the Messiah; but am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The bridegroom is he who has the bride; but the friend of the bridegroom, who assists him, rejoices to hear the bridegroom's voice: this, my joy, therefore, is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, while I decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above, is above all. He who is from the earth is earthly, and speaks as being from the earth. He who comes from heaven, is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he testifies, is what he has seen and heard; yet his testimony is not received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who receives his testimony, vouches the veracity of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>for he whom God has commissioned, relates God's own words; for to him God gives not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has subjected all things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes on the Son, has life eternal; he who rejects the Son, shall not see life: but the vengeance of God awaits him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Jesus, knowing that the Pharisees were informed that he made and immersed more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who immersed,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>left Judea, and returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Being obliged to pass through Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>he came to a Samaritan city, called Sychar, near the heritage which Jacob gave his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. And Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat down by the well, it being about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria, having come to draw water, Jesus said to her, Give me some drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(for his disciples were gone into the city to buy food;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>the Samaritan woman answered, How is it, that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan? (For the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus replied, If you knew the bounty of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me some drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>She answered, Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep: whence, then, have you the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus replied, Whosoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whosoever will drink of the water which I shall give him, will never thirst more; but the water which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain, springing up to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman answered, Sir, give me this water, that I may never be thirsty, nor come hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>She answered, I have no husband. Jesus replied, You say well, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have, is not your husband. In this, you have spoken truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place, where me ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus answered, Woman, believe me, the time approaches when you shall neither come to this mountain, nor go to Jerusalem, to worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you know not, we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the time comes, or, rather, is come, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such are the worshipers whom the Father requires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman replied, I know that the Messiah comes, (that is, Christ;) when he is come, he will teach us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, I who speak to you, am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Upon this, his disciples came, and wondered that he talked with a woman; yet none of them said, What do you seek? or, Why do you talk with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>Then the woman left her pitcher, and having gone into the city, said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is this not the Messiah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They, accordingly, went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile, the disciples entreating him, said, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>He answered, I have food to eat which you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Then said his disciples, one to another, Has any man brought him food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus answered, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, After four months comes harvest? But I say, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields; for they are already white enough for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The reaper receives wages, and gathers the fruits of eternal life, that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this, the proverb is verified, One sows, and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that on which you have bestowed no labor: others labored, and you get possession of their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now, many Samaritans of that city believed him, on the testimony of the woman, who said, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>When, therefore, they came to him, they besought him to stay with them; and he staid there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed, because of what they heard from himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, It is not, now, on account of what you have reported, that we believe; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days, Jesus departed, and went to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for he had himself declared that a prophet is not regarded in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Being come into Galilee, he was well received by the Galileans, who had seen all that he did at Jerusalem, during the festival; for they likewise attended the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Then Jesus returned to Cana, of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain officer of the court, whose son lay sick at Capernaum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>who having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and entreated him to come and cure his son, who was dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and prodigies, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The officer answered, Come, Sir, before my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus replied, Go your way. Your son is well. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>As he was returning, his servants met him, and informed him that his son was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>He then inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They answered, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Then the father knew, that it was the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son is well; and he, and all his family, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This second miracle Jesus performed, after returning from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>Afterward there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is at Jerusalem, nigh the sheep gate, a bath, called, in Hebrew, Bethesda, which has five covered walks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great number of sick, blind, lame, and palsied people, waiting for the moving of the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>(for a messenger at times descended into the bath, and agitated the water; and the first that stepped in, after the agitation of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>Now, there was one there, who had been diseased thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus, who saw him lying, and knew that he had been long ill, said to him, Do you desire to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The diseased man answered, Sir, I have no person to put me into the bath, when the water is agitated; but while I am going, another gets down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>Instantly the man was healed, and took up his couch and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Now, that day was the Sabbath. The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured, This is the Sabbath. It is now lawful for you to carry the couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered, He who healed me, said to me, Take up your couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him then, Who is the man that said to you, Take up your couch and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that had been healed, knew who it was; for Jesus had slipped away, there being a crowd in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Jesus, afterward, finding him in the temple, said to him, Behold, you are cured; sin no more, lest something worse befall you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>Therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done this on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now; I also work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this reason the Jews were the more intent to kill him; because he had not only broken the Sabbath, but, by calling God his real Father, had equaled himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus addressed them, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but as he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, such does the Son, likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself does: nay, and will show him greater works than these, which will astonish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises and quickens the dead, the Son also quickens whom he will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>for the Father judges no person, having committed the power of judging entirely to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all might honor the Son; as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father, who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears my doctrine, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not suffer condemnation, having passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Most assuredly, I say to you, the time comes; or, rather, is come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and hearing, they shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For, as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son, to have life in himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given him even the judicial authority, because he is a Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Wonder not at this: for the time comes when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth. They who have done good, shall arise to enjoy life; they who have done evil, shall arise to suffer punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not to please myself, but to please him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I alone testify concerning myself, my testimony is not to be regarded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>there is another who testifies concerning me; and I know that his testimony of me ought to be regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You, yourselves, sent to John, and he bore testimony of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>As for me, I need no human testimony; I can only urge this for your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the blazing and shining lamp; and for awhile, you were glad to enjoy his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater testimony than John's: for the works which the Father has empowered me to perform, the works themselves, which I do, testify for me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>Nay, the Father, who sent me, has himself attested me. Did you never hear his voice, or see his form?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>Or, have you forgotten his declaration, that you believe not him whom he has sent forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the scriptures because you think to obtain by them eternal life. Now these, also, are witnesses for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>yet you will not come to me, that you may obtain life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I desire not honor from men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you, that you are strangers to the love of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in my Father's name, and you did not receive me; if another come, in his own name, you will receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, while you court honor one from another, regardless of the honor which comes from God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I am he who will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you confide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me: for he wrote concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>Afterward, Jesus crossed the sea of Galilee, also called of Tiberias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>and a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miraculous cures which he had performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up on a mountain; where he sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the passover, the Jewish festival, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and perceiving that a great multitude was flocking to him, said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread to feed these people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(This he said to try him; for he knew himself, what he was to do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered, Two hundred denarii would not purchase bread enough to afford every one a morsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>Here is a boy who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Make the men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So they reclined; in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to those who had reclined. He gave them also of the fishes, as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they had eat sufficiently, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They, therefore, gathered, and with the fragments which the people had left of the five barley loaves, they filled twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When those men had seen the miracle which Jesus had wrought they said, This is certainly the prophet who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Then Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and carry him off, to make him king, withdrew again, alone, to the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>In the evening, his disciples went to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and having embarked, were passing by sea to Capernaum. It was now dark; and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the water was raised by a tempestuous wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observed Jesus walking on the sea, very near the bark, and were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them, It is I, be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they gladly received him into the bark; and the bark was immediately at the place whither they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, the people who were on the seaside, knowing that there had been but one boat there, and that Jesus went not into the boat with his disciples, who went alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(other boats, however, arrived from Tiberias, nigh the place where they had eat, after the Lord had given thanks;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>knowing, besides, that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, embarked, and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>Having found him on the opposite shore, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw miracles, but because you eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures through eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for to him the Father, that is, God, has given his attestation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They asked him, therefore, What are the works which God requires us to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered, This is the work which God requires-- that you believe on him whom he has sent forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They replied, What miracles, then, do you, that seeing it, we may believe you? What do you perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>«Our fathers eat the manna in the desert; as it is written,» 'He gave them bread of heaven to eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus then said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread of heaven: but my Father gives you the true bread of heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>for the bread of God is that which descends from heaven, and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said, therefore, to him, Master, give us always this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus answered, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me, shall never hunger; and he who believes on me, shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But, as I told you, though you have seen me, you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All the Father gives me, will come to me; and him who comes to me, I will not reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I descended from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>Now, this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none of all he has given me, but raise the whole again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>This is the will of him who sent me, that whoever recognizes the Son, and believes on him, should obtain eternal life, and that I should raise him again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which descended from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I descended from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered, Murmur not amongst yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>no man can come to me, unless the Father, who has sent me, draw him; and him I will raise again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>«It is written in the prophets,» 'They shall be taught of God.' 'Every one who has heard, and learned from the Father, comes to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man, except him who is from God, has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers eat the manna in the desert, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>Behold the bread which descended from heaven, that whosoever eats of it may not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread, which descended from heaven. Whosoever eats of this bread, shall live forever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him again at the last day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>for my flesh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I abide in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the Father lives, who sent me; and I live by the Father; even so he, who feeds on me, shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which descended from heaven. It is not like what your fathers eat, for they died: he that eats this bread, shall live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>This discourse he spoke in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples having heard it, said, This is hard doctrine; who can understand it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What if you should see the Son of Man reascending thither, where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing. The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was that would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>He added, Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this time, many of his disciples withdrew, and accompanied him no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered, Master, to whom should we go? You have the words of eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>and we believe, and know that you are the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve? yet one of you is a spy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He meant Judas Iscariot, son of Simon; for it was he who was to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he would not reside in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now, the Jewish feast of tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers, therefore, said to him, Leave this country, and go to Judea, that your disciples may also see the works which you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For whoever courts renown, does nothing in secret: since you perform such things, show yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For not even his brothers believed on him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus answered, My time is not yet come; any time will suit you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I disclose the wickedness of its actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go you to this festival: I go not thither, because it is not my time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when his brothers were gone, he also went to the festival; not publicly, but rather privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>At the festival, the Jews inquired after him, and said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others, No; he seduces the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>No person, however, spoke freely of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>About the middle of the festival, Jesus went into the temple, and was teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews said with astonishment, Whence comes this man's learning, who was never taught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus made answer, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any one will do his will, he shall discern whether my doctrine proceeds from God, or from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>Whosoever teaches what proceeds from himself, seeks to promote his own glory: whosoever seeks to promote the glory of him who sent him, deserves credit, and is a stranger to deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered, You are possessed. Who seeks to kill you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus replied, I have performed one action, which surprises you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses instituted circumcision among you, (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and you circumcise on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If, on the Sabbath, a man receive circumcision, that the law of Moses may not be violated; are you incensed against me, because, on the Sabbath, I have cured a man, whose whole body was disabled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Judge not from personal regards, but judge according to justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem, said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>Lo! he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers, indeed, acknowledge that this is the Messiah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>But we know whence this man is; whereas, when the Messiah shall come, no person will know whence he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus, who was then teaching in the temple, cried, Do you know both who, and whence I am? I came not of myself. But he is true, who sent me, whom you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>As for me, I know him, because I came from him, and am commissioned by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they sought to apprehend him, but none laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>Many of the people, however, believed on him, and said, When the Messiah shall come, will he do more miracles than this man does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>When the Pharisees heard that the people muttered such things concerning him, they and the chief priests dispatched officers to seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus, therefore, said, Yet a little while I remain with you; then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You shall seek me, but shall not find me; nor be able to come where I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said, among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean, by saying, You shall seek me, but shall not find me, nor be able to get thither, where I shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last, and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes on me, as the scripture says, shall be like a cistern, whence rivers of living waters shall flow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>This he spoke of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Many of the people having heard what was spoken, said, This is certainly the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Some said, This is the Messiah. Others, does the Messiah come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Does not the scripture say, that the Messiah will be of the posterity of David, and come from Bethlehem, the village whence David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>Thus the people were divided concerning him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>and some of them would have seized him, but no person laid hands upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Wherefore have you not brought him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees replied, Are you also seduced?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Has any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this populace, which knows not the law, is accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, one of themselves, (he who came to Jesus by night,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>said to them, Does our law permit us to condemn a man, without hearing him, and knowing what he has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered him, Are you also a Galilean? Search, and you will find that prophets arise not out of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then every man went to his own house;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early in the morning he returned to the temple, and all the people having come to him, he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>Then the Scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman, taken in adultery; and having placed her in the middle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>said to him, Rabbi, this woman was surprised in the act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses has commanded in the law, that such should be stoned; and what do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to try him, that they might have matter for accusing him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing with his finger, upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>As they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, Let him who is sinless, amongst you, throw the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>Again, having stooped down, he wrote upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>They, hearing that, withdrew, one after another, the eldest first, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus, raising himself, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those, your accusers? Has no person passed sentence on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She answered, No person, Sir. Jesus said to her, Neither do I pass sentence on you. Go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Again Jesus addressed the people, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore retorted, You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not to be regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered, Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony ought to be regarded; because I know whence I came, and whither I go. As for you, you know not whence I came, and whither I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge from passion; I judge no person:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>and if I do, my judgment ought to be regarded, for I am not alone, but concur with the Father, who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>It is a maxim in your law, that the concurrent testimony of two is credible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>Now I am one who testify concerning myself; the Father that sent me is another that testifies of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they asked him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me nor my Father: if you knew me, you would know my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These things he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple, and no person seized him, his hour not being yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Again, Jesus said to them, I am going away; you will seek me, and shall die in your sins; whither I go, you can not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself, that he says, Whither I go, you can not come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>therefore I said, You shall die in your sins; for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They, therefore, asked him, Who are you? Jesus answered, The same that I told you formerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say of you, and to reprove in you: but he who sent me is worthy of belief; and I do but publish to the world what I have learned from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not perceive, that he meant the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, When you shall have raised the Son of Man on high, then you shall know what I am; and that I do nothing of myself, and say nothing which the Father has not taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>While he spoke thus, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus, therefore, said to those Jews who believed on him, If you persevere in my doctrine, you are my disciples indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>Some made answer, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never enslaved to any man. How do you say, You shall be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus replied, Most assuredly, I say to you, whosoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>Now the slave abides not in the family perpetually, the Son abides perpetually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If, therefore, the Son make you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are Abraham's offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my doctrine has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak what I have seen with my Father: and you do what you have learned from your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered, Abraham is our Father. Jesus replied, If you were Abraham's children, you would act as Abraham acted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I received from God. Abraham acted not thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do the deeds of your father. They answered, We were not born of fornication, We have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus replied, If God were your Father, you would love me; for I proceeded, and am come from God. I came not of myself. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand my language? It is because you can not bear my doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>The devil is your father, and the desires of your father you will gratify: he was a manslayer from the beginning; he swerved from the truth, because there was no veracity in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks suitably to his character; for he is a liar, and the father of lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>As for me, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Who of you convicts me of falsehood? And if I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God, regards God's words. You regard them not, because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews then answered, Have we not reason to say, You are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus replied, I have not a demon: but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>As for me, I seek not to promote my own glory; another seeks it, who judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever keeps my word, shall never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The Jews then said to him, Now we are certain that you have a demon: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; yet you say, Whoever keeps my word, shall never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our Father Abraham, who is dead. The prophets also are dead: whom do you make yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I commend myself, my commendation is nothing: it is my Father, whom you call your God, who commends me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Nevertheless, you know him not; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should speak falsely like you: but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he should see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews replied, You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they took up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As Jesus passed along, he saw a man who had been born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned: this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned. It was only that the works of God might be displayed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>I must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>Having said this, he spit upon the ground, and with the clay, which he made with the spittle, anointed the blind man's eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>and said to him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies Sent.) He went, therefore, and washed them, and returned seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Then the neighbors, and they who had before seen him blind, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, It is he; others, He is like him. He said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They asked him, then, How did you receive your sight?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered, A man called Jesus, made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash your eyes. I went accordingly, and washed them, and saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Then they asked him, Where is he? He answered, I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>Then they brought him, who had been blind, to the Pharisees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>(now it was on a Sabbath, that Jesus made the clay, and gave him his sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>The Pharisees likewise, therefore, asked him how he had received his sight. He answered, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Upon this some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, for he observes not the Sabbath. Others said, How can one that is a sinner perform such miracles? And they were divided among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>Again they asked the man, who had been blind, What do you say of him, for giving you sight? He answered, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the Jews believed not that the man had been blind, and had received his sight; till they called his parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and asked them, Do you say, that this is your son, who was born blind? How, then, does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees, or who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age, ask him; he will answer for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents spoke thus, because they fear the Jews: for the Jews had already determined, that whosoever acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah, should be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>For this reason his parents said, He is of age, ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>A second time, therefore, they called the man, who had been born blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He replied, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, I now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he make you see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered, I told you before; did you not hear? Why would you hear it repeated? Will you, also, be his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>They reviled him and said, You are his disciple. As for us, we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not whence he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man replied, This is surprising, that you know not whence he is, although he has given me sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God hears not sinners; but if any man worship God, and obey him, that man he hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Never was it heard before, that any man gave sight to one born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They replied, You were altogether born in sin, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having met him, said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, Who is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said to him, Not only have you seen him; but it is he, who talks with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>And he cried, Master, I believe; and threw himself prostrate before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some Pharisees, who were present, hearing this, said to him, Are we also blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus answered, If you were blind, you would not have sin: but you say, We see: therefore your sin remains.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who enters not by the gate into the sheepfold, but climbs over the fence, is a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>The shepherd always enters by the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>To him, the porter opens, and the sheep obey his voice. His own sheep he calls by name, and leads out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>And having put out his sheep, he walks before them, and they follow him; because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>They will not follow a stranger, but flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus addressed this similitude to them, but they did not comprehend what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>He therefore added, Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the gate of the fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All who preceded me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep obeyed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the gate: such as enter by me shall be safe: they shall go in and out, and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes in only to steal, to slay, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>The hireling, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, when he sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and flees; and the wolf tears them, and disperses the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd. And I know my own, and am known by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>(even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father;) and I give my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have other sheep, besides, which are not of this fold. Them I must also bring; and they will obey my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>For this the Father loves me, because I give my life, to be afterward resumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one forces it from me: but I give it of myself. I have power to give it, and I have power to resume it. This commandment I have received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Again there was a division among the Jews, occasioned by this discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad: why do you hear him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>Others said, These are not the words of a demonize. Can a demon give sight to the blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>Afterward, when they were celebrating the feast of the dedication, at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>it being in winter; as Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's portico,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>the Jews surrounding him, said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you be the Messiah, tell us plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered, I told you; but you believed not. The works which I do in my Father's name, testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>But you believe not, for you are not of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep, as I told you, obey my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>Besides, I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any one wrest them out of my hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus said to them, Many good works I have shown you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered, For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>«Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law,'I said, You are gods?'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If the law styled them gods, to whom the word of God was addressed, and if the language of scripture in unexceptionable;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>They then attempted again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and retired again toward the Jordan, and abode in the place where John first immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many resorted to him, who said, John, indeed, wrought no miracle: but all that John spoke of this man, is true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now, one Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples answered, Rabbi, but very lately the Jews would have stoned you, and you would return thither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not: because he sees the light of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if he walk in the night, he stumbles; because there is no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Having spoken this, he added, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go to wake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then said his disciples, Master, if he sleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And on your account I am glad that I was not there, that you may believe; but let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, that is, Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now, (Bethany being about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>many of the Jews came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them on the death of their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha having heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary remained in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, Master, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know that even now, whatever you shall ask of God, God will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha replied, I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes on me, though he were dead, shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and no man who lives and believes on me, shall ever die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She answered, Yes, Master, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>Having said this, she went and called Mary, her sister, aside, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mary heard this, she instantly rose and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews, then, who were condoling with Mary in the house, when they saw that she arose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary being come to the place where Jesus was, and seeing him, threw herself at his feet, saying, Had you be here, Master, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping, who came with her, he groaned deeply, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have you laid him? They answered, and said, Master, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews, therefore, said, Mark how he loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not he who gave sight to the blind man, even have prevented this man's death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, therefore, again, groaning, came to the tomb. It was a cave, the entrance of which was shut up with a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Remove the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, answered, Sir, by this time, the smell is offensive, for this is the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus replied, Did I not say to you, If you believe, you shall see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they removed the stone. And Jesus, lifting up his eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>As for me, I know that thou hearest me always; but I speak, for the people's sake who surround me, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>After these words, raising his voice, he cried, Lazarus, come forth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>He who had been dead, came forth, bound hand and foot with fillets, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many, therefore, of the Jews, who had come to Mary, and seen what he did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of the repaired to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrim, and said, What are we doing? for this man works many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him go on thus, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>One of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You are utterly at a loss,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>and do not consider, that it is better for us that one man die for the people, than that the whole nation should be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>This he spoke, not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but that he should assemble into one body the dispersed children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day, therefore, they concerted how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>For that reason, Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews, but retired to the country, near the desert, to a city called Ephraim; and continued there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Meantime, the Jewish passover approached, and many went to Jerusalem from the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>These inquired after Jesus, and said, one to another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think? Will he not come to the festival?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order, that whosoever knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of those who were at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, taking a pound of the balsam of spikenard, which was very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair, so that the house was filled with the odor of the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>On which, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this balsam sold for three hundred denarii, which might have been given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and carried what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has reserved this to embalm me, against the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you will always have the poor among you; but me you will not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great number of the Jews, knowing where he was, flocked thither, not on account of Jesus only, but likewise to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The chief priests, therefore, determined to kill Lazarus also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because he proved the occasion that many Jews forsook them, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day, a great multitude, who were come to the festival, hearing that Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet him, crying, Hosanna! blessed be Israel's King, who comes in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Now Jesus having found a young ass, was riding on it, agreeably to what is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>«Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things the disciples did not understand, at first; but after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that thus it had been written concerning him, and that thus they had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>And the people who had been present, attested that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>It was the rumor that he had wrought this miracle, which made the people crowd to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, Are you not sensible that you have no influence? Behold the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now, among those who came to worship at the festival, there were some Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These applied to Philip, of Bethsaida, in Galilee, making this request, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus answered them, saying, The time is come, when the Son of Man must be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Most assuredly, I say to you, when a grain of wheat is thrown into the ground, unless it die, it remains single; but if it die, it becomes very fruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world, shall preserve it eternally in the next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>Would any man serve me? let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any man serve me, my Father will reward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came on purpose for this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice out of heaven, which said, I have both glorified, and will again glorify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The people present heard the sound, and said, It thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now must this world be judged. Now must the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>As for me, when I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This he said, alluding to the death which he was to suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered, We have learned from the law, that the Messiah will live forever. How do you say, then, that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light continues with you; walk, while you have it, lest darkness overtake you: for he that walks in darkness knows not whither he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>Confide in the light, while you enjoy it, that you may be sons of light. Having spoken these words, he withdrew himself privately from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But, though he had performed so many miracles before them, they believed not on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>«so that the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,» 'Lord, who has believed out report?' 'and, '«To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they could not believe; Isaiah having said, also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>«He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their understanding, that they might not see with their eyes, comprehend with their understanding, and be converted, that I might heal them.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, there were several, even of the magistrates, who believed on him; but, for fear of the Pharisees, did not avow it, lest they should be expelled the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they preferred approbation of men to the approbation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus, raising his voice, said, He who believes on me, believes not on me only; but on him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who beholds me, beholds him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me, may not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hear my words, but do not observe them; it is not I, who condemn him; for I came, not to condemn the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who despises me, and rejects my instructions, has that which condemns him. The doctrine which I have taught will condemn him at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not said anything from myself; but the Father who sent me, has commanded me what I should enjoin, and what I should teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know, that his commandment is eternal life. Whatever, therefore, I say, I speak as the Father has given me in charge.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Jesus having perceived, before the feast of the passover, that his time to remove out of this world to his Father, was come; and having loved his own, who were in the world, he loved them to the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>Now while they were at the supper, (the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, though he knew that the Father had subjected everything to him, and that he came from God, and was returning to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>arose from supper, and laying aside his mantle, girt himself about with a towel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, Master, would you wash my feet?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus replied, He who has been bathing, needs only to wash his feet; the rest of his body being clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>You are clean, but not all. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, You are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>After he had washed their feet, he put on his mantle, and replacing himself at table, said to them, Do you understand what I have been doing to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had spoken these words, he passed, with his disciples, over the brook Kidron; where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Then Judas, having got the cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>But Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene. Jesus replied, I am he. Now Judas, who betrayed him, was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>He had no sooner said to them, I am he, than they, going backward, fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>He, therefore, asked them again, Whom do you seek? They said, Jesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, I have told you, that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let these go away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>Thus was that which he had spoken verified, Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus then said to Peter, Put up the sword into the scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the cohort, and their commander, and the Jewish officers, apprehended Jesus; and having bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>brought him first to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Now it was Caiaphas, who had said in council to the Jews, It is expedient that one man die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Meantime Simon Peter, and another disciple, followed Jesus. That disciple, being known to the high priest, entered his court with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood without, at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then the maid, the portress, said to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He answered, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now, the servants and the officers, stood near a fire, which they had made, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>Then the high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews constantly resort. I said nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you examine me? Examine them who heard me teach. They know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had spoken thus, one of the officers who attended, gave him a blow, and said, Do you answer the high priest thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus replied, If I have spoken amiss, show in what the wrong consists: but if well, why do you smite me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Now, Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>As Peter stood warming himself, they asked him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter denied again; and immediately the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium: it was now morning; but the Jews entered not the praetorium, lest they should be defiled, and so not in a condition to eat the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate, therefore, went out to them, and said, Of what do you accuse this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered, If he were not a criminal, we would not have delivered him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate said, Then take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews replied, We are not permitted to put any man to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>And thus, what Jesus had spoken, signifying what death he should die, was accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate returned to the praetorium, and having called Jesus, said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate replied, Am I am Jew? Your own nation, yes, the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my adherents would have fought to prevent my falling into the hands of the Jews; but my kingdom is not hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Then Pilate said, You are a King, then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a King. For this I was born; and for this I came into the world, to give testimony to the truth. Whosoever is of the truth, hearkens to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate asked him, What is truth? and so saying, went out again to the Jews, and said to them, For my part, I find nothing culpable in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But since it is customary that I release to you one at the passover, will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate caused him to be scourged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers crowned him with a wreath of thorn, which they had platted; and having thrown a purple mantle about him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>said, Hail! King of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went out again, and said to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find in him nothing culpable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus then went forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple mantle, and Pilate said to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for my part, I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he assumed the title of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard this, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and having returned to the praetorium, said to Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to him, Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and power to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus replied, You could have no power over me, unless it were given you from above; wherefore, he who delivered me to you, has greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews exclaimed, If you release this man, you are not Cesar's friend. Whoever calls himself king, opposes Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, on hearing these words, ordered Jesus to be brought forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place named The Pavement; in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(Now it was the preparation of the Paschal Sabbath, about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, Behold your King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away, away with him; crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no King but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>He delivered him, therefore, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>Then they took Jesus, and led him away. And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called The Place of Skulls, which is, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and two others with him; one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. The words were, JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>And many of the Jews read this title, (for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh the city,) and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>then the chief priests said to Pilate, Write not the King of the Jews; but, Who calls himself King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his mantle and divided it into four parts, one to every soldier: they also took the coat, which was seamless, woven from the top throughout;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>«and said, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but determine by lot whose it shall be; by this verifying the scripture, which says,» 'They shared my mantle among them, and cast lots for my vesture.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Thus, therefore, acted the soldiers. Now, there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and her sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Then Jesus, observing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, said to his mother, Woman, behold your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, (knowing that all was now accomplished,) that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>And there was a vessel there full of vinegar, they filled a sponge with vinegar, and, having fastened it to a twig of hyssop, held it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and bowing his head, yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, therefore, lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for it was the preparation, (and that Sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and the bodies might be removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Accordingly, the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first and of the other, who were crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, whence blood and water immediately issued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>He was an eye-witness, who attests this, and his testimony deserves credit: nay, he is conscious that he speaks truth, that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>«For these things happened that the scripture might be verified,» 'None of his bones shall be broken.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>«Again, the scripture elsewhere says,» 'They shall look on him whom they have pierced.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph, the Arimathean, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed disciple for fear of the Jews, asked permission of Pilate to take away the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus also, who had formerly repaired to Jesus by night, came, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>These men took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen rollers, with the spices, which is the Jewish manner of embalming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There they deposited Jesus, on account of the Jewish preparation, the tomb being near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week, Mary, the Magdalene, went early to the sepulcher, while it was yet dark; and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken the Master out of the sepulcher; and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Immediately Peter went out, and the other disciple, to go to the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>and both ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping down, he saw the linen rollers lying, but went not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then came Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulcher, where he observed the rollers lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the handkerchief which had been wrapped about his head, not laid beside them, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher, entered also; and he saw, and believed the report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For, as yet, they did not understand from the scriptures, that he was to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples returned to their companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood without, near the sepulcher, weeping. As she wept, stooping down to look into the sepulcher,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>she saw two angles in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head, the other at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She answered, Because they have taken away my Master, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>Having said this, she turned about, and saw Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus aid to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, answered, Sir, if you have conveyed him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary. She, turning, said to him, Rabboni; that is, Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary, the Magdalene, went and informed the disciples, that she had seen the Master, and that he had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>In the evening of that day, the first of the week, Jesus came where the disciples were convened, (the doors having been shut, for the fear of the Jews,) and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>Having said this, he showed them his hand and his side. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced when they saw it was their Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said again to them, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, so do I send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>After these words, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whose sins soever you remit, are remitted to them; and whose sins soever you retain, are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now, Thomas, that is, Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them, when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples, therefore, said to him, We have seen the Master. But he answered, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger to the print of the nails, and my hand to his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Eight days after, the disciples being again in the house, and Thomas with them, Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then turning to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, he said, and look at my hands; reach also your hand, and feel my side; and be not incredulous, but believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered, My Lord, and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus replied, Because you see me, you believe; happy they, who, having never seen, shall nevertheless believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other miracles Jesus likewise performed in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are recorded, that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and, that believing, you may have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>Afterward, Jesus again appeared to the disciples, at the sea of Tiberias; and in this manner he appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter and Thomas, that is, Didymus, Nathanael of Cana, in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus, being together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said, I am going a-fishing. They answered, We will go with you. Immediately they went, and got aboard a bark, but that night caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>In the morning Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples, however, knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, My children, have you any victuals? They answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>Cast the net, cried he, on the right side of the bark, and you will find. They did so, but were not able to draw it, by reason of the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, It is the Master. Simon Peter, hearing that it was the Master, girt on his upper garment (which was laid aside) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not farther from land than about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net, with the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they came ashore, they saw a fire burning, and a fish laid on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, Bring of the fishes which you have now taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went back, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and the net was not rent, notwithstanding the number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come and dine. Meantime none of the disciples ventured to ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus drew near, and taking bread and fish, distributed among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples, after his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>A second time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Tend my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>A third time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Peter, grieved at his asking this question a third time, answered, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Most assuredly, I say to you, in your youth you girt yourself, and went whither you would; but in your old age, you shall stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you whither you would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. After these words, he said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>And Peter turning about, saw the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following, (the same who, leaning on his breast at the supper, had asked who it was, that would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, And what, Lord, shall become of this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus answered, If I will that he wait my return, what is that to you? Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Hence arose the rumor among the brethren, that that disciple should not die; nevertheless, Jesus said not, that he should not die; but, If I will, that he wait my return, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>It is this disciple, who attests these things, and wrote this account; and we know that his testimony deserves credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>There were many other things also performed by Jesus, which, were they to be severally related, I imagine, the world itself could not contain the volumes that would be written.</verse>
