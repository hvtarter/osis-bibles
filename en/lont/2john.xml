        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder, to Electa Cyria, and her children, whom I love sincerely; and not I only, but also all who have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth's sake, which is in us, and shall be with us forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Favor, mercy, and peace, be with you, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly, when I found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech you, Cyria, not as writing to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is the love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you have heard from the beginning, that you may walk in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>for many deceivers are entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ did come in the flesh. This is the deceiver, and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we may not lose the things which we have wrought, but may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever transgresses, and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ, has not God: he who abides in the doctrine of Christ, has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one come to you, and bring not this doctrine; receive him not into your house, nor wish him success:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who wishes him success, partakes in his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I did not incline to communicate them by paper and ink; because I hope to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your beloved sister, salute you.</verse>
