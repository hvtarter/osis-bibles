  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of those things, which have been accomplished amongst us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>as they, who were from the beginning, eye-witnesses, and afterwards ministers of the word, delivered them to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>I have also determined, having exactly traced everything from the first, to write a particular account for you, most excellent Theophilus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you might know the certainty of those matters wherein you have been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah; and his wife, named Elizabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous before God, blameless observers of all the Lord's commandments and ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now when he came to officiate as priest in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to offer incense in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And while the incense was burning, the whole congregation were praying without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias was discomposed at the sight, and in great terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for your prayer is heard, and Elizabeth your wife shall bear you a son, whom you shall name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>He shall be to you matter of joy and transport; and many shall rejoice because of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord; he shall not drink wine nor any fermented liquor; but he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Israel he shall bring back to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>Moreover, he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children, and by the wisdom of the righteous, to render the disobedient a people well disposed for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this: for I am old man, and my wife is advanced in years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God, and am sent to tell you this joyful news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But know that you shall be dumb, and shall not recover your speech, till the day when these things happen, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he staid so long in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; for he made them understand by signs, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when his days of officiating were expired, he returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Soon after, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and lived in retirement five months, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>The Lord has done this for me, purposing now to deliver me from the reproach I lay under among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now, in the sixth month, God sent Gabriel his angel, to Nazareth, a city of Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man called Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>When the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favorite of heaven! the Lord be with you, happiest of women!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>At his appearance and words, she was perplexed, and revolved in her mind what this salutation could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, whom you shall name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: his reign shall never end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I have no intercourse with man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answering, said to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore the holy progeny shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And lo! your cousin Elizabeth also has conceived, a son in her old age; and she who is called barren, is now in her sixth month;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>for nothing is impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to your word. Then the angel departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>In those days Mary set out, and traveled expeditiously into the hill country; to a city of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>where having entered the house of Zacharias, she saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and cried with a loud voice, You are the most blessed of women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But how have I deserved this honor, to be visited by the mother of my Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>for know, that as soon as the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord has promised her, shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>because he has not disdained the low condition of his handmaid; for henceforth, all posterity will pronounce me happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For the Almighty, whose name is venerable, has done wonders for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>His mercy on them who fear him, extends to generations of generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He displays the strength of his arm, and dispels the vain imaginations of the proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He pulls down potentates from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The needy he loads with benefits; but the rich he spoils of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He supports Israel his servant, ever inclined to mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(as he promised to our fathers) toward Abraham and his race.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary, after staying with Elizabeth about three months, returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>When the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she brought forth a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and her neighbors and relations who heard that the Lord had shown her great kindness, rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And, on the eighth day, when they came to the circumcision of the child, they would have called him by his father's name, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother interposed, saying, No; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, There is none of your kindred of that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They, therefore, asked his father by signs, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He, having demanded a table-book, wrote upon it, His name is John, which surprised them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened directly, and his tongue loosed. And he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Now all in the neighborhood were struck with awe; and the fame of these things spread throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard these things, pondering them in their hearts, said, What will this child hereafter be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then Zacharias, his father, being filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised a Prince for our deliverance in the house of David his servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>(as anciently he promised by his holy prophets)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>for our deliverance from our enemies, and from the hands of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>in kindness to our forefathers, and remembrance of his holy institution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to grant to us, that being rescued out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him boldly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in piety and uprightness all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the Lord, to prepare his way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>by giving the knowledge of salvation to his people, in the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender compassion of our God, who has caused a light to spring from on high to visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to enlighten those who abide in darkness and in the shades of death; to direct our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>Meantime the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, and continued in the deserts, until the time when he made himself known to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>About that time, Cesar Augustus issued an edict, that all the inhabitants of the empire should be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(This first register took effect, when Cyrenius was president of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>When all went to be registered, every one of his own city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, to a city of David in Judea, called Bethlehem, (for he was of the house and lineage of David,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered, with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there, the time came, that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her first born son, and swathed him, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the house allotted to strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>Now there were shepherds in the fields in that country, who tended their flocks by turns through the night watches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>On a sudden, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and a divine glory encompassed them with light, and they were frightened exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>But the angel said to them, Fear not; for lo! I bring you good tidings, which shall prove matter of great joy to all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>because today is born to you in the city of David, a Saviour, who is the Lord Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And by this you shall know him; you shall find a babe in swaddling bands, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>Instantly the angel was attended by a multitude of the heavenly host, who praised God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace, and good will amongst men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels returned to heaven, having left the shepherds, these said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which has happened, of which the Lord has informed us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And hastening thither, they found Mary and Joseph with the babe, who lay in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they saw this, they published what had been imparted to them, concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it, wondered at the things told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary let none of these things escape unobserved, weighing every circumstance within herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all that they had heard and seen, agreeably to what had been declared to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>On the eighth day, when the child was circumcised, they called him Jesus, the angel having given him that name, before his mother conceived him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the time of their purification was expired, they carried him to Jerusalem, as the law of Moses appoints, to present him to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>«(as it is written in the law of God,'Every male, who is the first born of his mother, is consecrated to the Lord:')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer the sacrifices enjoined in the law, a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>Now there was at Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a just and religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>and had revealed to him, that he should not dies, until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>This man came, guided by the Spirit, into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what the law required,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now, Lord, thou dost in peace dismiss thy servant, according to thy word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen the Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>whom thou hast provided in the sight of all the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a luminary to enlighten the nations, and to be the glory of Israel thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph, and the mother of Jesus heard, with admiration, the things spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, This child is destined for the fall and the rise of many in Israel, to serve as a mark for contradiction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yes, you own soul shall be pierced as with a javelin;) that the thoughts of many hearts may be disclosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>There was also a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, in advanced age, who had lived seven years with a husband, whom she married when a virgin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and being now a widow about eighty-four years, departed not from the temple, but served God in prayer and fasting night and day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>she also coming in at that instant, gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Jesus to all those in Jerusalem who expected redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>After they had performed everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, being filled with wisdom, and adorned with a divine gracefulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now, the parents of Jesus went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they having gone thither, according to the usage of the festival, and remained the customary time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>being on their return, the child Jesus staid behind in Jerusalem, and neither Joseph nor his mother knew it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>They supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and then sought him among their relations and acquaintances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard him, were amazed at his understanding and answers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>and they beheld him with astonishment. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us thus? Behold, your father and I have sought you with sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He answered, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in the courts of my Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not comprehend his answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he returned with them to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and stature, and in power with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, Pontius Pilate being procurator of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, Philip, his brother, tetrarch of Iturea, and the province of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went through all the country along the Jordan, publishing the immersion of reformation for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>«As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Let every valley be filled, every mountain and hill be leveled; let the crooked roads be made straight, and the rough ways smooth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>«that all flesh may see the salvation of God.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitudes, who flocked out to be immersed by him, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Produce, then, the proper fruits of reformation; and say not within yourselves, We have Abraham for a father; for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>Upon this, the multitude asked him, What must we do then?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered, Let him who has two coats, impart to him who has none; and let him who has victuals do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>There came also publicans to be immersed, who said, Rabbi, what must we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>He answered, Exact no more than what is appointed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Soldiers likewise asked him, And what must we do? He answered, Injure no man, either by violence, or false accusation, and be content with your allowance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>As the people were in suspense concerning John, every man imagining within himself that he might be the Messiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John addressed them all, saying, I, indeed, immerse in water; but one mightier than I comes, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to untie; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>his winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather the wheat into his granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>And with many other exhortations, he published the good tidings to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod, the tetrarch, having been reproved by him, on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the crimes which Herod had committed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this to the number, that he confined John in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now when John immersed all the people, Jesus was likewise immersed; and while he prayed, the heaven was opened,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Now Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>where he continued forty days, and was tempted by the devil. Having eaten nothing all that time, when it was ended he was hungry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>and the devil said to him, If thou be God's Son, command this stone to become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>«Jesus answered him, saying, It is written,'Man does not live by bread only, but by whatever God pleases.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>Then the devil, having brought him to the top of a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>and said to him, All this power and glory I will give thee; for it is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>if, therefore, thou wilt worship me, it shall all be thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>«Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and placing him on the battlement of the temple, said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down hence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>«for it is written,» 'He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>«and, in their arms they shall uphold thee, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>«Jesus answered, It is said,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus, by the impulse of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and his renown spread throughout the whole country,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>and he taught in their synagogues with universal applause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>Being come to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he entered the synagogue, as his custom was, on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And they put into his hands the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book, he found the place where it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>«The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, inasmuch as he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to the poor, to announce liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed,»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>«to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And having closed the book, and returned it to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And he began with saying to them, This very day, the scripture which you have just now heard, is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all extolled him; but being astonished at the gracious words which he uttered, they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>«He said to them, You will doubtless apply to me this proverb,» 'Physician, cure yourself.' 'Do as great things here in your own country, as we hear you have done in Capernaum.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>But in fact, added he, No prophet was ever well received in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>I tell you of a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was shut up for three years and a half, so that there was great famine throughout all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to a widow in Sarepta, of Sidonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>There were likewise many lepers in Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet; and Naaman the Syrian was cleansed, but none of those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>On hearing this, the whole synagogue were enraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and breaking up, drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then he came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were struck with awe at his manner of teaching; for he spoke with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>Now there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, who roared out, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>Ah! Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art-the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. On this, the demon, having thrown him into the middle of the assembly, came out without harming him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all in amazement, and said one to another, What does this mean, that with authority and power he command the unclean spirits, and they come out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>From that time, his fame was published in every corner of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>When he was gone out of the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon, whose wife's mother had a violent fever, and they entreated him on her behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>Jesus, standing near her, rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she instantly arose, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>After sunset, all they who had any sick, of whatever kind of disease, brought them to him; and he, laying his hands on every one, cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons also came out of many, crying out, Thou art the Son of God. But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>When it was day, he retired into a desert place; and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and urged him not to leave them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the Reign of God in other cities also, because for this purpose I am sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>Accordingly, he made this publication in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it happened, as he stood by the lake Gennesaret, the multitude pressing upon him to hear the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>that seeing two barks aground, near the shore, the fishermen having landed to wash their nets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>he went aboard one of them, which was Simon's; and desiring him to put off a little from the land, sat down, and taught the people out of the bark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had done speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, Master, we have toiled all night, and have caught nothing; nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>Having done this, they inclosed such a multitude of fishes, that the net began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned to their companions, in the other bark, to come and help them. And they came, and loaded both their barks, so that they were near sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For the draught of fishes which they had taken had filled him and all his companions with terror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>particularly James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, henceforth you shall catch men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And having brought their barks to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>When he was in one of the neighboring cities, a man covered with leprosy, happened to see him, threw himself on his face, and besought him, saying, Master, if you will, you can cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Jesus stretching out his hand, and touching him, said, I will; be you cleansed. That instant his leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he commanded him to tell no person. But go, said he, show yourself to the priest, and present the offered appointed by Moses, for notifying the people that you are cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>Yet so much the more was Jesus everywhere talked of, that vast multitudes flocked to hear him, and to be cured by him of their maladies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And he withdrew into solitary places, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day, as he was teaching, and Pharisees, and doctors of law, who had come from Jerusalem, and from every town of Galilee and Judea, were sitting by, the power of the Lord was exerted in the sure of the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And, behold, some men carrying on a bed a man afflicted with a palsy, endeavored to bring him in, and place him before Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>but finding it impracticable, by reason of the crowd, they got upon the roof, and let him down through the tiling, with the little bed, in the midst before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Jesus perceiving their faith, said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>On which the Scribes and the Pharisees reasoned thus, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Can any one forgive sins except God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Jesus knowing their thoughts, addressed himself to them, and said, What are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, Arise, said he to the palsied man, take up your bed, and return to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>That instant he rose in their presence, took up his bed, and returned home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Seeing this, they were all struck with amazement and reverence, and glorified God, saying, We have seen wonderful things today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this, he went out, and observing a publican, named Levi, sitting at the toll-office, said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And he arose, left all, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great entertainment in his own house, where there was a great company of publicans and others, at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>But the Scribes and the Pharisees of the place murmured, saying to his disciples, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answering, said to them, It is not the healthy, but the sick, who need a physician.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am come to call, not the righteous, but sinners, to reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Then they asked him, How is it that the disciples of John, and likewise those of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but yours eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>He answered, Would you have the bridesmen fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them: in those days they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He added this similitude, No man mends an old mantle with new cloth; otherwise the new will rend the old; besides, the old and new will never suit each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise, the new wine will burst the bottles, and thus the wine will be spoiled, and the bottles rendered useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But if new wine be put into new bottles, both will be preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>Besides, a man, after drinking old wine, calls not immediately for new; for he says, The old is milder.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>On the Sabbath called second prime, as Jesus was passing through the cornfields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands and eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>And some Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus replying, said to them, Did you never read what David and his attendants did, when they were hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered the mansion of God, and took and eat the loaves of the presence, and gave also of this bread to his attendants; though it can not be lawfully eat by any but the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>He added, The Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>It happened also on another Sabbath, that he went into the synagogue and taught; and a man was there whose right hand was blasted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>Now the Scribes and the Pharisees watched, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find matter for accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to the man, whose hand was blasted, Arise, and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, I would ask you, What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath? Good or ill? To save, or to destroy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And, looking around on them all, he said to the man, stretch out your hand; and in doing this, his hand was rendered sound like the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with madness, and consulted together, what they should do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>In those days, Jesus retired to a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in an oratory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>When it was day, he called to him his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he named Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.14'>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James, and John, Philip, and Bartholomew;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.15'>Matthew, and Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Judas, brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>Afterward, Jesus, coming down with them, stopped on a plain, where a company of his disciples, with a vast multitude from all parts of Judea, Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. Those also who were infested with unclean spirits, came, and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>And every one strove to touch him, because a virtue came from him, which healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Then fixing his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy you poor, for the kingdom of God is yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.21'>Happy you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied! Happy you that weep now, for you shall laugh!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.22'>Happy shall you be when men shall hate you, and separate your from their society; yes, reproach and defame you, on account of the Son of Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.23'>Rejoice on that day, and triumph, knowing that your reward in heaven is great! for thus did their fathers treat the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.24'>But alas, for you rich; for you have received your comforts!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.25'>Alas, for you that are full; for you shall hunger! Alas, for you who laugh now; for you shall mourn and weep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.26'>Alas, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers of the false prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.27'>But I charge you, my hearers, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.28'>bless them who curse you, pray for them who traduce you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.29'>To him who smites you on one cheek, present the other; and from him who takes your mantle, withhold not your coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.30'>Give to every one who asks you; and from him who takes away your goods, do not demand them back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.31'>And as you would that men should do to you, do you likewise to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.32'>For if you love those who love you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners love those who love them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.33'>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.34'>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners lend to sinners, that they may received as much in return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.35'>But love your enemies, do good and lend, nowise despairing; and your reward shall be great; and you shall be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and malignant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.36'>Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.37'>Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall be released;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.39'>He also used this comparison: Can the blind guide the blind? Will not both fall into a ditch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.40'>The disciple is not above his teacher; but every finished disciple shall be as his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.41'>And why do you observe the mote in your brother's eyes; but perceive not the splinter in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>Or how can you say to your brothers, Brother, let me take out the mote which is in your eye, not considering that there is a splinter out of your own eye; then you will see to take out the mote which is in your brother's eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.43'>That is not a good tree which yields bad fruit; nor is that a bad tree which yields good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.44'>For every tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered off thorns; nor grapes off a bramble-bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings that which is good: the bad man out of the bad treasure of his heart, brings that which is bad; for it is out of the fulness of the heart that the mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.46'>But why do you, in addressing me, cry, Master, Master, and obey not my commands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>Whoever comes to me and hears my precepts, and practices them, I will show you whom he resembles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>he resembles a man who built a house, and digging deep, laid the foundation upon the rock: and when an inundation came, the torrent broke upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded upon rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears, and does not practice, resembles a man, who, without laying a foundation, built a house upon the earth: which, when the torrent broke against it, fell, and became a great pile of ruins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>When he had finished his discourse in the audience of the people, he entered Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a centurion's servant, who was dear to his master, was sick, and in danger of dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And the centurion, having heard concerning Jesus, sent to him Jewish elders, to entreat him to come and save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>When they came to Jesus, they earnestly besought him, saying, He is worthy of this favor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nations; and it was he who built our synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them; and when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, to say, Master, trouble not yourself; for I have not deserved that you should come under my roof;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they who had been sent, having returned to the house, found the servant well, who had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>The day following, he went into a city called Nain, accompanied by his disciples, and a great crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he approached the gate of the city, the people were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, who was a widow; and many of the citizens were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her, he had pity upon her, and said to her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Then he advanced and touched the bier, (the bearers stopping,) and said, Young man, arise, I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>Then he who had been dead, sat up, and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And all present were struck with awe, and glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us; and God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report, concerning him, spread throughout Judea, and all the neighboring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>Now John's disciples had informed him of all these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>and he called two of them, whom he sent to Jesus, to ask him, Are you He who comes, or must we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>Being come to him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to ask you, Are you He who comes, or must we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that very time Jesus was delivering man from diseases and maladies, and evil spirits, and giving sight to many, who were blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he returned this answer, Go, and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind are made to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear; the leprous are cleansed, the dead are raised, glad tidings are brought to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And happy is he to whom I shall not prove a stumbling block.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When John's messengers were departed, Jesus said to the multitude, concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man effeminately dressed? It is in royal palaces that they who wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>What then did you go to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and something superior to a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>«For this is he, concerning whom it is written,'Behold, I send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I declare to you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser; yet, the least in the Reign of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>All the people, even the publicans, who heard John, have, by receiving immersion from him, honored God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>whereas, the Pharisees and the lawyers, in not being immersed by him, have rejected the counsel of God with regard to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To what shall I compare the men of this generation? Whom are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children in the market place, of whom their companions complain, and say, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Immerser is come, abstaining from bread and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners; and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man is come, using both; and you say, He is a lover of banquets, and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him: and he went into the Pharisee's house, and placed himself at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner, knowing that he eat at the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of balsam,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind at his feet weeping, bathed them with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>The Pharisee, who had invited him, observing this, said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would have known who this woman is that touches him, and of what character, for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Then Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. He answered, Say it, Rabbi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>But not having the means to pay, he freely forgave them both. Say, then, which of them will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, I suppose he whom he forgave most? Jesus replied, You have judged right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then turning to the woman, he said, Simon, Do you see this woman? When I came to your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss; but she, since she entered, has not ceased kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Wherefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; therefore, her love is great. But he to whom little is forgiven, has little love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Then he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Those, who were at table with him, said within themselves, Who is this, that even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Afterward he traveled through cities and villages, proclaiming the joyful tidings of the Reign of God, being attended by the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and by certain women, who had been delivered from evil spirits and distempers; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna, and several others, who assisted him with their property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>Now, when a great multitude was assembled, and the people were flocking to him, out of the cities, he spoke by a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The sower went out to sow his grain: and in sowing, part fell by the way-side, and was crushed under foot, or picked up by the birds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>part fell upon a rock, and when it was sprung up, withered away for want to moisture;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>part of it also fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>and part fell into good soil, and sprung up, and yielded increase, a hundred fold. Having said this, he cried, Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What does this parable mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He answered, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, which, to others, are couched in parables; that, though they look, they may not perceive; that though they hear, they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now, this is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>By the wayside are meant those hearers out of whose hearts the devil coming, takes away the word, these they should believe, and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>By the rock are meant those, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet not having it rooted in them, are but temporary believers; for in the time of trial they fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>By the ground encumbered with thorns, are meant those hearers who are entangled in the business, and pursuits, and pleasures of life; which stifle the word, so that it brings no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But by the good soil are meant those, who, having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and persevere in bringing forth fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>A lamp is never lighted to be covered with a vessel, or put under a bed; but to be set on a stand, that they who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is no secret which shall not be discovered; nor anything concealed which shall not be known, and become public.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Take heard, therefore, how you hear; for to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then his mother and brothers came to speak with him; but could not get near him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told him by some persons, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he, answering, said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day, Jesus having gone into a bark with his disciples, said to them, Let us cross the lake. Accordingly they set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But while they sailed, he fell asleep; and there blew such a storm upon the lake, as filled the bark with water, and endangered lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to him, and awakened him, saying, Master, Master, we perish! Then he arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And Jesus said to them, Where is your faith? But they said one to another, with fear and admiration, Who is this that commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>Being come ashore, a man of the city met him, who had been long possessed by demons; and who wore no clothes, and had no habitation but the sepulchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he roared out, and threw himself at his feet, crying, What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had frequently seized him, so that when he was chained and fettered, he broke his bonds, and was driven by the fiend into the desert.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>«Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is your names? He answered, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they entreated him, that he would not command them to go into the deep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>but, as there was a numerous herd of swine feeding on the mountain, that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons having quitted the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The herdsmen, seeing this, fled, and spread the news through the city and villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And the inhabitants flocked out to see what had happened. Being come to Jesus, and finding the man of whom the demons were dispossessed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>But having been informed by the spectators, in what manner the demoniac delivered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>all the people of the country of the Gadarenes, entreated him to leave them; for they were struck with terror. Accordingly, he re-entered the bark, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now, the man out of whom the demons were gone, entreated his permission to attend him. But Jesus dismissed him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return home, and relate what great things God has done for you. Then he departed, and published through all the city, what great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Jesus, at his return, was welcomed by the crowd, who were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Meantime, a man named Jairus, came, a ruler of the synagogue, who, throwing himself at the feet of Jesus, besought him to come into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As Jesus went along, the people crowded him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>and a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with an issue of blood, and had consumed all her living upon physicians, none of whom could cure her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle; upon which her issue was stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Then Jesus said, Who touched me? When every body denied it, Peter, and those with him, answered, Master, the multitude throng and press you, and do you say, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>Jesus replied, Some person has touched me; for I am sensible that my power was just now exerted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Then the woman perceiving that she was discovered, came trembling, and having thrown herself prostrate, declared to him, before all the people, why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>and he said to her, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you, go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was yet speaking, one came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus, hearing this, said to Jairus, Fear not; only believe, and she shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>Being come to the house, he allowed no person to enter with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the maid's father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all wept, and lamented her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he, having made them all retire, took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maiden, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately, and he commanded to give her food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but he charged them not to mention to any person what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Jesus, having convened the twelve, gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and sent them to proclaim the Reign of God, and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, Provide nothing for your journey; nor staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor two coats apiece;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>and continue in whatever house you are received into, till you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And wheresoever they will not receive you, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protestation against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>They accordingly departed, and traveled through the villages, publishing the good tidings, and performing cures everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod, the tetrarch, having heard of all that Jesus had done, was perplexed; because some said, John is risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and some, Elijah has appeared; and others, One of the ancient prophets is risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he was desirous to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>Now, the Apostles having returned, reported to Jesus all that they had done: and he, taking them with him, retired privately to a desert belonging to the city of Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the multitude, having known it, followed him; and he, receiving them, spoke to them concerning the Reign of God; and he healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>When the day began to decline, the twelve, accosting him, said, Dismiss the people, that they may go to the nearest towns and villages, and provide themselves lodging and food; for we are in a desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>He answered, Supply them yourselves with food. They replied, We have only five loaves and two fishes; unless we go and buy victuals for all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For they were about five thousand men. Then he said to his disciples, Make them recline in parties; fifty in a party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, making them all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to his disciples, to set before the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And they all did eat and were satisfied; and took up twelve baskets full of fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Afterward, Jesus having withdrawn from the multitude to pray, apart with his disciples, asked them, saying, Who do people say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, John the Immerser; others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the ancient prophets is risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Messiah of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>Then, having strictly charged them, he prohibited them from telling this to any person;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>adding, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Moreover, he said to all the people, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take his cross daily, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, with the forfeit or ruin of himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in that of the Father, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I assure you, that there are some standing here, who shall not taste death till they see the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after this discourse, he took with him Peter, and John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>While he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment contracted a dazzling whiteness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And, behold, two men of a glorious aspect, Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>conversed with him, and spoke of the departure which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now, Peter, and those that were with him, were overpowered with sleep; but when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>As these were removing from Jesus, Peter said to him, not knowing what he said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us, then, make three booths, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was speaking, a cloud came and covered them, and the disciples feared, when they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>From the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved; hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>While the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept secret, telling no person, in those days, anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>The next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And one of the crowd cried out, saying, Rabbi, I beseech you, take pity on my son; for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And lo! a spirit seizes him, making him instantly cry out, and fall into convulsions, so that he foams; and after he is much bruised, hardly leaves him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought your disciples to expel the demon; but they were not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then, Jesus answering, said, O incredulous and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring your son hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was coming, the demon dashed him down in convulsions. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and having cured the child, delivered him to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the great power of God. While all were admiring everything which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Mark diligently these words, the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they understood not this language; it was veiled to them, that they might not apprehend it; and they were afraid to ask him concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And there arose a debate among them, which of them should be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, who perceived the thought of their heart, took a child, and placing him near himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>said to them, Whosoever shall receive this child for my sake, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me: for he who is the least amongst you all, this person shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>Then John replied, Master, we saw one expelling demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he consorts not with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>Jesus answered, Forbid not such; for whosoever is not against us, is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now, as the time of his departure approached, he set out resolutely for Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make preparation for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But they would not admit him; because they perceived he was going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>His disciples, James and John, observing this, said, Master, shall we call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them, saying, Do you not know of what spirit you are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they were on the way, one said to him, Master, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter; but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>He said to another, Follow me. He answered, Sir, permit me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus replied, Let the dead bury their dead; but go you and publish the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Another, likewise, said, I will follow you, Sir; but first permit me to take leave of my family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus answered, No man, having put his hand to the plow, looks behind him, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>Afterward, the Lord appointed seventy others, also, and sent them, two and two, before him, into every city and place whither he intended to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>And he said to them, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few: pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go, then; behold, I send you forth as lambs amongst wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Carry no purse, nor bag, nor shoes; and salute no person by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>Whatever house you enter, say, first, Peace be to this house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.6'>And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him; if not, it shall return upon itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.7'>But remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as it affords; for the workman is worthy of his wages; go not from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.8'>And whatever city you enter, if they receive you, eat such things as are set before you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>cure the sick, and say to them, The Reign of God comes upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But whatever city you enter, if they do not receive you, go out into the streets, and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.11'>The very dirt of your streets, which cleaves to us, we wipe off against you; know, however, that the Reign of God draws nigh to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>I assure you, that the condition of Sodom shall be more tolerable on that day, than the condition of that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>Alas, for thee, Chorazin! Alas, for thee, Bethsaida! For if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>Wherefore, the condition of Tyre and Sidon shall be more tolerable, in the judgment, than yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>And thou, Capernaum, which has been exalted in heaven, shall be thrown down to hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Master, even the demons are subject to us, through your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>He said to them, I beheld Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>Lo! I empowered you to turn on serpents, and scorpions, and all the might of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Nevertheless, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>At that time, Jesus was joyful in spirit, and said, I adore thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth; because, having hid these things from sages, and the learned, thou hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, because such is thy pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>My Father has imparted everything to me; and none knows who the Son is, but the Father; nor who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>Then, turning apart, he said to his disciples: Blessed are the eyes which see what you see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>For I assure you, that many prophets and kings have wished to see the things which you see; but have not seen them: and to hear the things which you hear; but have not heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>Then a lawyer stood up, and said, trying him, Rabbi, what must I do to obtain eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>Jesus said to him, What does the law prescribe? What do you read there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>«He answered,» 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But he, desirous to appear blameless, said to Jesus, Who is my neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus said, in return, A man of Jerusalem, traveling to Jericho, fell among robbers; who, having stripped and wounded him, went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>A priest, accidentally going that way, and seeing him, passed by on the father side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.32'>Likewise a Levite, on the road, when he came near the place, and saw him, passed by on the farther side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>and went up to him; and having poured wine and oil into his wounds, he bound them up. Then he set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>On the morrow, when he was going away, he took out two denarii, and giving them to the host, said, Take care of this man, and whatever you spend more, when I return I will repay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>Now which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>The lawyer answered, He who took pity upon him. Then said Jesus, Go you and do in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>And, as he traveled, he went into a village, where a woman named Martha entertained him at her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, listening to his discourse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.40'>but Martha, who was much cumbered about serving, came to him and said, Master, do you not care that my sister leaves me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, assist me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.41'>Jesus answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and trouble yourself about many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.42'>One thing only is necessary. And Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>It happened that Jesus was praying in a certain place; and when he had done, one of his disciples said to him, Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.2'>He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy Reign come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.3'>give us each day our daily bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.4'>and forgive us our sins, for even we forgive all who offend us; and lead us not into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.5'>Moreover, he said to them, Should one of you have a friend, and go to him at midnight, and say, Friend, lend me three loaves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.6'>for a friend of mine is come off his road to see me, and I have nothing to set before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.7'>and he, from within, should answer, Do not disturb me; the door is now locked; I and my children are in bed; I can not rise to give you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.8'>I tell you, though he will not rise and supply him, because he is his friend; he will, because of his importunity, get up, and give him as many as he wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.9'>I likewise tell you, ask, and you shall obtain; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.10'>for whosoever asks, obtains; whosoever seeks, finds; and to every one who knocks, the door is opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.11'>What father amongst you, would give his son a stone when he asks bread; or, when he asks a fish, would, instead of a fish, give him a serpent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.12'>or, when he asks an egg, would give him a scorpion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>If you, therefore, bad as you are, can give good things to your children; how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>Again, he was expelling a demon, which caused dumbness; and when the demon was gone out, the dumb spake, and the people wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>Some, however, said, He expels demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>Others, to try him, asked of him a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, By intestine broils, any kingdom may be desolated, one family falling after another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.18'>Now, if there be intestine broils in the kingdom of Satan; how can that kingdom subsist? for, you say, that I expel demons by Beelzebub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.19'>Moreover, if I by Beelzebub expel demons; by whom do your sons expel them? Wherefore they shall be your judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.20'>But if I, by the finger of God, expel demons, the Reign of God has overtaken you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.21'>When the strong one armed, guards his palace, his effects are secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.22'>But if he who is stronger, shall attack and overcome him, he will strip him of his armor, on which he relied, and dispose of his spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.23'>He who is not for me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.24'>The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, wanders over parched deserts, in search of a resting place. But not finding any, he says, I will return to my house, whence I came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.25'>Being come, he finds it swept and embellished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.26'>Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.27'>While he was saying these things, a woman, raising her voice, cried to him, from amidst the crowd, Happy the womb which bore you! and the breast which suckled you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.28'>Say, rather, replied he, Happy they who hear the word of God, and obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.29'>When the people crowded together, he said, This is an evil generation. They demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, only the sign of Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.30'>For, as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of Man be to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.31'>The queen of the south country will arise in the judgment against the men of this generation, and cause them to be condemned: because she came from the extremities of the earth, to hear the wise discourses of Solomon: and behold, here is something greater than Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.32'>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment against this generation, and cause it to be condemned: because they reformed when warned by Jonah: and behold, here is something greater than Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.33'>A lamp is lighted, not to be concealed, or put under a vessel, but on a stand; that they who enter may have light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.34'>The lamp of the body is the eye: when, therefore, your eye is sound, the whole body is enlightened; but when your eye is distempered, your body is in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.35'>Take heed, then, lest the light which is in you, be darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.36'>If your whole body, therefore, be enlightened, having no part dark; the whole will be so enlightened, as when a lamp lights you by its flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.37'>While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went and placed himself at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.38'>But the Pharisee was surprised to observe that he used no washing before dinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.39'>Then the Lord said to him, As for you, Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of your cups and dishes, while you yourselves are inwardly full of rapacity and malevolence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.40'>Unthinking men! did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.41'>Only give in alms what you have, and all things shall be clean to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.42'>Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you pay the tithe of mint and rue, and of every kind of herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These things you ought to have practiced, and not to have omitted those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.43'>Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you love the most conspicuous seats in synagogues, and salutations in public places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.44'>Alas, for you! because you are like concealed graves, over which people walk without knowing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.45'>Here, one of the lawyers interposing, said, By speaking thus, Rabbi, you reproach us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.46'>He answered, Alas, for you, lawyers! also; because you lade men with intolerable burdens-burdens which you yourselves will not so much as touch with one of your fingers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.47'>Alas, for you! because you build the monuments of the prophets, whom your fathers killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.48'>Surely you are both vouchers and accessories to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their monuments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.49'>Wherefore, thus says the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and Apostles: some of them they will kill, others they will banish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.50'>so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the formation of the world, shall be required of this generation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.51'>from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zechariah, who fell between the altar and the house of God. Yes, I assure you, all shall be required of this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.52'>Alas, for you, lawyers! because you have carried off the key of knowledge; you have not entered yourselves, and those who entering, you hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.53'>While he spoke these things, the Scribes and the Pharisees began vehemently to press him with questions, on many points;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.54'>laying snares for him, in order to draw from his own mouth, matter of accusation against him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.12'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.1'>Meantime, while the crowd, in myriads flocked about him, so that they trod one upon another, he said, addressing himself to his disciples, Above all things, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.2'>For there is nothing covered that shall not be detected: nothing secret that shall not be made known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.3'>What you have spoken in the dark, shall be reported in the light; what you have whispered in the closet, shall be proclaimed from the housetop.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.5'>but I will show you whom you ought to fear; fear him, who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. I repeat it to you, Fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.6'>Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.9'>but whoever denies me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.10'>And whosoever shall inveigh against the Son of Man, may obtain remission; but to him who detracts from the Holy Spirit, there is no remission.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.12'>for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that moment, what ought to be said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.13'>Then one said to him out of the crowd, Rabbi, order my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.14'>He answered, Man, who constituted me your judge or arbiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.15'>And he said to them, Be upon your guard against covetousness; for in whatever affluence a man be, his life depends not on his possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.16'>He also used this example, A certain rich man had lands which brought forth plentifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.17'>And he reasoned thus with himself, What shall I do? for I have not where to store my crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.18'>I will do this, added he; I will pull down my storehouses, and build larger, and there I will store all my produce, and my goods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.22'>Then he said to his disciples, For this reason I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat; nor about your body, what you shall wear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.23'>Life is a greater gift than food, and the body than clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.24'>Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap; have neither cellar nor barn; but God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than fowls?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.27'>Consider the lilies. How do they grow? They toil not; they spin not; yet I affirm, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.48'>whereas, he who knew not, but did things deserving chastisement, shall receive few: for much will be required of every one to whom much is given; and the more a man is entrusted, the more will be exacted from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.49'>I came to throw fire upon the earth; and what would I but that it were kindled?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.1'>There were present then some, who informed Jesus of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.2'>Jesus answering, said to them, Do you think that these Galileans were the greatest sinners in all Galilee, because they suffered such usage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.3'>I tell you, No: but unless you reform, you shall all likewise perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.4'>or, those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and slew them; do you think that they were the greatest profligates in Jerusalem?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.6'>He also spoke this parable: A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and came seeking fruit on it, but found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.7'>Then he said to the vine-dresser, This is the third year that I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, without finding any. Cut it down: why should it cumber the ground?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.8'>He answered, Sir, let it alone one year longer till I dig about it, and manure it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.9'>perhaps it will bear fruit: if not, you may afterward cut it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.10'>On the Sabbath, as he was teaching in a synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.11'>a woman was present, who, for eighteen years, had a spirit of infirmity, by which she was so bowed down that she could not so much as look up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.12'>Jesus, perceiving her, called her to him, and, laying his hand on her, said, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.13'>Immediately she stood upright, and glorified God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.14'>But the director of the synagogue, moved with indignation, because Jesus had performed a cure on the Sabbath, said to the people, There are six days for working; come, therefore, on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.15'>To which the Lord replied, Hypocrites! who is there amongst you that does not, on the Sabbath, loose his ox or ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.16'>And must not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound, lo! these eighteen years, be released from this bond on the Sabbath day?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.19'>It resembles a grain of mustard seed, which a man threw into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air took shelter in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.20'>Again, he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.21'>It resembles leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.22'>And he took a journey to Jerusalem; teaching as he passed through cities and villages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.23'>and one asked him, Master, are there but few who shall be saved? He answered,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.14'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.1'>It happened on a Sabbath, when he was gone to eat at the house of one of the rulers, who was a Pharisee, that while the Pharisees were observing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.2'>a man who had a dropsy stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.3'>Then Jesus addressing himself to the lawyers and Pharisees, said, Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.4'>They being silent, he took hold of the man, healed and dismissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.5'>Then resuming his discourse, he said to them, Who, amongst you, if his ass or his ox fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.6'>And to this they were not able to make him a reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.7'>Observing how eager the guests were to possess the higher places at the table, he gave them this injunction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.8'>When you are invited to a wedding, do not occupy the highest place at table, lest one more considerable than you be bidden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.9'>and he who invited you both, come and say to you, Give place to this man; and you should then rise with confusion, to take the lowest place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.10'>But when you are invited, go to the lowest place, that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher; for that will do you honor before the company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.11'>For whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.12'>He said also to him who had invited him, When you give a dinner, or a supper, do not invited your rich friends, brothers, cousins, or neighbors, lest they also invite you, in their turn, and you be recompensed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.13'>But when you give an entertainment, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.14'>and you shall be happy; for, as they have not the means to requite you, you shall be requited at the resurrection of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.15'>One of the guests, hearing this, said to him, Happy be he who shall feast in the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.16'>Jesus said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.17'>And at supper time he sent his servants, to tell those who had been invited to come presently; for, that all was ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.18'>But they all, without exception, made excuses. One said, I have purchased a field, which I must go and see; I pray you have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.19'>Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, which I am going to prove; I pray you have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.20'>A third said, I have married a wife; and, therefore, I can not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.21'>The servant being returned, related all to his master. Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servants, Go immediately into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.22'>Afterward, the servant said, Sir, your orders are executed, and still there is room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.23'>The master answered, Go out into the highways, and along the hedges, and compel people to come, that my house may be filled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.24'>for I declare to you, that none of those who were invited, shall taste of my supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.25'>As great multitudes traveled along with him, he turned to them, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.26'>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters; nay, and himself, too; he can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.27'>And whosoever does not follow me, carrying his cross, can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.28'>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first, by himself, compute the expense, to know whether he have the means to complete it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.29'>lest, having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish, he become the derision of all who see it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.30'>who will say, This man began to build, but was not able to finish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.31'>Or what king, going to engage another king, with whom he is at war, does not first consult, by himself, whether he can, with ten thousand men, encounter him who comes against him with twenty thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.32'>that if he can not, he may, while the other is at a distance, send an embassy to sue for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.33'>So then, whosoever he be of you, who does not renounce all that he has, he can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.34'>Salt is good; but if the salt become insipid, with what shall it be seasoned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.35'>It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill, but is thrown away. Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.15'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>Now, all the publicans and the sinners resorted to Jesus, to hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>But the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured, saying, This man admits sinners, and eats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>Then he addressed this similitude to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>What man, amongst you, who has a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, to go after that which is lost, till he find it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And having found it, does he not joyfully lay it on his shoulders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>and when he is come home, convene his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>Thus, I assure you, there is greater joy in heaven for one sinner who reforms, than for ninety-nine righteous persons, who need no reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.8'>Or what woman, who has ten drachmas, if she lose one, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.9'>And having found it, does she not assemble her female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>Such joy, I assure you, have the angels of God, when any sinner reforms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>He said, also, A certain man had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my portion of the estate. And he allotted to them their shares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>Soon after, the younger son gathered all together, and traveled into a distant country, and there wasted his substance in riot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>When all was spent, a great famine came upon that land, and he began to be in want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>Then he applied to one of the inhabitants of the country, who sent him into his fields to keep swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>And he desired to appease his hunger with the husks on which the swine were feeding; for no person gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>At length, coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings has my father, who have all more bread than suffices them, while I perish with hunger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.18'>I will arise, and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.19'>and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>And he arose, and went to his father. When he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw himself upon his neck, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>And the son said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>But the father said to his servants, Bring here the principal robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.23'>bring also the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and be merry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.24'>for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. So they began to be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.25'>Now his elder son was in the field, walking home. And as he drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.26'>He, therefore, called one of the servants, and asked the reason of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>He answered, Your brother is returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.28'>And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore, his father came out, and entreated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>He answering, said to his father, These many years I have served you, without disobeying your command in anything; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might entertain my friends;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>but no sooner did this, your son, return, who had squandered your living on prostitutes, than you killed for him the fatted calf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.31'>Son, replied the father, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.32'>it was but reasonable that we should rejoice and be merry; because this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>He said, likewise, to his disciples, A certain rich man had a steward, who was accused to him of wasting his estate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.2'>Having, therefore, called him, he said, What is this that I hear of you? Render an account of your management, for you shall be steward no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? My master takes from me the stewardship; I can not dig, and am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I am resolved what to do, that when I am discarded, there may be some who will receive me into their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>Having, therefore, sent severally for all his master's debtors, he asked one, How much do you owe my master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>He answered, A hundred baths of oil. Take back your bill, said the steward, sit down directly, and write fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.7'>Then he asked another, How much do you owe? He answered, A hundred homers of wheat. Take back your bill, said he, and write eighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>The master commended the prudence of the unjust steward; for the children of this world are more prudent in conducting their affairs, than the children of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>Therefore, I say to you, with the deceitful riches procure to yourself friends, who, after your discharge, may receive you into the eternal mansion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.10'>Whoso is faithful in little is faithful also in much: and whoso is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.11'>If, therefore, you have not been honest in the deceitful, who will entrust you with the true riches?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.12'>And if you have been unfaithful managers for another, who will give you anything to manage for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.13'>A servant can not serve two masters: for either he will hate one, and love the other; or, at least, will attend one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>When the Pharisees, who loved money, heard all these things, they ridiculed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>But he said to them, As for you, you make yourselves pass upon men for righteous, but God knows your hearts; for that which is admired of men is abhorred of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.16'>You had the law and the prophets till the coming of John, since whose time, the kingdom of God is announced, and every occupant enters it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.17'>But sooner shall heaven and earth perish, than one tittle of the law shall fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.18'>Whoever divorces his wife, and takes another, commits adultery; and whoever marries the divorced woman, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.19'>There was a certain rich man, that wore purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.20'>There was also a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, that was laid at his gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.21'>and who was desirous to feed on the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>It happened that the poor man died, and was conveyed by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>And in hades, being in torments, he looked up, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>and cried, saying, Have pity on me, father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tortured in this flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>Abraham answered, Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is in joy, and you are in torments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>Besides, there lies a huge gulf between us and you, so that they who would pass hence to you, can not: neither can they pass to us, who would come thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>The other replied, I entreat you, then, father, to send him to my father's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.28'>for I have five brothers, that he may admonish them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.29'>Abraham answered, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.30'>Nay, said he, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they would reform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.31'>Abraham replied, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should arise from the dead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.17'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.1'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, It is impossible to exclude snares entirely; but, alas, for him who ensnares!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>It would be more eligible for him to have an upper millstone fastened to his neck, and to be cast into the sea, than to ensnare one of these little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.3'>Take heed yourselves: if your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he reforms, forgive him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>When Jesus had entered, and was passing through Jericho,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>behold, a man named Zaccheus, a rich man, and chief of the publicans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>endeavored to see what sort of person he was, but could not for the press, being of a low stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>Therefore, running before, he climbed up into a sycamore, to see him; having observed that he was going that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and seeing him, said, Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>When the multitude perceived this, they said, murmuring, He is gone to be entertained by a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>But Zaccheus, presenting himself before Jesus, said, Master, half of my goods I will give to the poor; and if in anything I have wronged any man, I will restore fourfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said, concerning him, Today is salvation come to this house; inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man is come to seek and recover that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As the people were attentive, he added this parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and they fancied the Reign of God would immediately commence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>A certain nobleman went abroad to procure for himself the royalty, and then return;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>and having called ten of his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, he said, improve these till I return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>Now his citizens hated him; and sending an embassy after him, protested, We will not have this man for our king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>When he returned, vested with royal power, he commanded those servants to be called to whom he had committed the money, that he might know what every one had gained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then the first came, and said, My Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>He answered, Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very small matter, receive the government of ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second who came, said, My Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>He answered, Be you also governor of five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Another came, saying, My Lord, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard master; you exact what you did not give, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He answered, Out of your own mouth, you malignant servant, I will condemn you. Did you know that I am a hard master, exacting what I did not give, and reaping what I did not sow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why, then, did you not put my money into the bank; that at my return I might have received it with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>Then he said to his attendants, Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They answered, My Lord, he has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>He replied, I tell you, that to every one who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me for their king, bring them hither, and slay them in my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>After this discourse, Jesus walked foremost, traveling toward Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, Go to yonder village, where, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever rode; loose him, and bring him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>If any one ask you why you loose him, you shall answer, Because the Master needs him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>Accordingly, they who received this order, went, and found everything as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>As they were loosing the colt, the owners said to them, Why loose you the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>They answered, The Master needs him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>So they brought him to Jesus, and having thrown their mantles upon the colt, set Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>As he went, the people spread their mantles in the way before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>When he was so near as the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God in loud acclamations, for all the miracles which they had seen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying, Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>Upon this, some Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He answered, I tell you, that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>When he came near, and beheld the city, he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>for the days are coming upon thee, when thine enemies will surround thee with a rampart, and inclose thee, and shut thee up on every side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and will level thee with the ground, thee and thy children, and will not leave one stone upon another, because thou didst not know the time when thou wast visited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Afterward he went into the temple, and drove out thence those who sold, and those who bought in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>«saying to them, It is written,'My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he taught daily in the temple, while the chief priests and the scribes, and persons of principal note, sought his destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>but could not devise how to effect it: for all the people heard him with the greatest attention.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good tidings, the chief priests, and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>saying, Tell us by what authority you do these things; or who is he that empowered you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answering, said to them, I also have a question to put to you. Tell me, then,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Was the commission which John had to immerse, from heaven, or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>But they reasoned thus among themselves, If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>And if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>They therefore answered, that they could not tell whence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he spoke to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and farmed it out, and having traveled, continued long abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>The season being come, he sent a servant to the husbandmen, to receive of the produce of the vineyard; but they beat him, and sent him back empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>Afterward, he sent another servant, whom they, having beaten, and used shamefully, also sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>He afterward dispatched a third to them. Him, likewise, they wounded and drove away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the proprietor of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; they will surely reverence him, when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when then husbandmen saw him, they reasoned thus among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And having thrust him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What, therefore, will the proprietor of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And some of his hearers said, God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>«Jesus, looking on them, said, What, then, means that expression of scripture,» 'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>«Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>At that time, the chief priests and the scribes, knowing that he had spoken this parable against them, would have laid hands on him, but feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him, and set spies upon him, instructing them to personate conscientious men, and surprise him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the procurator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>These accosted him with this question, Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach uprightly, and that, without respect of persons, you faithfully recommend the way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Cesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>He perceiving their subtlety, answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Why would you entangle me? Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? They answered, Cesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>He replied, Render, therefore, to Cesar, that which is Cesar's, and to God, that which is God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>Thus they could not surprise him in his discourses before the people; wherefore, admiring his answer, they kept silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Afterward, some of the Sadducees, who deny a future state, came to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>with this question: Rabbi, Moses has enjoined in his writings, that a man whose brother dies childless, outlived by his wife, shall marry the widow, and raise issue to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers; the first of whom, having taken a wife, died childless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>the second married the widow, and also died childless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>the third married her, as did likewise the rest; and all seven died, leaving no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all, the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>To which of them, therefore, will she be wife, at the resurrection; for she had been married to all the seven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jesus answering, said to them, The people of this world marry, and are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but, among them who shall be honored to share in the resurrection, and the other world, there will be neither marrying nor giving in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for they can not die any more; because, like the angels, they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses has suggested, calling the Lord who appeared in the bush, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for they are all alive to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes said to him, Rabbi, you have spoken well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>After that, they did not venture to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, Why is it affirmed that the Messiah must be a son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>«Yet David himself says, in the book of the Psalms,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>«till I make thy foes thy footstool.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>As David thus calls him his Lord, how can he be David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then, in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and affect salutations in public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the families of widows, and make long prayers for a disguise. These shall suffer the severest punishment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>As Jesus was observing the rich casting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>he saw an indigent widow throw in two mites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And he said, I tell you, truly, that this poor widow has cast in more than any of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>for all of these, out of their superfluous store, have thrown into the sacred chest, she has thrown in all the little that she had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>Some having remarked, that the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and presents, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>The time will come, when these things which you behold, shall be razed that one stone will not be left upon another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>Then they asked him, saying, Rabbi, when will these things be: and what will be the sign, when they are about to be accomplished?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>He answered, Take care that you be not seduced: for many will assume my character, saying, I am the person, and the time approaches; therefore, do not follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>But when you shall hear of wars and insurrections, be not terrified: for these things must first happen; but the end will not immediately follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>He added, Then will nation rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there shall be great earthquakes in sundry places, and famines, and pestilences; there shall be also frightful appearances, and great prodigies in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>But, before all this, you shall be apprehended and prosecuted, and delivered to synagogues, and imprisoned, and dragged before kings and governors, because of my name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>and this afford scope for your testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>Be, therefore, resolved not to premeditate what defense you shall make;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>for I will give you an utterance, and wisdom, which none of your adversaries shall be able to refute or resist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>And you shall be given up even by parents, and brothers, and kinsmen, and friends; and some of you will be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And, on my account, you shall be universally hated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>Yet not a hair of your head shall be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>Save your souls by your perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>Now, when you shall see Jerusalem invested with armies, know that its desolation is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; let those in the city make their escape, and let not those in the country enter the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.22'>for these will be days of vengeance, in which all the denunciations of the scriptures shall be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>But, alas, for the women with child, and for them who give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>They shall fall by the sword; they shall be carried captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth, the anguish of desponding nations; and roarings in the seas, and floods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>men expiring with the fear and apprehension of those things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>Then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great glory and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>Now when these things begin to be fulfilled, look up, and lift up your heads; because your deliverance approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>He proposed to them, also, this comparison: Consider the fig tree, and the other trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>When you observe them shooting forth, you know, of yourselves, that the summer is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>Know, in like manner, when you shall see these events, that the Reign of God is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>Indeed, I say to you, that this race shall not fail until all be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>Heaven and earth shall fail; but my words shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares: for, as a net,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>it shall inclose all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Be vigilant, therefore, praying on every occasion, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these approaching evils, and to stand before the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>Thus Jesus taught in the temple by day, but retired at night to the mountain, called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.38'>And every morning the people resorted early to the temple to hear him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the feast of unleavened bread, called the passover, being near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And he went and concerted with the chief priests and officers, how he might deliver Jesus into their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed to give him a certain sum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>which Judas having accepted, watched an opportunity to deliver him up without tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Now, this day of unleavened bread being come, on which the passover must be sacrificed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They asked him, Where shall we prepare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He answered, When you enter the city, you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he shall enter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>and say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished; make ready there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went, and having found everything as he had told them, prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the hour was come, he placed himself at table with the twelve Apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>and said to them, Much have I longed to eat this passover with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>that I will never partake of another, until it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then, taking a cup, he gave thanks, and said, Take this, and share it amongst you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>for I assure you, that I will not again drink of the product of the vine, until the Reign of God be come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>Then he took bread, and having given thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in commemoration of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>He likewise gave the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new Institution in my blood, which is shed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>Mark, however, that the hand of him who betrays me, is on the table with mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>The Son of Man is going away, as has been determined: nevertheless, alas, for that man by whom he is betrayed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Then they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that would do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There had been, also, a contention amongst them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>And he said to them, The king of the nations exercise dominion over them; and they who oppress them, are styled benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But with you, it must be otherwise: nay, let the greatest amongst you be as the least; and him who governs, as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For, which is greater, he who is at table, or he who serves? Is not he that is at table? Yet I am amongst you as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You are they who have continued with me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I grant to you, (forasmuch as my Father has granted me a kingdom,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>to eat, and to drink at my table, in my kingdom, and to sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>The Lord said, also, Simon, Simon, Satan has obtained permission to sift you as wheat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not; do you, therefore, when you have recovered yourself, confirm your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>He answered, Master, I am ready to accompany you, both to prison, and to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jesus replied, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow today, before you have thrice denied that you know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Then he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and bag, and shoes, did you want anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>But now, said he, let him that has a purse, take it, and likewise his bag; and let him who has no sword, sell his mantle, and buy one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>«for I tell you that this scripture,» 'He was ranked among malefactors,' 'is now to be accomplished in me: for the things relating to me must be fulfilled.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>They said, Master, here are two swords. He replied, It is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then he went out, and repaired, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>Being arrived there, he said to them, Pray that you may not yield to temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>Then, being withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; he kneeled down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, Father, if thou wilt, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in an agony of grief, he prayed the more fervently, and his sweat fell like clotted blood to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>Having risen from prayer, and returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping, oppressed with grief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>and said to them, Why do you sleep? Arise, and pray, lest the trial overcome you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>Before he had done speaking, he saw a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, walked before them, and came up to Jesus, to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Now, those who were with him, foreseeing what would happen, said to him, Master, shall we strike with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Jesus said, Let this suffice; and touching his ear, he healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and the officers of the temple-guard, and the elders, who were come to apprehend him, Do you come with swords and clubs, as in pursuit of a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not attempt to arrest me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Then they seized him, and led him away to the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and were sitting round it, Peter sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a maid servant, having observed him sitting by the fire, and viewed him attentively, said, This man also was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he disowned him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>A little while after, another seeing him, said, You, also, are one of them. Peter answered, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour after, another averred the same thing, saying, This man was surely with him, for he is a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Peter answered, Man, I know nothing of this matter. And just as he spoke the word, a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>Then the Lord, turning, looked upon Peter, and Peter called to mind the word which the Lord had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will disown me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Meantime, they who had Jesus in charge, mocked and beat him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and having blindfolded him, struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Divine who it is that smote you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other abusive things they said against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as it was day, the national senate, with the chief priests and scribes, were assembled, and having caused him to be brought into their council-chamber, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>If you be the Messiah, tell us. He answered, If I tell you, you will not believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if put a question, you will neither answer me, nor acquit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Hereafter the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>They all replied, You are, then, the Son of God? He answered, You say the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>Then they cried, What further need have we of evidence? We have heard enough ourselves, from his own mouth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And the assembly broke up, and conducted Jesus to Pilate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>and they accused him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, calling himself Messiah the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate, asking him, said, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitude, I find nothing criminal in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they became more vehement, adding, He raised sedition among the people, by the doctrine which he spread through all Judea, from Galilee, where he began, to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard them mention Galilee, he asked, whether the man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And finding that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also then at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And Herod was very glad to see Jesus: it was what he had long desired; having heard much of him, and hoping to see him perform some miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He, therefore, asked him many questions, but Jesus returned him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Yet the chief priests and the scribes, who were present, accused him with eagerness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>But Herod and his military train despised him: and having, in derision, arrayed him in a splendid robe, remanded him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>On that day, Pilate and Herod became friends; for, before, they had been at enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate, having convened the chief priests, the magistrates and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, You have brought this man before me, as one who excites the people to revolt; yet, having examined him in your presence, I have not found him guilt of any of those crimes of which you accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>Neither has Herod; for I referred you to him. Be assured, then, that he has done nothing to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>For it was necessary that he should release one to them at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>Then all cried out together, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for raising sedition in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, willing to release Jesus, again, expostulated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried, saying, Crucify! crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>A third time he repeated, Why? What evil has this man done? I do not find him guilty of any capital crime; I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they persisted, demanding, with much clamor, that he might be crucified. At last, their clamors, and those of the chief priests, prevailed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>and Pilate pronounced sentence, that it should be as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>Accordingly, he released a man who had been imprisoned for sedition and murder; whom they required; and gave up Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>As they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude followed him, amongst whom were many women, who lamented and bewailed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>for the days are coming, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, the wombs which never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they shall cry to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>for if it fare thus with the green tree, how shall it fare with the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two malefactors were also led with him to execution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they came to the place called Calvary, they there nailed him to a cross, and the malefactors also; one at his right hand, the other at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments by lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>While the people stood gazing, even their rulers joined them in ridiculing him, and saying, This man saved others; let him save himself, if he be the Messiah, the elect of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers likewise mocked him, coming and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If you be the King of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was also an inscription over his head in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Now, one of the malefactors who suffered with him, reviled him, saying, If you be the Messiah, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>The other, rebuking him, answered, Have you no fear of God, you who are undergoing the same punishment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest to thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And, about the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land, which lasted till the ninth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus said with a loud voice, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and having thus said, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Then, the centurion, observing what had happened, gave glory to God; saying, Assuredly, this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>Nay, all the people who were present at this spectacle, and saw what had passed, returned, beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, standing at a distance, beheld these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now, there was a senator, named Joseph, a good and just man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>from Arimathea, a city of Judea, who had not concurred in the resolutions and proceedings of the rest; and who himself, also expected the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut in stone, in which no man had ever been deposited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>Now that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, followed Joseph, and observed the tomb, and how the body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>When they returned, they provided spices and ointments, and then rested the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But the first day of the week, they went by daybreak, with some others, to the tomb, carrying the spices which they had provided,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>and found the stone rolled away from the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and having entered, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were in perplexity on this account, behold, two men stood by them, in robes of a dazzling brightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>The women being affrighted, and fixing their eyes on the ground, these said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke to you, before he left Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>On their return from the tomb, they reported the whole matter to the eleven, and to all the other disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told these things to the Apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>but their account appeared to them as idle tales; they gave them no credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Peter, however, arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, saw nothing there but the linen lying. And he went away, musing with astonishment on what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>The same day, as two of the disciples were traveling to a village named Emmaus, sixty furlongs from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>they conversed together about all these events.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>While they were conversing and reasoning, Jesus himself joined them, and went along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were so affected that they did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What subjects are these about which you confer together? and why are you dejected?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, named Cleopas, answered, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do you not know the things which have happened there so lately?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>What things? said he. They answered, Concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet, powerful in word and deed, before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>how our chief priests and magistrates have delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>As for us, we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. Besides all this, today, being the third day since these things happened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>some women of our company have astonished us; for having gone early to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and not found his body, they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of our men went to the tomb, and found matters exactly as the women had related; but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them, O thoughtless men, and backward to believe things which have been all predicted by the prophets!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not the Messiah thus to suffer, and so to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Then beginning with Moses, and proceeding through all the prophets, he explained to them all the passages relating to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>When they came near the village, whither they were traveling, he seemed as intending to go farther;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>but they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it grows late, and the day is far spent. And he went to abide with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>While they were at table together, he took the loaf, and blessed and broke it, and distributed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he disappeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us on the road, and expounded to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>Immediately they arose and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven, and the rest of their company assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>who said, The Master is actually risen, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>These also recounted what had happened on the road, and how he was made known to them in breaking the loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they discoursed in this manner, he stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were amazed and affrighted, imagining that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are you so alarmed? And wherefore do suspicious arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet; it is I myself; handle me and be convinced; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While yet they believed not, for joy and amazement, he said to them, Have you here anything to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>which he took and eat in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, This is what I told you while I remained with you, that all the things which are written of me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that reformation and the remission of sins should be proclaimed, in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>Now, you are witnesses of these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>and behold I send you that which my Father has promised; but do you continue in this city, until you be invested with power from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>He then led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And having worshiped him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God.</verse>
