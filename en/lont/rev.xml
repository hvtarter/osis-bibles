      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>A revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants the things which must shortly be; and sending by his messenger, he signified them to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Happy is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it; for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven congregation which are in Asia; favor and peace be with you, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth; to him who has loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has made us kings and priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he is coming in the clouds; and every eye shall see him, even they who pierced him: and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of him. Yes: so let it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, who am also your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard a great voice behind me, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven congregations; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice which spoke to me, and being turned, I saw seven golden lamps;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and, in the midst of the seven lamps, one like a Son of Man, clothed in a long robe, and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head, even his hairs, were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet like fine brass, when glowing in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>and he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth there went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun, when he shines in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell down at his feet, as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, and said, Fear not; I am the First and the Last;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am he who lives and was dead; and behold, I am living for ever and ever; and I have the keys of the unseen world, and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write the things which you see, even those which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>As to the hidden meaning of the seven stars, which you see in my right hand, and of the seven lamps of gold: the seven stars are messengers of the seven congregations; and the seven lamps which you see, are seven congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>By the messenger of the congregation in Ephesus, write: These things, says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works, and your labor, and your patience; and that you can not bear those who are evil: and you have tried those who say they are Apostles, and are not, and have found them liars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and you have patience; and have borne for my name's sake, and have not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless, I have against you that you have lost your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember, therefore, from what you are fallen, and reform, and do the first works, otherwise I will come to you quickly, and take away your lamp out of its place, unless you reform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>Yet you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who conquers, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And by the messenger of the congregation in Smyrna, write: These things, says the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich,) and I know the slander of those who say they are Jews, and are not; but are the assembly of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of the things which you shall suffer; behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful until death, and I will give you a crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. The conqueror shall not be injured by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And by the messenger of the congregation which is in Pergamos, write: These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know your works, and where you dwell; even where the throne of Satan is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you, that you have there, them who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>You, in like manner, have those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Reform, or otherwise, I will come to you quickly, and I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations: To the conqueror I will give of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And by the messenger of the congregation in Thyatira, write: These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and your patience, and that your last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Nevertheless, I have against you, that you permit that woman Jezebel, who says that she is a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I have given her time to reform from her fornication, and she reforms not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they reform from their works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>and I will say her children with death; and all the congregations shall know that I am he who search the reins and the heart; and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But I say to you, even to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not hold this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will lay upon you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Nevertheless, what you have, hold fast till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And as for him that conquers, and keeps my works to the end, I will give him power over the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, they shall be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel: as I have also received of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And by the messenger of the congregation in Sardis, write: These things says he who has the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you live, but are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die: for I have not found your works filled up in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember, therefore, how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and reform: therefore, unless you are watchful, I will come upon you as thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few names in Sardis, who have not polluted their garments: and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>As for the conqueror, he shall be clothed in white apparel; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And by the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia, write: These things says the Holy One, the True One; who has the key, the Son of David; he who opens and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it; because you have little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will give of those-who are of the assembly of Satan; who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold-I will make them to come and worship before your feet; and they shall know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the word of my patience, I will also keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly: keep that which you have, that no man take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>As for the conqueror, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will inscribe upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is to come down from heaven, from my God; and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And by the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea, write: These things says the AMEN, the Faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I wish you were either cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Therefore, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, I am wealthy, and have enriched myself, and have need of nothing; and do not know that you are wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white apparel, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I reprove and correct; therefore, be zealous, and reform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will enter into his house, and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>As for the conqueror, I will give him to sit down with me upon my throne; as I also have conquered, and sat down with my Father upon his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things, I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet speaking to me; and it said, Come up hither, and I will show you what shall be hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting upon it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>and he who sat on it, was in appearance like a jasper and sardine stone; and a rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, was round about the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne there were twenty-four thrones; and on the thrones, twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white apparel; and upon their heads golden crowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne there came lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the middle of the throne, in the circle about the throne, there were four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first creature was like a lion; and the second creature was like a calf; and the third creature had a face like a man; and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures had, each of them, six wings round about; and within they were full of eyes: and they rest not, day or night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who wast, and art, and art to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And while the living creatures are giving glory, and honor, and thanks to him who sits upon the throne, who lives for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits upon the throne, who lives for ever and ever; and they cast down their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a scroll written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a mighty messenger proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And one in heaven, nor upon the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the scroll, or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept abundantly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, nor to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders said to me, Weep not; behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I beheld, in the middle space, between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, there stood a Lamb, which seemed to have been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes; these are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of him who sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he received the scroll, the four living creatures, and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one harps, and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sung a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the scroll, and to open the seals of it; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and hast made us, to our God, kings and priests: and we shall reign on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I beheld, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and of the living creatures, and of the elders: and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying, with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, even all things that are in them, I heard saying, To him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, and honor, and glory, and strength, for ever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures said, Amen: and the elders fell down and worshiped him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures, which said, as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon it, had a bow, and there was given him a crown; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature, saying, Come-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out, which was red; and it was given to him who sat upon it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay each other; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature, saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat upon it, has a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A chenix of wheat for a denarius, and three chenices of barley for a denarius; you see that you injure not the oil, nor the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature, saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw, and behold, a pale horse; and as for him who sat on it, his name was Death; and Hades followed him: and there was given to him power to slay the fourth part of the earth with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth sea, I saw, under the altar, the souls of those who were slaughtered on account of the word of God, and the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a loud voice, and said, How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, before thou dost judge, and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there were given to each of them white robes; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet a while, till the number of their fellow-servants and brethren who should be killed, as they had been, should be completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw, when he opened the sixth seal, and there was an earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair; and the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars fell from heaven, on the earth, as fig tree drops its untimely figs, being shaken by a mighty wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>and the heavens passed away like a scroll, when it is rolled up; and every mountain, and island, was moved out of its place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>and the kings of the earth, and the grandees, and the rich men, and the chief officers, and the powerful men, and every slave, and every freeman, hid themselves in the caves, and rocks of the mountains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and they said to the mountains, and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And, after these things, I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind might not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the rising sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom power was given to injure the earth, and the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Injure not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God, in their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those that were sealed: one hundred and forty-four thousand, who were sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad, were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh, were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, issuing out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the midst of the broad street, and on each side of the river, was the tree of life, producing twelve kinds of fruit- producing its fruit in every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And every curse shall cease. And the throne of God, and of the Lamb, shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they shall see his face: and his name shall be borne upon their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there shall be no more night; and they have no need of a lamp, nor of the light of the sun; because the Lord God shall enlighten them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets, has sent his holy angel to show his servants what must quickly be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, saw and heard these things, and when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he said to me, See you do it not: I am a fellow-servant with you, and of your brethren, the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book: worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>Let him that is unjust, be unjust still; and let him that is polluted, be polluted still; and let him that is righteous, be righteous still; and let him that is holy, be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me: I will recompense to every man according as his works shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega-the Beginning and the End: the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>(Happy are they who keep his commandments, that they may have the privilege to eat of the tree of life; and they shall enter by the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who loves and invents a lie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you, in the congregations. I am the Root and the Offspring of David; the bright and the Morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come: and let him that hears, say, Come: and let him that is thirsty, come: whoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>And I testify of every one that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>and if any one take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city-the things which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who testifies these things, says, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>May the favor of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints!</verse>
