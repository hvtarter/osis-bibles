      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The History of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah had Pharez and Zarah by Tamar. Pharez begot Ezrom. Ezrom begot Aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Aram begot Aminidab. Aminidab begot Nashon. Nashon begot Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon had Boaz by Rahab. Boaz had Obed by Ruth. Obed begot Jesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse begot David the king. David the king had Solomon, by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abia. Abia begot Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa begot Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begot Joram. Joram begot Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah begot Jotham. Jotham begot Ahaz. Ahaz begot Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah begot Manasseh. Manasseh begot Amon. Amon begot Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah had Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the migration into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the migration into Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel. Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel begot Abiud. Abiud begot Eliakim. Eliakim begot Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor begot Zadoc. Zadoc begot Achim. Achim begot Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud begot Eleazar. Eleazar begot Matthan. Matthan begot Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon, fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened thus: Mary his mother had been espoused to Joseph; but before they came together, she proved to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph her husband being a virtuous man, and unwilling to expose her, intended to divorce her privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking upon this, an angel of the Lord appearing to him in a dream, said, Joseph, son of David, scruple not to take home Mary your wife; for her pregnancy is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>In all this what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet was verified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>«Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, who shall be called Immanuel;» 'which signifies, God with us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph awoke, he did as the messenger of the Lord had commanded him, and took home his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but knew her not, until she had brought forth her first born son, whom he named Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>After the birth of Jesus, at Bethlehem of Judea, in the reign of King Herod, certain eastern magicians came to Jerusalem, and inquired,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is the new-born King of the Jews; for we have seen his star in the east country, and are coming to do him homage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>King Herod hearing this, was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having assembled all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he demanded of them where the Messiah should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They answered, at Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>«And thou Bethlehem, in the canton of Judah, are not the least illustrious among the cities of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who will govern my people Israel.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod having secretly called the magicians, procured from them exact information concerning the time of the star's appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, make an exact inquiry about the child; and when you have found him bring me word, that I may go also, and pay him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>Having heard the King, they departed; and lo! the star which had appeared to them in the east country, moved before them, till it came, and stood over the place, where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they again saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And being come into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother; and, prostrating themselves, did him homage. Then opening their caskets, they offered, as presents to him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went home another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>When they were gone, lo! a messenger of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, said, Arise, take the child with his mother, and flee into Egypt; and remain there till I order you; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Accordingly he arose, took the child with his mother, and withdrew by night into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>«where he continued until the death of Herod; so that, what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, was verified,» 'Out of Egypt I called my Son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, finding that he had been deceived by the magicians, was highly incensed and dispatched emissaries who slew, by his order, all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its territory, from those entering the second year, down to the time of which he had procured exact information from the magicians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>«A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and bitter complaint: Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appearing in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Arise, take the child with his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Accordingly, he arose, took the child with his mother, and came to the land of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>but hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod in the throne of Judea, he was afraid to return thither; and being warned in a dream, retired into the district of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and resided in a city named Nazareth; in this verifying the declarations of the Prophet concerning Jesus, that he should be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days appeared John the Immerser, who proclaimed in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>«For this is he, of whom the Prophet Isaiah speaks in these words,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John wore raiment of camel's hair with a letter girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country along the Jordan, resorted to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But he seeing many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to receive immersion, said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Produce, then, the proper fruit of reformation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and presume not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, immerse you in water, into reformation; but he who comes after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit, and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather his wheat into the granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to be immersed by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John excused himself, saying, It is I who need to be immersed by you; and you come to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Jesus answering, said to him, Permit this at present; for thus ought we to ratify every institution. Then John acquiesced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Jesus being immersed, no sooner arose out of the water, than heaven was opened to him; and the Spirit of God appeared, descending like a dove, and lighting upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>while a voice from heaven proclaimed, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus conducted by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>Then the tempter accosting him, said, If thou be God's Son, command that these stones become loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>«Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Man lives not by bread only, but by everything which God is pleased to appoint.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil conveyed him into the holy city, and having placed him on the battlement of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>«said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down; for it is written,» 'He will give his angels the charge of thee: they shall uphold thee in their arms, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>«Jesus again answered, It is written,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil took him up a very high mountain, whence he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt prostrate thyself, and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>«Jesus answered, Satan, begone; for it is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord they God, and shall serve him only.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaving him, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now Jesus, hearing that John was imprisoned, retired into Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, resided at Capernaum, a seaport in the confines of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>thereby verifying the words of Isaiah the Prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>«The canton of Zebulun and the canton of Naphtali, situate on the Jordan near the sea, Galilee of the nations;»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who abode in darkness, saw a great light, and on those who inhabited a region of the shades of death, light has arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to proclaim, saying, Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Then walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon named Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Immediately they left the nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Passing on he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the bark with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They immediately, leaving the bark and their father, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Then Jesus went over all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every sort of disease and malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame spread through all Syria, and they brought him all their sick, seized and tormented with various distempers, demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And vast multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the banks of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Jesus, seeing so great a confluence, repaired to a mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>Then breaking silence, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Happy the poor who repine not; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Happy they who mourn; for they shall receive consolation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Happy the meek; for they shall inherit the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Happy they who hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Happy the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Happy the pure in heart; for they shall see God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Happy the peace-makers; for they shall be called sons of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Happy they who suffer persecution on account of righteousness; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Happy shall you be, when men shall revile and persecute you; and, on my account, accuse you falsely of every evil thing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and exult, for great is your reward in heaven; for thus the Prophets were persecuted, who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth. If the salt become insipid, how shall its saltness be restored? It is thenceforth fit only to be cast out, and trod under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city situate on a mountain must be conspicuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>A lamp is lighted to be put, not under a vessel, but on a stand, that it may shine to all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus, let your light shine before men, that they, seeing your good actions, may glorify your Father, who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to subvert the law or the prophets. I am come not to subvert, but to ratify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For, indeed, I say to you, heaven and earth shall sooner perish, than one iota, or on tittle of the law shall perish, without attaining its end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever, therefore, shall violate, or teach others to violate, were it the least of these commandments, shall be in no esteem in the Reign of Heaven; but whosoever shall practice and teach them, shall be highly esteemed in the Reign of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness excel the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>«You have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not commit murder; for whosoever commits murder shall be obnoxious to the judges.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, whosoever is angry with his brother unjustly, shall be obnoxious to the judges; whosoever shall call him fool, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall call him miscreant, shall be obnoxious to hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there recollect, that your brother has ground to complain of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there your gift before the altar: first go and procure reconciliation with your brother; then come, and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Compound speedily with your creditor, while you are on the road together; lest he deliver you to the judge; and the judge consign you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Indeed, I say to you, you will not be released, until you have discharged the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall not commit adultery.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, whoever looks on another man's wife, in order to cherish impure desire, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>Therefore, if your right eye ensnare you, pluck it out, and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>«It has been said,'Whosoever would dismiss his wife, let him give her a writ of divorce.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, whosoever shall dismiss his wife, except for whoredom, is the occasion of her becoming an adulteress; and whosoever marries her that is dismissed, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>«Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither shall you swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>not by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your yes, be Yes; your no, No; for whatever exceeds these, proceeds from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>«You have heard that it was said,'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, contend not with the injurious. But if any one strike you on the right cheek, turn to him also the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>Whoever will sue you for your coat, let him have your mantle likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And if a man constrain you to go one mile with him, go two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asks you; and him that would borrow from you, put not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies; bless them who curse you; do good to them who hate you; and pray for them who arraign and persecute you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may be children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun arise on bad and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love them only who love you, what reward can you expect? Do not even the publicans so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you salute your brothers only, wherein do you excel? Do not even the Pagans as much?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Be you therefore perfect, as your father who is in heaven is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that you perform not your religious duties before men, in order to be observed by them; otherwise you will obtain no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>When, therefore, you give alms, do not proclaim it by sound of trumpet, as the hypocrites do, in the assemblies and in the streets, that they may be extolled by men. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But you, when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that your alms may be in secret; and your Father, to whom nothing is secret, will himself recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites, who affect to pray standing in the assemblies, and at the corners of the streets, that men may observe them. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you would pray, retire to your closet; and having shut the door, pray to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And in prayer, use not a multiplicity of words as the Pagans do, who think that using many words will gain them acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Imitate them not; for your Father knows what things you want, before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Thus, therefore, pray you: Our Father, who art in heaven, thy name be hallowed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>thy Reign come; thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>give us today our daily bread;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>and lead us not into temptation, but preserve us from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>but if you forgive not others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>Moreover, when you fast, look not dismal, as the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces, that men may observe that they fast. Indeed, I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>that your fasting may not appear to men, but to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Amass not for yourselves treasure upon the earth, where moths and rust may consume it, or thieves breaking in may steal it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But provide for yourselves treasure in heaven, where are neither moths nor rust to consume it, nor thieves to break in and steal it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, your heart will also be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The eye is the lamp of the body. If, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be enlightened;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>A man can not serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or at least he will attend to one, and neglect the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall wear. Is not life a greater gift than food; and the body more than raiment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Observe the fowls of heaven. They neither sow nor reap. They have no storehouse; but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you much more valuable than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Besides, which of you can, by his anxiety, prolong his life one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about raiment? Mark the lilies of the field. How do they grow? They toil not: they spin not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>Yet I affirm that even Solomon in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>If, then, God so array the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow will be cast into the oven, will he not much more array you, O you distrustful!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore say not anxiously, (as the heathens do,) What shall we eat; or what shall we drink; or with what shall we be clothed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness required by him; and all these things shall be superadded to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not then anxious about the morrow: the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for every day is its own trouble.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>Being come down from the mountain, followed by a great multitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>a leper came, who, presenting himself before him, said, Sir, if you will, you can cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Then Jesus said to him, See you tell no person; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make the oblation prescribed by Moses, for notifying the cure to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Having entered Capernaum, a centurion accosted him with this request,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>Sir, my man-servant lies sick at home, exceedingly afflicted with a palsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus answered, I will go and cure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion replying, said, Sir, I am not worthy, that you should come under my roof; only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For even I, who am under command myself, having soldiers under me, say to one, Go, and he goes; to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>Jesus hearing this, was astonished, and said to those who followed, Indeed, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>But I assure you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and will be placed at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>while the sons of the kingdom shall be thrust out into outer darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go home; be it to you, according to your faith. That instant his servant was cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Then Jesus having entered Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>and having touched her hand, the fever left her; on which she arose and entertained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>In the evening they presented to him many demoniacs; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and cured all the sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>«thus verifying the saying of the Prophet Isaiah,» 'He has himself carried off our infirmities, and borne our distresses.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Jesus seeing himself crowded on all sides, gave orders to pass to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>Meantime, a scribe accosted him, saying, Rabbi, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter, but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Another, one of his disciples, said to him, Master, permit me to go first, and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>Jesus answered, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Then entering the bark, his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>Soon after there arose in the sea so great a tempest, that the bark was covered with billows. But he being asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>the disciples came and waked him, saying, Save us, Master, we perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>He answered, Why are you so timorous, O you distrustful? Then he arose, and having commanded the winds and the sea, a great calm ensued;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>insomuch that every one exclaimed with admiration, What personage is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>When he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs, issuing out of the monuments, so furious, that no person durst pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>These instantly cried, saying, What hast thou to do with us, Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was feeding, at some distance, a great herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>And the friends besought him, saying, If thou expel us, permit us to go into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>He answered, Go. And when they were cast out, they went into the swine; on which the whole herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Then the herdsmen fled into the city, and reported everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>Presently the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and having seen him, entreated him to depart out of their territory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Then having gone aboard the bark, he repassed, and went to his own city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>where they brought to him a paralytic, laid upon a bed. Jesus perceiving their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>On which some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus knowing their sentiments, said, Why do you harbor evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>Which is easier-to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, with effect -Arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins; Arise, then, (said he to the paralytic,) take up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>Accordingly he arose, and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>And the people saw and wondered, glorifying God, who had given such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>As Jesus departed thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the toll office; to whom he said, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Afterward Jesus being at table in a house, many publicans and sinners came, and placed themselves with him and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>Some of the Pharisees observing this, said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>Jesus hearing them, answered, The whole need not a physician, but the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>«Go, therefore, and learn what this means,» 'I desire humanity, and not sacrifice:' 'for I came to call, not the righteous, but sinners.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then John's disciples addressing him, said, We and the Pharisees often fast: why do your disciples never fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus answered, Can the bridesmen mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No person mends an old garment with undressed cloth; else the patch itself tears the garment, and makes a greater rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Neither do people put new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise the bottles burst: and thus, both the wine is spilt, and the bottles are rendered useless. But they put new wine into new bottles, and bother are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While he was speaking, a ruler came, and prostrating himself, said, My daughter is by this time dead; but come, and lay your hand upon her, and she will revive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus arose, and, as he followed him, with his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with a bloody issue, coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said within herself, If I but touch his mantle, I shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turning about, saw her, and said, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you. And the woman was well from that instant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>Being come into the ruler's house, and seeing the players on the flute, with the crowd, making a bustle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said to them, Withdraw, for the young woman is not dead, but asleep. And they derided him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>but when the people were put out, he entered, and having taken her by the hand, the young woman arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>Now the fame of this action spread through all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>When Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, Son of David, have pity upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>Being come into the house, the blind men approached him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe I can do this? They answered, Yes, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it to you according to your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>Immediately their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charging them, said, Take care that no person know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But being departed, they spread his fame through all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>They were scarcely gone, when a dumb demoniac was presented to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>The demon being expelled, the dumb spoke, and the people wondered, saying, Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, He expels the demons by the prince of the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Then Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every disease and every malady.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>But when he saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they were scattered and exposed, like a flock without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>entreat, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power to expel unclean spirits, and to cure diseases and maladies of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: The first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.13'>Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And as he stretched it out, it became sound like the other.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.39'>He answering, said to them, An evil and adulterous race demands a sign; but no sign shall be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.40'>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the bosom of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.42'>The Queen of the South country will arise in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wise discourses of Solomon; and behold here something greater than Solomon.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.13'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.1'>The same day, Jesus having gone out of the house, sat by the sea-side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.2'>but so great a multitude flocked about him, that he went into a bark, and sat down there, while all the people stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.3'>Then he discoursed to them of many things in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.4'>The sower, said he, went out to sow; and, in sowing, some seeds fell by the way-side, and the birds came and picked them up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>some fell on rocky ground, where they had but little earth: these sprang up the sooner, because the soil had no depth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.6'>but after the sun had beat upon them, they were scorched, and having no root, withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>Others fell into good ground, and yielded increase, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>Then the disciples addressed him, saying, Why do you speak to them in parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.11'>He answering, said to them, Because it is your privilege, and not theirs, to know the secrets of the Reign of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.12'>For to him that has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>For this reason I speak to them in parables; because they seeing, see not; and hearing, hear not, nor regard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>«insomuch that this prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them,» 'You will indeed hear, but will not understand; you will look, but will not perceive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.15'>«For this people's understanding is stupefied, their ears are deafened, and their eyes they have closed; lest seeing with their eyes, hearing with their ears, and apprehending with their understanding, they should reform, and I should reclaim them.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>For, indeed, I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see, but have not seen them; and to hear the things which you hear, but have not heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>Understand you, therefore, the parable of the sower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>When one hears the doctrine of the Reign, but considers it not, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which was sown in his heart. This explains what fell by the way-side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.20'>That which fell on rocky ground, denotes him who, hearing the word, receives it at first with pleasure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.21'>yet, not having it rooted in his mind, retains it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes, because of the word, instantly he relapses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>That which fell among thorns, denotes that hearer in whom worldly cares, and deceitful riches, choke the word, and render it unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>But that which fell into good soil, and bore fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold, denotes him, who not only hears and considers, but obeys the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a field, in which the proprietor has sown good grain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>but while people were asleep, his enemy came, and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.26'>When the blade was up, and putting forth the ear, then appeared also the darnel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.27'>And the servants came, and said to their master, Sir, you sowed good grain in your field; whence, then, has it darnel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.28'>He answered, An enemy has done this. They said, Will you, then, that we weed them out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>He replied, No, lest in weeding out the darnel, you tear up the wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, first gather the darnel, and make them into bundles for burning; then carry the wheat into my barn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another similitude he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man planted in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>for though it is the smallest of seeds, when grown, larger than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air take the shelter in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another similitude he gave them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these similitudes Jesus spoke to the people; for he taught them only by similitudes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>«in this verifying the word of the Prophet,» 'I will discourse in parables; I will utter things concerning which, all antiquity has been silent.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jesus, leaving the multitude, retired to the house, where his disciples accosted him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>Jesus answering, said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the conclusion of this state; and the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>As, therefore, the darnel is gathered and burnt, so shall it be at the conclusion of this state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send his angels who shall gather out of his kingdom all seducers and iniquitous persons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and throw them into the burning furnace: weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then shall the righteous shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which, when a man has discovered, he conceals the discovery, and for joy thereof, sells all that he has, and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl extremely precious, which a merchant, in quest of fine pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.46'>having found, sold all that he had, and purchased it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep-net cast into the seam which encloses fish of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>When it is full, they draw it ashore, and gather the good into vessels, but throw the useless away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>So it shall be at the conclusion of this state. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.50'>and throw them into the burning furnace. Weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.51'>Jesus said, Do you understand all these things? They answered, Yes, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.52'>He added, Every scribe, therefore, instructed for the Reign of Heaven, is like a householder, who brings out of his storehouse new things and old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>And after he had finished these similitudes, he departed thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>Jesus being come into his own country, taught the inhabitants in their synagogue; and they said with astonishment, Whence has this man this wisdom, and this power of working miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.55'>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And do not his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.56'>and all his sisters, live amongst us? Whence, then, has he all these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>Thus they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and in his own family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.58'>And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.14'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.1'>At that time, Herod the tetrarch, hearing of the fame of Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had caused John to be apprehended, imprisoned, and bound, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>for John had said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And Herod would have put him to death, but was afraid of the populace, who accounted him a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>And his head was brought in a basin, and presented to the young woman; and she carried it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>After which, his disciples went and brought the body, and having buried it, came and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>When Jesus heard this, he embarked privately; and retired into a desert place; of which the people being informed followed him by land out of the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>Observing, as he landed, a great multitude, he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>Toward the evening, his disciples accosted him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past, dismiss the multitude, that they may go to the villages; and buy themselves provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>Jesus answered, They need not go. Supply them yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>They said to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>He replied, Bring them hither to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>Then having commanded the people to recline upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking toward heaven, blessed them; then breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now they that had eat were about five thousand men; besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Immediately he obliged the disciples to embark and pass over before him, while he dismissed the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>Having dismissed the multitude, he retired by himself to a mountain to pray, and remained there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>By that time the bark was half way over, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, being terrified, they exclaimed, An apparition! and cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>Peter answering, said to him, If it be you, Master, bid me to come to you on the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.29'>Jesus said, Come. Then Peter getting out of the bark, walked on the water toward Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But finding the wind boisterous, he was frightened; and beginning to sink, cried, Master, save me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>Jesus instantly stretching out his hand, caught him; and said to him, Distrustful man, wherefore did you doubt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>When they had gone aboard, the wind ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those in the bark came, and prostrated themselves before him, saying, You are assuredly God's son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>Having passed over, they landed on the territory of Gennesaret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>the inhabitants of which knowing him, sent through all that country, and brought to him all the diseased,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.36'>who besought him to let them touch but a tuft of his mantle; and as man as touched were cured.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.15'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.1'>Then some Scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem addressed him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.2'>Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders; for they was not their hands before meals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jesus answering, said to them, Why do you yourselves by your tradition, transgress the commandment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>«For God has commanded, saying,'Honor father and mother'; and'Whosoever reviles father or mother, let him be punished with death.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you affirm, If a man say to father or mother, I devote whatever of mine shall profit you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>he shall not afterward honor by his assistance, his father or his mother. Thus, by your tradition, you annul the commandment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>Hypocrites, well do you suit the character which Isaiah gave of you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.8'>«This people honor me with their lips. though their heart is estranged from me.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.9'>«But in vain they worship me, while they teach institutions merely human.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>Then, having called the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and be instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.11'>It is not what goes into the mouth pollutes the man; but it is what proceeds out of the mouth, that pollutes the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>On which his disciples accosting him, said, Did you observe how the Pharisees, when they heard that saying were offended?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>He answered, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be extirpated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.14'>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>Then Peter addressing him, said, Explain to us that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>Jesus answered, Are you also void of understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.17'>Do you not apprehend, that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach, and is thrown out into the sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But that which proceeds out of the mouth, issues from the heart, and so pollutes the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>For out of the heart proceed malicious contrivances, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, calumnies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These are the things which pollute the man; but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Then Jesus withdrew into the confines of Tyre and Sidon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>and behold! a Canaanitish woman of these territories came to him, crying, Master, Son of David, have pity on me; my daughter is grievously afflicted by a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he gave her no answer. Then his disciples interposed, and entreated him, saying, Dismiss her, for she clamors after us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>He answering said, My mission is only to the lost sheep of the stock of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.25'>She, nevertheless, advanced, and prostrating herself before him, said, O Lord, help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>He replied, It is not seemly to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>True, Sir, returned she. Yet even the dogs are allowed the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman! great is your faith. Be it to you as you desire. And that instant her daughter was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>Jesus having left that place, came nigh to the sea of Galilee, and repaired to a mountain, where he sat down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>and great multitudes flocked to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the cripple, and several others, whom they laid at his feet; and he healed them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>insomuch that the people beheld, with admiration, the dumb speaking, the cripple sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>Then Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude because they have now attended me three days, and have nothing to eat; I will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>His disciples answered, Whence can we get bread enough, in the solitude, to satisfy such a crowd?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.34'>He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.35'>Then commanding the people to recline upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>he took the seven loaves and the fishes, which, having given thanks, he divided and gave to his disciples, who distributed them among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.37'>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off seven hand-baskets full of the fragments that remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.38'>Now they that had eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.39'>Then having dismissed the multitude, he embarked, and sailed to the coast of Magdala.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.16'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>Thither some Pharisees and Sadducees repaired, who, to try him, desired that he would show them a sign in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.2'>He answering, said to them, In the evening you say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.3'>and in the morning, There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You can judge aright of the appearance of the sky, but can you not discern the signs of the times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>An evil and adulterous race demands a sign, but no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the Prophet Jonah. Then leaving them he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.5'>Now his disciples, before they came over, had forgot to bring loaves with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>Jesus said to them, Take head, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>On which they said, reasoning among themselves, This is because we have brought no loaves with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>Jesus perceiving it, said, What do you reason amongst yourselves, O you distrustful! that I speak thus, because you have brought no loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Have you no reflection? or do you not remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the fragments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.10'>nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many hand-baskets you filled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.11'>How is it, that you do not understand, that I spoke not concerning bread, when I bade you beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.12'>Then they understood, that he cautioned them not against the leaven which the Pharisees and the Sadducees used in bread, but against their doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.13'>As Jesus was going to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.14'>They answered, Some say, John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.15'>But who, returned he, do you say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Simon Peter answering, said, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>Jesus replying, said to him, Happy are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.18'>I tell you, likewise, you are named Stone; and on this rock I will build my congregation, over which the gates of Hades shall not prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.19'>Moreover, I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.20'>Then he forbade his disciples to tell any many that he is the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.21'>From that time Jesus began to disclose to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer much from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that he must be raised the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.22'>On which, Peter taking him aside, reproved him, saying, Be this far from you, Master; this shall not befall you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.23'>But he turning, said to Peter, Get you thence, adversary, you are an obstacle in my way; for you relish not the things of God, but the things of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.24'>Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.25'>For, whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.26'>What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life? or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.27'>For the Son of Man, vested with his Father's glory, shall come hereafter with his heavenly messengers, and recompense every one according to his actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.28'>Indeed, I say to you, some of those who are present, shall not taste death, until they see the Son of Man enter upon his Reign.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.17'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.1'>After six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, brother of James, apart to the top of a high mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.2'>and was transfigured in their presence, His face shone as the sun; and his raiment became white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>And presently appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>Peter, upon this, addressing Jesus, said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us make here, if you will, three booths; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was speaking, behold! a bright cloud covered them, and out of the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight; hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.6'>The disciples, hearing this, fell upon their faces, and were greatly frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.7'>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, Arise; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.8'>Then lifting up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.9'>As they went down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell no person what you have seen, until the Son of Man rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.10'>Then the disciples asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must come first?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.11'>Jesus answering, said to them, To consummate the whole, Elijah, indeed, must come first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.12'>But I tell you, Elijah is come already, though they did not acknowledge him, but have treated him as they pleased. Thus they will treat the Son of Man also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.13'>Then the disciple understood, that he spoke concerning John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.14'>When they were come to the multitude, a man came to him, who kneeling, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.15'>Sir, have pity on my son; for he is grievously distressed with lunacy; often he falls into the fire, and often into the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.16'>and I presented him to your disciples; but they could not cure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.17'>Jesus answering, said, O unbelieving and perverse race! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.18'>Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out: and the lad was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.19'>At that time the disciple came to him privately, saying, Why could not we expel the demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.20'>Jesus answered, Because of your unbelief; for, indeed, I say to you, if you had faith, though but as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mountain, Remove to yonder place, and it would remove: yes, nothing would be impossible to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.21'>This kind, however, is not dispossessed, unless by prayer and fasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.22'>While they remained in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is to be delivered up to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.23'>who will kill him: but the third day he shall be raised again. And they were grieved exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.24'>When they were come to Capernaum, the collectors came and asked Peter, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.25'>He said, Yes. Being come into the house, before he spoke, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth exact tribute or custom? from their own sons, or from others?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.26'>Peter answered, From others. Jesus replied, The sons then are exempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.27'>Nevertheless, lest we shall give them offense, go to the sea and throw a line, draw out the first fish that is hooked, and, having opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for me and you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.5'>Nay, whosoever receives one such child, in my name, receives me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>but whosoever shall ensnare any of these little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were sunk in the ocean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>Alas for the world because of snares! Snares indeed there must be; nevertheless, alas for the ensnarer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>Wherefore, if your hand or foot ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter lame or maimed into life, than having two hands or feet to be cast into the everlasting fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>And if your eye ensnare you, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.10'>Beware of contemning any of these little ones; for I assure you, that in heaven, their angels continually behold the face of my heavenly Father:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>Wherefore, if your brother trespass against you, go and expostulate with him, when you and he are alone together. If he hear you, you have gained your brother;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>His fellow-servants seeing this, were deeply affected, and went, and informed their master of all that had passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his master, having given orders to call him, said to him, You wicked servant: all that debt I forgave you, because you besought me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>So his master, being provoked, delivered him to the jailors, to remain in their hands until he should clear the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>Thus will my heavenly Father treat every one of you, who forgives not, from his heart, his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>«and said,'For this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and adhere to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>Wherefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What, then, God has conjoined, let not man separate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They replied, Why, then, did Moses command to give a writing of divorce, and dismiss her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>He answered, Moses, indeed, because of your intractable disposition, permitted you to divorce your wives, but it was not so from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>Therefore, I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for whoredom, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries the woman divorced, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>His disciples said to him, If such be the condition of the husband, it is better to live unmarried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>He answered, They alone are capable of living thus, on whom the power is conferred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>For some are eunuchs from their birth; others have been made eunuchs by men; and others, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, have made themselves eunuchs. Let him act this part who can act it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then children were presented to him, that he might lay his hands on them, and pray, but the disciples reproved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>Jesus said, Let the children alone, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>And having laid his hands on them, he departed thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>Afterward, one approaching, said to him, Good Teacher, what good must I do to obtain eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>He answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good. If you would enter into that life, keep the commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>«He said to him, Which? Jesus answered, » 'You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>«Honor father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man replied, All these I have observed from my childhood. In what am I still deficient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus answered, If you would be perfect, go sell your estate, and give the price to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>The young man hearing this, went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, Indeed, I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>I say further, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>The disciples, who heard this with amazement, said, Who then can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus, looking at them, answered, With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter replying, said, As for us, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall be our reward?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that at the Renovation, when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting upon the twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>And whoever shall have forsaken, on my account, houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, shall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.30'>But many shall be first that are last, and last that are first.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>When Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside, and said to them,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>When they were nigh Jerusalem, being come to Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>saying, Go to the village opposite to you, where you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her; loose them, and bring them hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If any man say anything to you, say, Your Master wants them, and he will send them directly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>Now all this was done, that the words of the Prophet might be fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>«Say to the daughters of Zion, behold your King comes to you lowly, riding on an ass, even the colt of a laboring beast.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>Accordingly the disciples went, and having done as Jesus had commanded them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>brought the ass and the colt, and covering them with their mantles, made him ride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Now the greater part spread their mantles in the way; others lopped branches off the trees, and strowed them in the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>while the crowd that went before and that followed, shouted, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, everybody asking, Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The crowd answered, It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Then Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove thence all who sold and who brought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the stalls of those who sold doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>«and said to them, It is written,'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Then the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders which he performed, and the boys crying in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>«said to him with indignation, Do you hear what these say? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read,'From the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast procured praise?'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>And leaving them, he went out of the city of Bethany, where he remained that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>Returning to the city in the morning, he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it; but finding only leaves on it, said, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward. And the fig tree withered forthwith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>When the disciples saw it, they said with astonishment, how soon is the fig tree withered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, if you have an unshaken faith, you may not only do as much as is done to the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, Be lifted up, and thrown into the sea, it shall be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>Whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, with faith, you shall receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>Being come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came near, as he was teaching, and said, by what authority do you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answering, said to them, I also have a question to propose, which if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Whence had John authority to immerse? From heaven or from men? Then they reasoned thus within themselves: If we say, From heaven, he will retort, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>And if we say, From men, we dread the multitude, amongst whom John is universally accounted a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>They, therefore, answered him, We can not tell. Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>But what do you think of this? A man had two sons, and addressing his elder son, said, Son, go work today in any vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>He answered, I will not, but afterward repented and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>Then addressing the younger, he bade him likewise. He answered, Immediately, Sir, but went not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Now, which of the two obeyed his father? They said, The first. Jesus replied, Indeed, I say to you, even the publicans and harlots show you the way into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>For John came to you in the way of sanctity, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: yet you who saw this, did not afterward repent and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Hear another parable: A landlord planted a vineyard, and hedged it round, and digged a wine press in it, and built a tower; and having farmed it out, went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When the vintage approached, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>But they seized his servants, beat one, drove away with stones another, and killed another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Again he sent other servants more respectable; but they received the same treatment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>finally he sent his son to them: for he said, They will reverence my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and keep possession of his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>Then they seized him, thrust him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When, therefore, the proprietor of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They answered, He will put those wretched to a wretched death, and will let the vineyard to others, who will render him the fruits in the season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>«Jesus replied, Did you never read in the scriptures,'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner? This the Lord has effected, and we behold it with admiration.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>Know, therefore, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation who will produce the fruits of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>For whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be bruised; and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>The chief priests and the Pharisees hearing his parables, perceived that he spoke of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>but though they wished to lay hold on him, they were afraid of the populace, who reckoned him a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Jesus continuing to discourse to them in parables, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>The Administration of Heaven resembles the conduct of a king, who having made a marriage feast for his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.3'>sent his servants to call them, who had been invited; but they would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited I have prepared my feast; my bullocks and fatlings are slain, and all is ready; come to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they turned away with indifference, one to his farm, another to his merchandize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>And the rest seizing his servants, abused and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>When the king heard this, being enraged, he sent his soldiers, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, The entertainment is ready; but they who were invited were not worthy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>go therefore, into the public roads, and all that you can find, invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>Accordingly they went into the highways, and assembled all that they found, good and bad, so that the hall was furnished with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>When the king came in to see the guests, observing one who had not on a wedding garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>he said to him, Friend, how came you here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and thrust him out into darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>for there are many called, but few chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees retired, and having consulted how they might entrap him in his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>sent to him some of their disciples, and some Herodians, who being instructed by them, said, Rabbi, we know that you are sincere, and faithfully teach the way of God, without partiality, for you respect not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us, therefore, your opinion: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>Jesus, perceiving their malice, said, Dissemblers, why would you entangle me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me the tribute money. And they reached him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>He asked them, Whose image and inscription is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They answered, Cesar's. He replied, Render, then, to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and to God that which is God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>And admiring his answer, they left him, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day Sadducees, who say that there is no future life, came to him and addressed him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>Rabbi, Moses has said, if one die, and have no children, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise issue to the deceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there lived among us seven brothers; the eldest married and died without issue, leaving his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>Thus also the second, and the third, and so to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Now, at the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven; for they all married her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answering, said to them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>for in that state, they neither marry, nor give in marriage: they resemble the angels of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But as to the revival of the dead, have you not read what God declared to you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>«I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?» 'God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>Now, the people who heard this, were struck with awe at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>Meantime, the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, flocked about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>Then, one of them, a lawyer, trying him, proposed this question,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>«Jesus answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and greatest commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>«The second is like it,'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>saying, What do you think of the Messiah? Who son should he be? They answered, David's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He replied, How then does David, speaking by inspiration, call him his Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>«The Lord,» 'says he, '«said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your foes your footstool.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If the Messiah were David's son, would David call him his Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>To this none of them could answer; and from that day no person presumed to interrogate him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.23'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.1'>Then Jesus addressed the people and his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.2'>saying, The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' chair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.3'>therefore observe and do whatsoever they enjoin you; nevertheless, follow not their example; for they say and do not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.4'>Heavy and intolerable burdens they prepare for other men's shoulders, burdens to which they themselves will not put a finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.5'>But whatever they do they do to be observed by men. For this they wear broader phylacteries than others, and larger tufts on their mantles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.6'>and love the uppermost places at entertainments, and the principal seats in the synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.7'>and salutations in public places; and to hear men addressing them, cry, Rabbi, Rabbi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.8'>But as for you, assume not the title of Rabbi; for you have only one teacher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.9'>and style no man on earth your father, for he alone is your Father, who is in heaven; and all you are brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>They said, however, not during the festival, lest there be a commotion among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon, formerly a leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to him with an alabaster box of balsam, very precious, which she poured on his head while he was at table.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>said to them, My soul is overwhelmed with a deadly anguish; abide here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going a little before, he threw himself on his face, and praying, said, My Father, remove this cup from me, if it be possible; nevertheless, not as I would, but as thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he returned to his disciples, and finding them asleep, said to Peter, Is it so, then, that you could not keep awake with me a single hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that you be not overcome by temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>A second time he withdrew and prayed, saying, O my Father, if there be no exemption for me; if I must drink this cup, thy will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>Upon his return, he again found them sleeping, (for their eyes were overpowered.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>Again, leaving them, he went and prayed the third time, using the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came back to his disciples, and said to them, Do you sleep now, and take your rest? Behold, the hour approaches, when the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us be going; lo! he who betrays me is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>Before he was done speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared with a great multitude, armed with swords and clubs, and sent by their chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The man whom I shall kiss in he; secure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And coming directly to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus answered, Friend, for what purpose do you come? Then they advanced, and laying hands on Jesus, seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Upon this, one of Jesus' company laying hands upon his sword, drew it; and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Jesus said to him, Sheathe your sword; for whoever has recourse to the sword, shall fall by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think, that I can not presently invoke my Father, who would send to my relief more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But in that case how should the scriptures be accomplished, which declare that these things must be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>Then turning to, the multitude, he said, Do you come with swords and clubs to apprehend me, like people in pursuit of a robber? I sat daily amongst you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened, that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Now thy who had apprehended Jesus, brought him to Caiaphas the high priest, with whom the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him at a distance, to the court of the high priest's house, and having gone in, sat with the officers to see the issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Meantime the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought out false evidence against Jesus, upon which they might condemn him to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But though many false witnesses appeared, they found it not. At length two false witnesses came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>who charged him with saying, I can demolish the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>Then the high priest rising, said to him, Do you answer nothing to what these men testify against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>Jesus remaining silent, he added, On the part of the living God, I adjure you to tell us, whether you be the Messiah, the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus answered him, It is as you say: nay, be assured, that hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest, rending his clothes, said, He has uttered blasphemy. What further need have we of witnesses, now that you have heard him blaspheme?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What think you? They answered, He deserves to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face. Some gave him blows on the head, and others struck him on the cheeks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>and said, Divine to us, Messiah, who it was the smote you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting without in the court, and a maid servant came to him, and said, You also were with Jesus, the Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before them all, saying, I know nothing of the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And as he went out into the porch, another maid observing him, said to them, This man too was there with Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Again he denied, swearing that he knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>Soon after some of the bystanders said to Peter, You are certainly one of them, for your speech discovers you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Upon which, with execrations and oaths, he asserted that he did not know him; and immediately the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Then Peter remembered the word, which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will thrice disown me. And he went out an wept bitterly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people have consulted against Jesus, how they might procure his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>conducted him bound to Pontius Pilate, the procurator, to whom they delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who had betrayed him, finding that he was condemned, repented; and returning the thirty shekels to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>said, I have sinner, in that I have betrayed the innocent. They answered, What is that to us? See you to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>After which, having thrown down the money in the temple, he went away, and strangled himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests taking the money, said, It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>But, after deliberating, they bought with it the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>for which reason that field is, to this day, called, The Field of Blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>«Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,» 'The thirty shekels, the price at which he was valued, I took, as the Lord appointed me, from the sons of Israel,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>who gave them for the potter's field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus appeared before the procurator, who questioned him, saying, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>But when he was arraigned by the chief priests and the elders, he made no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear of how many crimes they accuse you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he answered not one word, which surprised the procurator exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now the procurator was accustomed to release, at the festival, any one of the prisoners whom the multitude demanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a famous prisoners named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore. when they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom shall I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Messiah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>(For he perceived that through envy they had delivered him up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>besides, while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent him this message, Have nothing to do with this innocent person; for today, I have suffered much in a dream, on his account.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders instigated the populace to demand Barabbas, and cause Jesus to be executed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>Therefore, when the procurator asked, which of the two he should release, they all answered, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate replied, What then shall I do with Jesus, whom they call Messiah? They all answered, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>The procurator said, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried the louder, saying, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Pilate perceiving that he was so far from prevailing, that they grew more tumultuous, took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this innocent person. See you to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answering, said, His blood be upon us, and upon your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them, and having caused Jesus to be scourged, delivered him up to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>After this, the procurator's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium, where they gathered around him all the band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And having stripped him, they robed him in a scarlet cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and crowned him with a wreath of thorns, and put a rod in his right hand, and kneeling before him in mockery. cried, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting upon him, they took the rod and struck him with it on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>When they had mocked him, they disrobed him again, and having put his own raiment on him, led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they went out of the city, they met one Simon, a Cyrenian, whom they constrained to carry the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>and being arrived at a place called Golgotha, which signifies a Place of Skulls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him to drink, vinegar mixed with wormwood, which, having tasted, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>After they had nailed him to the cross, they parted his garments by lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And having sat down there, they guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And over his head they placed this inscription, denoting the cause of his death: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Two robbers also were crucified with him, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>Meanwhile the passengers reviled him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, You who could demolish the temple, and rebuild it in three days; if you be God's Son, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>The chief priests also, with the scribes and elders, deriding him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others: can he not save himself? If he be King of Israel, let him now descend from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God. Let God deliver him now, if he regard him; for he called himself God's Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The robbers too, his fellow-sufferers, upbraided him in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour to the ninth, the whole land was in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About the ninth hour, Jesus cried aloud, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of the bystanders hearing this, said, He calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Instantly one of them ran, brought a sponge, and soaked it in vinegar, and having fastened it to a stick, presented it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, Forbear, we shall see whether Elijah will come to save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus having again cried with a loud voice, resigned his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And, behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom, the earth trembled, and the rocks split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>Graves also burst open; and after his resurrection, the bodies of several saints who slept were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>came out of the graves, went into the holy city, and were seen by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion, and they who, with him, guarded Jesus, observing the earthquake, and what passed, were exceedingly terrified, and said, This was certainly the son of a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Several women also were there, looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, assisting him with their service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among them were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>In the evening a rich Arimathean named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Pilate having given orders to deliver it to Joseph,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>he took the body, wrapped it in clean linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and deposited it in his own tomb, which he had newly caused to be hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the entrance, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary were there, sitting over against the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>On the morrow, being the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees repaired in a body to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>and said, My lord, we remember that this impostor, when alive, said, Within three days I shall be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be guarded till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him, and say to the people, He is raised from the dead; for this last imposture would prove worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate answered, You have a guard; make the sepulcher as secure as you can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>Accordingly they went and secured it, sealing the stone, and posting guards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Sabbath being over, and the first day of the week beginning to dawn, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary, went to visit the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>Now there had been a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord had descended from heaven, who, having rolled the stone from the entrance, sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His countenance was like lightning, and his apparel white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>Seeing him, the guards quaked with terror, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel said to the women, Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here; for he is risen, as he foretold. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, say to his disciples, He is risen from the dead; behold he goes before you to Galilee, where you shall see him. Take notice: I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>Instantly they went from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to inform his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>When they were gone, Jesus himself met them, saying, Rejoice. Upon which they prostrated themselves before him, and embraced his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren to repair to Galilee, and there they shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>They were no sooner gone, than some of the guard went into the city, and informed the chief priests of all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>These, after meeting and consulting with the elders, gave a large sum to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>with this injunction: Say, his disciples came by night, and stole him while we were asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this come to the procurator's ears, we will appease him, and indemnify you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money, and acted agreeably with to their instructions. Accordingly this report is current among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, whither Jesus had appointed them to repair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they threw themselves prostrate before him; yet some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came near, and said to them, All authority is given to me in heaven and upon the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>go, convert all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all the things which I have commanded you: and behold, I am with you always, even to the conclusion of this state.</verse>
