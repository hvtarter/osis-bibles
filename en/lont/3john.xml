      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder, to Gaius, the beloved, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray, that with respect to all things, you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came, and bore witness to your truth, even as you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than that which I have when I hear my children are walking in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully what you perform for the brethren, and for the strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>These have borne testimony to your love, in the presence of the congregation; whom, if you help forward on their journey, in a manner worthy of God, you will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>Because for his name's sake, they went forth, receiving nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We, therefore, ought to entertain such, that we may be joint laborers in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the congregation: but Diotrephes, who affects a pre-eminence among them, does not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>For this cause, when I come, I will bring his deeds to remembrance, which he practices-prating against us with malicious words; and, not content with this, he does not himself receive the brethren, and forbids them who would, and casts them out of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good, is of God; but he who does evil, has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Testimony is borne to Demetrius, by all, and by the truth itself; and we also bear testimony; and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I have many things to write; but I do not incline to write them to you with pen and ink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>for I hope immediately to see you, and so we shall speak face to face. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
