      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, (according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledgment of the truth, which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can not lie, promised before the times of the ages-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>who has now manifested his word, at the proper season, by the proclamation with which I am entrusted, according to the appointment of God our Saviour;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, my genuine son, according to the common faith: Favor, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this purpose, I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things left unfinished, and to ordain seniors in every city, as I commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If any one be without blame, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of riotous living, nor unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop should be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not a striker, not one who makes gain by base methods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable; a lover of good men, prudent, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast the true doctrine, as he has been taught; that he may be able, by wholesome teaching, both to exhort and to confute the gain-sayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly and foolish talked and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths must be stopped; who subvert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>«One of themselves, a prophet of their own, has said,» 'The Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy bodies.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be healthy in the faith-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish fables, and precepts of men who pervert the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure, all meats are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving, nothing is pure; for both their understanding and conscience are polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God; but by works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But do you inculcate the things which become wholesome doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that aged men be vigilant, grave, prudent, healthy by faith, love, patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>That aged women, in like manner, be in deportment as becomes sacred persons-not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, good teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may persuade the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be calm, chaste, careful of their families, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be defamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>The young men, in like manner, exhort to govern their passions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things make yourself a pattern of good works: in teaching, show incorruptness, gravity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>wholesome speech which can not be condemned; that he who is on the opposite side may be ashamed, having nothing bad to say concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, and in all things be careful to please, not answering again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not secretly stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the favor of God, which brings salvation, has appeared to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>expecting the blessed hope; namely, the appearing of the glory of the great God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things inculcate, and exhort, and reprove with all authority; let no one despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be subject to governments, and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no one; to be no fighters, but equitable, showing all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For even we ourselves were formerly foolish, disobedient, erring, slavishly serving diverse inordinate desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the goodness and philanthropy of God our Saviour shone forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>he saved us-not on account of works of righteousness which we had done-but according to his own mercy, through the bath of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that being justified by his favor, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This doctrine is true: and concerning these, I charge you to affirm strongly, that those who have believed in God, be studious to stand foremost in good works. These are things that are honorable and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law, resist; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A factionist, after a first and second admonition, reject;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a person is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, make haste to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Diligently help forward on their journey, Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos, that nothing may be wanting to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let ours also learn to stand foremost in good works, for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me salute you. Salute them who love us in the faith. Favor be with you all.</verse>
