      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who in ancient times, spoke often, and in various ways, to the fathers, by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has, in these last days, spoken to us by a Son, whom he has constituted Lord of all things, by whom, also, he made the universe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who, being in effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character, and controlling all things by his own powerful word, after he had, by himself, made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>being exalted as far above the angels, as the name he has inherited, is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>«For, to which of the angels did he at any time say,'Thou art my Son: today I have begotten thee'? and again,'I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son'?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>«But when he brings again the First-born into the world, he says,» 'Let all the angels of God worship him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>«Whereas, concerning angels, he says,» 'Who makes winds his angels, and flaming fire his ministers.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>«But to the Son,» 'Thy throne, O God, endures for ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of rectitude.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>«Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy associates.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>«And,» 'Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but thou dost remain; and they, as a garment, shall grow old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>«and, as a vesture, thou wilt fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same; and they shall be changed; but thou art the same; and thy years shall never fail.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>«Moreover, to which of the angels did he say, at any time,» 'Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>«Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall inherit salvation?»</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>(On this account, we ought to attend the more earnestly to the things which were heard; lest at any time we should left them slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which, beginning to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them who heard him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God, also, bearing witness, both by signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his own pleasure.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>Moreover, he has not subjected to the angels the world to come, of which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>«But one in a certain place has testified, saying,» 'What is man that thou art mindful of him-or the son of man, that thou dost regard him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>«thou hast put all things under his feet.» 'Now, by putting all things in subjection to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him; but now, we do not yet see all things subjected to him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he, by the favor of God, might taste death for all; for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make him, who leads many sons to glory-even the Captain of their Salvation-perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he who sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all of one Father; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>«saying,» 'I will announce thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the congregation I will sing praises to thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>«And, again,» 'I will put my trust in him.' 'And again, '«Behold I, and the children whom God has given me.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since, then, the children partook of flesh and blood; he, also, in like manner, partook of these; that, through death, he might vanquish him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and deliver them, who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For, indeed, he has not at all assumed the nature of angels; but he has assumed the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Hence, it was necessary for him to be made like his brethren in all things; that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest, in matters pertaining to God, in order to expiate the sins of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>for, by what he suffered himself, when tried; he is able to succor them who are tried.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, attentively consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whom we have confessed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who, as well as Moses, is faithful to him that appointed him over all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>Indeed, he has been accounted worthy of glory, as far superior to Moses, as that of the builder is superior to the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>Now every house is built by some one; but he, the builder of all things, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses, indeed, as a servant, was faithful in all his house, for a testimony of the things that were to be spoken by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ, as a Son, over his own house-whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence, and the rejoicing of our hope, unshaken to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>«Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says,» 'Today, if you will hear his voice,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers tempted me, and proved me, yet saw my works for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Wherefore, I was displeased with that generation, and said, They always err in heart, and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>«So, I swore, in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Brethren, take heed, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, by departing from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But, lest any of you be hardened, through the deceitfulness of sin, exhort one another every day, while it is called Today:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>(for we are all partakers of Christ, if, indeed, we hold fast this first confidence firm to the end;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>«with this saying,» 'Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some, when they heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>Was it not with them who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest, but to them who did not believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So, we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Wherefore, let us be afraid, lest a promise of entrance into the rest, being left, any of you should seem to fall short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For glad tidings have been proclaimed to us, as well as to them: but the word which they heard did not profit them; not being mixed with faith in them who heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>«For we, who have believed, do enter into the rest, as he said,'So, I swore, in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest'; namely, from the works that were finished at the formation of the world.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>«For he has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day, thus:» 'And God rested on the seventh day, from all his works.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>«And in this, again,» 'They shall not enter into my rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and that they who first received the good tidings, did not enter in on account of unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>«again, he limits a certain day, saying, by David,» 'Today,' 'after so long a time; as it is said, '«Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For, if Joshua has caused them to rest, he would not, after that, have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains, therefore, a divine rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into his rest, has himself, also, rested from his own works, like as God, also, rested from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Wherefore let us carefully strive to enter into THIS REST, lest any one should fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is no creature concealed from his sight, for all things are naked and open to the eyes of him, to whom we must give an account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Now, having a great High Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a High Priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses; but one who was tried in all points, according to the likeness of his nature to our ours, without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us, therefore, approach, with boldness, to the throne of favor, that we may receive mercy, and obtain favor for the purpose of seasonable help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men, is appointed to perform for men the things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to have a right measure of compassion on the ignorant and erring: because he himself, also, is surrounded with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And for that reason he must, as for the people, so, also, for himself, offer sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Now, as no one takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>«so, also, Christ did not assume to himself the honor of being a High Priest: but he who said to him,'Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee'-»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>«also says, in another place,» 'Thou art a Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>He, (who, in the days of his flesh, having, with loud cries, and with tears, offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and was delivered from his fear,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though being a Son, learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being made perfect, became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being proclaimed by God a High Priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>(concerning whom we have much to say, and of difficult interpretation, since you have become dull of apprehension.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For, when, by this time, you ought to be teachers, you have need of some one to teach you again the first elements of the oracles of God; and have become such as need milk, rather than solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>Now every one who uses milk, is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>but solid food is for those of a mature age, whose faculties have been habituated by long practice to discriminate both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore, leaving the first principles of Christian doctrine, let us progress toward maturity, not laying again the foundation concerning reformation from dead works, and faith toward God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>concerning the doctrine of immersions, and of imposition of hands, of a resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>for this we will do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible to renew again to reformation those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age which was to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and yet have fallen away, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and exposing him to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the land that drinks in the rain, which often comes upon it, and brings forth herbs, fit for them by whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but that which produces thorns and briers, is reprobated, and nigh to a curse; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we hope better things of you, even things which are connected with salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work, and the love which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>Yet, we earnestly desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to the realizing of this hope, to the end-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you may not be slothful, but imitators of them who, through faith and patience, are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>«saying,'Surely, blessing, I will bless you, and multiplying, I will multiply you';»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>and so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men, indeed, swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is, to them, an end of all contradiction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Therefore, God, willing more abundantly to show to their heirs of promise the immutability of his purpose, confirmed it with an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that, by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled away to lay hold on the hope set before us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into the place within the vail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where a forerunner has entered on our account; even Jesus, made a High Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedec-king of Salem, Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom Abraham imparted even a tenth of all; being, indeed, by interpretation, first, king of righteousness, and next, also, king of Salem; which, by interpretation, is king of peace-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>was without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginnings of days, nor end of life: but, being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now, consider how great this priest was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>For they, indeed, of the sons of Levi, who received the priesthood, have a commandment to tithe people according to the law; that is, their brethren, although they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but he, who did not derive his pedigree from their progenitors, tithed Abraham, and blessed the holder of the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now, beyond all contradiction, the less is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Besides, here, indeed, men, who die, take tithes; but there one, of whom it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And, as one may say, even Levi, who receives tithes, was tithed in Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Moreover, if, indeed, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should arise, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>Wherefore, the priesthood being changed, there is, of necessity, a change also of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he to whom these things are said, was of a different tribe, of which no one gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is very plain that our Lord had sprung from Judah, in relation to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>Moreover, it is still more plain that, according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>another priest arises, who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>«For he testifies,» 'Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>Here then, there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made no one perfect) -and the superinduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>Moreover, inasmuch as not without an oath-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>«(for they, indeed, were make priests without an oath, but he, with an oath, by him who said to him,'The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec,')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much was Jesus made the surety of a better institution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Besides, many, indeed, are made priests, because by death they are hindered from continuing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because he lives for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Hence, also, he is for able to save them who come to God through him; always living to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>Now such a High Priest became us; who, being holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>has not, like the high priests, need, from time to time, to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people; for this latter he did once, when he offered himself up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law constitutes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, constituted the Son, who is perfected for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister of the holy places; namely, of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is constituted to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Hence, it was necessary that this High Priest, also, should have something he might offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For, indeed, if he were on earth, he could not be a priest, there being priests who offer gifts according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>«(These perform divine service for an example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses, when about to construct the tabernacle, was admonished of God:'See, now (says he,) that you make all things according to the type that was showed you in the Mount.')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>Besides, he has now obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better institution, which has been established upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first institution had been faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>«But, finding fault, he says to them,» 'Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new institution with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the institution which I made with their fathers, at the time of my taking them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt-because they did not abide in my institution, I also neglected them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>Now this is the institution which I will make with the house of Israel, after these days, says the Lord. I will put my laws into their mind, and inscribe them on their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now, indeed, the first institution had both ordinances of service, and a worldly holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For the first tabernacle, which is called holy, was set in order; in which were both the candlestick and the table, and the showbread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and behind the second vail, the tabernacle which is called most holy-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having the golden censer, and the ark of the institution, covered everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron, which budded, and the tables of the institution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above it, the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which things we can not at present speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now, these things being this set in order, the priests go at all times indeed into the first tabernacle, performing the services;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second tabernacle-the high priest alone-once every year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way of the holy places was not yet laid open, while the first tabernacle was yet standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which was a figurative representation for the time being, during which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which can not, with respect to the conscience, make him who does the service perfect-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>only with meats and drinks, and divers immersions- ordinances concerning the flesh, imposed till the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being come-a High Priest of the good things to come-has, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is to say, not of this building,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>entered once into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption; not indeed, by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the polluted, sanctified to the cleansing of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through an Eternal Spirit, offered himself without fault, to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And, for this reason, he is mediator of the new institution, that, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first institution, those who had been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>Now, where there is such an institution, the death of the instituted sacrifice must necessarily intervene:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>for since the institution is ratified over the dead, it has no force while the instituted sacrifice lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Hence, neither was the first introduced without blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>«for» 'when Moses had spoken every precept in the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves, and of goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself, and the people:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>«saying,» 'This is the blood of the institution, which God has enjoined on you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Moreover, he in like manner sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all thing, according to the law, were cleansed with blood; and without the shedding of blood, there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was necessary, then, indeed, that the representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>Therefore, Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, the antitypes of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God, on our account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Not, however, that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with other blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>for then he must have often sufferance since the foundation of the world: but now, once, at the conclusion of the ages, he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And, forasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, and after that, the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>even so Christ, being once offered, to bear away the sins of many, will, to them who look for him, appear a second time, without a sin-offering, in order to salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>Moreover, the law, containing only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of these things, never can, with the same sacrifices which they offer every year continually, make those who come to them, perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then would they not have ceased to be offered: since the offerers being once purified, should not have had any more conscience of sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>but, in these, there is a remembrance of sins yearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>Besides, it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>«Wherefore, when coming into the world, he says,» 'Sacrifice and offering thou hast not willed; but a body hast thou prepared me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In whole burnt offerings, and sin offerings, thou hast no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>«Then, said I, behold, I come to do thy will, O God! (In the volume of the book it is written concerning me.)»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Having said above, the sacrifice, and offering; and whole burnt offerings, and sin offerings thou hast not willed, neither has pleasure in them, (which are offered according to the law,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>«and then he said,» 'Behold, I come to do thy will.' 'He takes away the first will, that he may establish the second.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which WILL we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And, indeed, every priest stands, daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which never can take away sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>but he, having offered only one sacrifice for sins, through his whole life, sat down at the right hand of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>thenceforth waiting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>Wherefore, by one offering, he has perfected for ever the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>Moreover, also, the Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for, after he has said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>«This is the institution which I will make with them after these days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their hearts, and inscribe them on their minds; he adds,»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>«and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having, therefore, brethren, free access to the most holy place, by the blood of Jesus-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us through the vail, (that is, his flesh,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and-a great High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith-having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>let us hold fast the confession of the hope unmoved; for he is faithful, who has promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us attentively consider one another, to excite to love and good works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully, after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a dreadful expectation of judgment, and of a fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Any one who disregarded the law of Moses, died without mercy, by two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much sorer punishment, think you, shall he be counted worthy, who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and reckoned the blood of the institution by which he was sanctified, a common thing, and has insulted the Spirit of Favor?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you also suffered with me in my bonds, and with joy sustained the spoiling of your goods, knowing within yourselves, that you have in heaven a better and a permanent substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Wherefore, cast not away your confidence, which has a great retribution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you must persevere in doing the will of God, that you may obtain the promised reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a very little while, and He who is coming, will come, and will not tarry.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now, faith is the confidence of things hoped for, and the conviction of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>By this, the ancients obtained reputation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith, we understand that the worlds were formed by the word of God; so that the things which were seen, were not made of things which do appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, on account of which he was commended as righteous; God testifying in favor of his oblations: and so, by it, though dead he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated, that he might not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for, before his translation, it was testified that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he who comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith, Noah, when he received a revelation concerning things not yet seen, being seized with religious fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his family; by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith, Abraham, when called to go out into a place which he should afterward receive as an inheritance, obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith, he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We have an altar of which they have no right to eat, who serve in the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>Moreover, the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought by the high priest into the most holy place, a sin-offering, are burnt without the camp:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>wherefore Jesus, also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Well, then, let us go forth to him out of the camp, nearing his reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For we have not here an abiding city, but we earnestly seek one to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>Through him, therefore, let us offer up continually, the sacrifice of praise to God; namely, the fruit of our lips, confessing to his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>But to do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your rulers, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your souls, as those who must give account: -that they may do this with joy, and not with mourning; for that would be unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, willing in all things to behave well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>And, I the more earnestly beseech you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting institution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>make you fit for every good work, to do his will, producing in you what is acceptable in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom we the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>Now I beseech you, brethren, suffer this word of exhortation, for indeed I have sent it to you in brief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know that our brother Timothy is sent away, with whom, if he come soon, I will see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Salute all your rulers, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Favor be with you all. Amen.</verse>
