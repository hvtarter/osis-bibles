        <title>(Writer: Ezra, means Help) (460 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>It was the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia. In order that the word of Jehovah given by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true, Jehovah moved the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia. He made a public statement through all his kingdom, and put it in writing, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>»These are the words of Cyrus, king of Persia: Jehovah the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>»May your God be with you and let you go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah. There you are to build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>»If any of his people in exile need help to return, their neighbors should give them help. They are to provide them with silver and gold, supplies and pack animals, as well as offerings to present in the Temple of God in Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>The heads of the clans of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the priests and Levites, and everyone else whose heart God had moved got ready to go and rebuild Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>Their neighbors helped by giving many things: silver utensils, gold, supplies, pack animals, other valuables, and offerings for the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>King Cyrus gave back the bowls and cups that King Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple in Jerusalem and put in the temple of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>And King Cyrus turned them over to Mithredath, chief of the royal treasury, who made an inventory of them for Sheshbazzar, the governor of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>Now this was their inventory: 30 gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes and 29 duplicates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>There were also 30 gold bowls, 410 matching silver bowls and 1,000 other articles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>All the articles of gold and silver numbered 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought all of them along with the exiles who traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>When the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people came together like one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, with his brothers, got up and built the altar of the God of Israel for burned offerings. This was according to the Law of Moses, the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>The returning exiles were afraid of the people who were living in the land. Regardless of that, they rebuilt the altar where it had stood before. Then they began once again to burn on it the regular morning and evening sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>They celebrated the Festival of Booths according to what is written. Each day they offered the sacrifices required for that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>They also offered the regular sacrifices to be burned whole and those to be offered at the New Moon Festival and at all the other Festivals of Jehovah, as well as all the offerings that were given to Jehovah voluntarily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>The people had not yet started to rebuild the Temple. Yet they began on the first day of the seventh month to burn sacrifices to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers. Meat and drink and oil were given to the people of Zidon and of Tyre, for the transport of cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, as Cyrus, king of Persia, had given them authority to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>The second year and third month of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, took charge of the construction. Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to Jerusalem: and the Levites, of twenty years or older, were responsible for overseeing the work of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, the sons of Hodaviah, together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brothers, the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>When the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of Jehovah, the priests, dressed in their robes, took their places with horns, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with brass instruments, to give praise to Jehovah in the way ordered by David, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>They praised Jehovah and thanked him, saying: »He is good; his loving kindness to Israel is for all generations.« All the people gave a joyful cry. They praised Jehovah because the foundation of Jehovahs house was in place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>Some of the priests, Levites, heads of families and old men who had seen the first house were present. When the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes they were overcome with weeping; and a number were crying out with joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping. The cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>News came to the enemies of Judah and Benjamin that the people who had come back were building a Temple to Jehovah, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>They approached Zerubbabel and the heads of families and said: »Let us help you build for we are servants of your God, the same as you. We have been making offerings to him from the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who sent us here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them: »You have no part with us in the building of a house for our God. We will do the work for Jehovah, the God of Israel, as Cyrus, king of Persia, has given us orders.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>The people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and tried to make them afraid to go on building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>They hired men to work against them and kept them from accomplishing their plans during the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, till Darius became king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>When Ahasuerus first became king, they put on record a statement against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>In the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his friends, sent a letter to Artaxerxes, king of Persia, writing it in the Aramaic language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, sent a letter against Jerusalem, to Artaxerxes the king as follows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>The letter was sent by Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe and their friends; the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites people of Susa, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>The rest of the nations the great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of the country over the river:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>»This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants living across the river send these words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>»We give news to the king that the Jews who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They are again building that uncontrolled and evil town. The walls are complete and they are repairing the bases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>»The king may be certain that when the town and its wall are completely rebuilt they will pay no tax or payment in goods or forced payments, and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>»Because we are responsible to the king, and it is not right for us to see the king's honor damaged, we have sent to give the king word of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>»That way a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled. It has been a cause of trouble to kings and countries. There were outbursts against authority in the past. That is the reason the town was laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>»We give you word, that if this town and its walls is completely rebuilt, your power in the country across the river will end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The king sent an answer to Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, and their friends living in Samaria, and to the rest of those across the river, saying, »Peace to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>»The meaning of the letter you sent to us has been made clear to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>»I gave orders for a search to be made, and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings, and that outbursts against authority have taken place there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>»Further, there have been great kings in Jerusalem. They ruled over all the country across the river. Taxes and tribute was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>»Give an order now that these men are to do no more work and that the building of the town is to be stopped till I give an order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>»Be sure to do this with all care. Do not let trouble increase to damage the king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then, after reading the king's letter, Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to Jerusalem, to the Jews to compel them by force to stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>So the work of the house of God at Jerusalem was stopped, till the second year of the rule of Darius, king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>The prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, went to work building the house of God at Jerusalem. The prophets of God were with them, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them and said, »Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then they said these words to them: »What are the names of the men who are at work on this building?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>The eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews, and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer came by letter about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>This is a copy of the letter Tattenai, the ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and his friends the Apharsachites, from across the river, sent to Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent him a letter saying: »To Darius the king, all peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>»This is to give the king word that we went to the land of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is made of large stones and has its walls supported with wood. The work is going on with diligence and they are making rapid progress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>»Then we asked the men responsible: Who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>»We requested their names, so that we might send you word, and give you the names of the men in charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>»Their answer was: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel.</verse>
