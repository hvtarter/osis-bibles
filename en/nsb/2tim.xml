        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>I am mindful of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God that is in you because of the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>God has not given us a spirit of timidity fear, but of power and love and discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me his prisoner. Join me in suffering for the good news according to the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>God has saved us and called us with a holy calling. This is not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace that was granted us in Christ Jesus, from all eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>The appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus revealed this. Jesus abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>I was appointed to be a messenger of this good news, an apostle, and a teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>It is for this reason that I suffer these things. But I am still full of confidence, because I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to keep safe until that day what he has entrusted to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you, as the example for you to follow. Remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>Through the power of the Holy Spirit, who lives in us. Keep guardobeypreserve the good things that have been entrusted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>You know that all that are in Asia turned away from me. This includes Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord grants mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>When he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>May the Lord grant him to find the mercy of God in that day, and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>You must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No soldier entangles himself in the affairs of this life. That way, he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>If anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The hard-working farmer should be first to receive his share of the crops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. He is a descendant of David, according to my good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal. But the word of God is not imprisoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>This is a faithful saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we endure, we will also reign with Him. If we deny him, He will deny us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to argue about words. This is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Be diligent to be presented approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But avoid worldly and empty discussion, for it will lead to further ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>This kind of talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>These men have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>The foundation of God stands firm having this seal: »Jehovah knows those who belong to him,« and: »Everyone who names the name of Jehovah is to abstain from wickedness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord with a clean heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing they produce quarrels controversyfighting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>The Lords servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind gentle to all, able to teach, and patient when wronged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>He should instruct those who oppose using meekness. Perhaps God will give them repentance that they may know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>They should come to their senses out of the snare of the Devil. He has taken them captive and they do his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>Know this also that in the last days perilous dangerous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous lovers of money, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, despisers of those who are good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Stay away from people like this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>Among them are those who creep into houses and lead captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away with various lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>They are constantly learning, and never able to grasp the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, rejected concerning the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>they will make no progress; for their foolishness will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>You carefully follow my teaching in conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, and patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>and also persecutions and sufferings. The things that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. Out of them the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yes, and all who would live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors will become worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>Continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>From childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to make you wise to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>God inspired all Scripture! It is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness. Greek: theopneustos: God-breathed</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>Thus the man of God may be completely equipped for every good work.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I solemnly charge you in the sight presence of God, and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine. Having their ears tickled, they will accumulate teachers who follow after their own lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>They will turn their ears away from the truth, and turn aside to myths fiction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>Be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist preacher of the good news, and fulfill your ministry.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>The crown of righteousness is laid up for me. The Lord, the righteous judge, will give it to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing manifestation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Do your best to come to me shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>When you come, bring the books, parchments, and the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At first no one defended me. They all abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the people of the nations might hear.
