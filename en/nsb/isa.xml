        <title>(Writer: Isaiah, means Jehovah is Salvation) (Completed after 723 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>This is the vision seen by Isaiah the son of Amoz. It is about Judah and Jerusalem at the time of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Listen, heaven, and pay attention, earth! Jehovah has spoken: »I raised my children and helped them grow, but they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>»The bull knows its owner, and donkey knows where its master feeds it. But Israel does not know. My people do not understand!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Woe to the sinful nation, people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who are corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah! They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have turned away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why do you still want to be beaten? Why do you continue to rebel? Your whole head is infected. Your whole heart is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head there is no healthy spot left on your body. You have only bruises, sores, and fresh wounds. They have not been cleansed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners destroy your fields in your presence. Your fields are devastated and taken over by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>My people, the daughter of Zion is left like an empty hut in a vineyard. It is like a shack in a cucumber field, like a city under attack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>If Jehovah of Hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Listen to the word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom! Pay attention to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>Jehovah says: »What do your many animal sacrifices mean to me? I have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams and enough fat from your fattened calves. I am not pleased with the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>»Who requires you to trample on my courtyards when you appear in my presence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>»Do not bring any more worthless grain offerings. Your incense is disgusting to me! So are your New Moon Festivals, your days of worship, and the assemblies you call. I cannot endure your evil assemblies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>»I hate your New Moon Festivals and your appointed festivals. They are a burden to me. I am tired of putting up with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>»When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you. Even though you offer many prayers, I will not listen because your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>»Wash yourselves! Become clean! Get your evil deeds out of my sight. Stop doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>»Learn to do good wellright. Seek justice. Correct oppressors. Defend orphans. Plead the case of widows.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>»Come now, let us reason together make things rightcorrect matters between us!« Says Jehovah. »Though your sins are like scarlet, they will become as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, they will become as white as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>»If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>»Refuse and rebel and swords will devour you. Jehovah has spoken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How the faithful town has become a prostitute! She was full of justice, and righteousness lived in her. But now murderers live there!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver is not pure. Your beer is watered down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your rulers are rebels, friends with thieves. They all love bribes and run after gifts. They never defend orphans. They do not listen to the widows' pleas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>That is why Jehovah, Jehovah of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says: »How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents! I will avenge myself against my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>»I will turn my power against you turn the back of my hand upon you. I will remove your impurities with bleach. I will get rid of all your worthless qualities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>»I will give you judges like you had long ago, advisers like you had in the beginning. After that you will be called the Righteous City, the Faithful City.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Jehovahs justice will pardon Zion. Those who return will be pardoned by Jehovahs righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>Rebels and sinners will be crushed at the same time. Those who abandon Jehovah will come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>You will be ashamed of the oaks that you wanted to worship. You will be embarrassed by the garden that you have chosen for your gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>You will be like an oak whose leaves wither and like a garden without water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>Strong people will become tinder for a fire. Their work will be the spark. Both of them will burn together. There will be no one to put out the fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The vision and prophetic message Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>In the last days the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established as the highest of the mountains and exalted above the hills. All the nations will stream to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>Then many people will come and say: »Let us go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the House of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them.« The law will go out from Zion. The word of Jehovah will go out from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>Then he will judge disputes between nations and settle matters between many people. They will beat hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not fight against each other, and they will not learn war anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>Come, descendants of Jacob, let us live in the light of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Jehovah, you have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob, because they are filled with Eastern influences. They practice witchcraft like the Philistines, and they make deals with foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is full of silver and gold. There is no limit to their treasures. Their land is also full of horses. There is no limit to their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land is full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>Man has been humbled. Everyman has been humiliated. Do not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Go in among the rocks and hide underground because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the magnificence of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The arrogant people will be humbled. High and mighty people will be brought down. On that day Jehovah alone will be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>All who are proud will be humbled. Jehovah of Hosts will have his day against all who are arrogant and conceited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>It will also be against all the towering and mighty cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>against all the high mountains and all the lofty hills,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>against every high tower and every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and also against all the large ships of Tarshish and all the beautiful boats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>Then arrogant people will be brought down. High and mighty people will be humiliated. On that day Jehovah alone will be honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>Then idols false gods will disappear completely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>People will go into caves in the rocks and into holes in the ground because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>That day people will throw their silver and gold idols, that they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and the bats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>They will go into caves in the rocks and into cracks in the cliffs because of Jehovahs terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Stop trusting people, whose breath life is in their nostrils. How can they be worth anything?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>Jehovah of Hosts, the Almighty RulerSovereign is going to take all support and supply of food and water from Jerusalem and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>He will take their heroes and soldiers, judges and prophets, fortunetellers and statesmen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>military leaders and civilian leaders, counselors, skilled workers, and experts in magic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>I will make boys their leaders. Childish tyrants will govern them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>People will oppress each other. Everyone will harass his neighbor. The young will tyrannize the old. The common people will taunt their superiors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>A person will grab one of his relatives from his father's family and say: »You have a coat. You will be our leader. This pile of ruins will be under your control.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>Then the relative will cry out: »I am not a healer! I do not have any food or a coat in my home. Do not make me a leader of the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because what they say and what they do is against Jehovah! They are defiant in his honored presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The expression on their faces will be held against them. They boast about their sins! They are like those of the people of Sodom. They do not even bother to hide them. How horrible it will be for these people. They have brought disaster on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Tell the righteous that blessings will come to them. They will taste the fruit of their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>How horrible it will be for the wicked! Disaster will strike them. What they have done to others will be done to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>Children oppress my people! Women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray. They confuse the direction of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>Jehovah stands erect to assert his power. He stands to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>Jehovah enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: »It is you who have devoured the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>»What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the face of the poor?« Declares Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Jehovah also said: »Because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, and go along with mincing steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>»Jehovah will cause sores to appear on the heads of the women of Zion. Jehovah will make their foreheads bare.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>On that day Jehovah will take away their fine things: jingling anklets, headbands, crescent-shaped necklaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>pendants, bracelets, scarves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>hats, ankle bracelets, blouses, perfume boxes, charms,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>signet rings, nose rings,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>mirrors, underwear, headdresses, and veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>Instead of the smell of perfume, there will be the smell of decay. They will wear ropes instead of belts. They will have baldheads instead of beautiful hair. They will wear sackcloth instead of expensive clothes. Their beauty will be scarred with brand marks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men will be killed by the sword, in war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>Her Zions gates will lament and mourn and she will sit on the ground deserted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>Seven women will grab one man and say: »We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes. Just let us marry you and be called by your name. Take away our disgrace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the Branch of Jehovah will be beautiful and glorious. And the fruit of the earth will be the delight pridejoy and the adornment of the survivors of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy along with everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>Jehovah will wash away the filth of the daughters women of Zion and purge the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>Then Jehovah will create over the entire area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night. A canopy shelter will be over all as the glory honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>There will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing to my loved one a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>He dug the soil all around and removed its stones. He planted it with the choicest vine. And he built a tower in the middle of it and also hewed out a wine vat in it. Then he expected it to produce good grapes, but it only produced worthless ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>»Now then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah, judge between my vineyard and me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>»What more could have been done for my vineyard than what I have already done for it? When I waited for it to produce good grapes, why did it produce only sour, wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>»Here is what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge and break down the wall that protects it. I will let wild animals eat it and trample it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>»It will turn into a desert, neither pruned nor cultivated. It will be covered with thorns and briars. I will command the clouds not to send rain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>I am Jehovah of Hosts All Powerful! Israel is the vineyard, and Judah is the garden I tended with care. I had hoped for honesty and for justice, but dishonesty and cries for mercy were all I found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Cursed are those who are joining house to house, and putting field to field, till there is no more living-space for any but themselves in all the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>With my own ears I heard Jehovah of Hosts say: »Many houses will become empty. Large, beautiful houses will be without people to live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>»A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine, and two quarts of seed will produce only four quarts of grain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>How horrible it will be for those who get up early in the morning to look for a drink and who sit up late at night until they are drunk from wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>At their feasts there are lyres and harps, tambourines and flutes, and wine. Yet, they do not pay attention to what Jehovah is doing or respect what his hands have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>My people will go into exile because they do not understand what I am doing. Honored men will starve, and common people will be parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>That is why the grave's appetite increases. It opens its mouth very wide so that honored people and common people will go down into it. Those who are noisy and joyous will go down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>People will be brought down. Everyone will be humiliated and the eyes of arrogant people will be abased humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>Jehovah of Hosts shows his greatness by doing what is right. He reveals his holiness by judging his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>In the ruins of the cities lambs will eat grass and young goats will find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who scatter sin with cords of falsehood and iniquity with a cart rope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>You say: »Let Jehovah hurry up and do what he says he will, so that we can see it. Let Israel's holy God carry out his plans. Let us see what he has in mind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>You are doomed! You call evil good and you call good evil. You turn darkness into light and light into darkness. You make what is bitter, sweet, and what is sweet you make bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>You are doomed! You think you are wise. You think you are so very clever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>You are doomed! Heroes of the wine bottle! Brave and fearless when it comes to mixing drinks!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>You let the guilty go free for a bribe and you keep the innocent from getting justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>You will go up in flames like straw and hay! You have rejected the law of the holy God Jehovah the All-Powerful Holy One of Israel. Now your roots will rot, and your blossoms will turn to dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>You are Jehovahs people, but you made him terribly angry, and he struck you with his mighty arm. Mountains shook, and dead bodies covered the streets like garbage. Jehovah is still angry. He is ready to strike you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>Jehovah raises up a flag for the nations far away. With a whistle he signals those at the ends of the earth. Look, they are coming very quickly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None of them grow tired or stumble. None of them slumber or sleep. The belts on their waists are not loose or their sandal straps broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Their arrows are sharpened. All their bows are strung and ready to shoot. Their horses' hoofs are as hard as flint. Their chariot wheels are as quick as the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>They roar like a lioness. They growl like a young lion. They growl as they snatch their prey and carry it off to where no one can rescue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>In that day they will roar over their prey as the sea roars. If they look at the land, they will see only darkness and distress. Thick clouds will darken even the light.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw discerned Jehovah seated on a throne, high and exalted. The train of his robe filled the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>They called to one another: »Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of Hosts. All the earth is full of his glory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>At the sound of their voices the foundations and thresholds trembled and the Temple was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>»Woe to me!« I cried. »I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips a sinner and I live among a people of unclean filthy lips speechlanguage. My eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand. With tongs he seized it from the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>He touched my mouth with it and said: »See! This has touched your lips, your guilt is taken away and your sin forgiven pardonedatoned for.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>I heard the voice of Jehovah. He said: »Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?« And I said: »Here I am. Send me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>He said: »Go and tell this people: Hear constantly but do not understand. See constantly but do not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>»This peoples heart has become calloused. They hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.« Septuagint</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said: »How long, O Jehovah? And He answered: »Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, until the houses are deserted and the land is utterly desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>»Until Jehovah has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>»Even if one out of ten people are left it will be destroyed burned again. When a strong tree or an oak is cut down, a stump is left. The holy seed is the stump.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>

        <verse osisID='Isa.24.22'>They will be gathered like prisoners in the dungeon tower. They will be confined in prison and after many days they will be punished.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'>O Jehovah, why do you let us wander from your ways and become so stubborn that we are unable to respect you? Return for the sake of your servants. They are the tribes that belong to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'>Your holy people possessed the land for a little while. Our enemies have trampled on your holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'>We have become like those whom you never ruled, like those who are not called by your name.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.64'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>O that you would split open the heavens and come down! The mountains would quake at your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>Be like the fire that kindles brushwood and makes water boil. Come down to make your name known to your enemies. The nations may tremble in your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When you did awe-inspiring things that we did not expect, you came down and the mountains quaked at your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>No one has ever heard and no one has paid attention. No one has perceived any god except you. You help those who wait for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>You greeted the one who gladly does right and remembers your ways. You were angry because we sinned. We continued to sin for a long time. Can we still be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>All of us have become unclean, and all our righteous acts are like permanently stained rags. All of us wither like leaves, and our sins carry us away like the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'>No one calls on your name or tries to hold on to you. You have hidden your face from us. You allowed us be ruined by our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'>But now, Jehovah, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you are our potter. We are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'>Do not be too angry, Jehovah. Do not remember our sin forever. Now look, we are all your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'>Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a desert. Jerusalem is a wasteland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'>Our holy and beautiful Temple where our ancestors praised you has been burned to the ground. All that we valued has been ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.12'>Despite these things, Jehovah, will you restrain yourself? Will you be silent and make us suffer beyond measure?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>»I permitted myself to be sought by those who did not ask for me. Those who did not seek me found me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said: Here I am, here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>»All day long I held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations thoughts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>»a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>»They sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil. They eat the flesh of pigs. Their pots are full of unclean meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>»They say: Keep away! Do not come near me, for I am too sacred for you! Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>»See, it stands written before me. I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>both your sins and the sins of your fathers, says Jehovah. This is because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills. I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Jehovah says: »As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, Do not destroy it, there is yet some good in it, so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains. My chosen people will inherit them and my servants will live there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>»But as for you who forsake Jehovah and forget my holy mountain, which spread a table for the God of Fortune Babylonian diety and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>»I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bend down for the slaughter! I called but you did not answer. I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: My servants will eat, but you will go hungry. My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty. My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse. The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of amen, so be it truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>»Behold! I WILL CREATE A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>»Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>»I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people. The sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>»Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years. He who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth. The sinner who reaches a hundred will be considered accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>»They will build houses and dwell in them. They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>This is what Jehovah says: »Heaven is my throne. Earth is my footstool. Where can you people build a house or resting place for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>»I have made all these things. That is why all these things have come into being,« declares Jehovah. »I will pay attention to those who are humble and sorry for their sins and who tremble at my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>»Whoever kills a bull is like someone who kills a person. Whoever sacrifices a lamb is like someone who breaks a dog's neck. Whoever offers a grain sacrifice is like someone who offers pig's blood. Whoever burns incense is like someone who worships an idol. People have certainly chosen their own ways, and they delight in detestable things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>»Therefore I will choose harsh treatment for them and bring on them what they fear. I called, but no one answered. I spoke, but they did not listen. They did what I consider evil. They chose what I do not like.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>»Listen to the word of Jehovah, all who tremble at his word. Your brothers, who hate you, exclude you because of my name. They say: Let Jehovah show his glory and then we will see your joy. But they will be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>»Listen to the uproar from the city. Listen to the sound from the temple. It is the sound of Jehovah paying back his enemies as they deserve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>»Before a woman goes into labor, she gives birth. Before she has labor pains, she delivers a male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>»Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a country be born in one day? Can a nation be born in a moment? When Zion went into labor, she also gave birth to her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>»Do I bring a mother to the moment of birth and not let her deliver?« Asks Jehovah. »Do I cause a mother to deliver and then make her unable to have children?« Asks your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>»All who love Jerusalem, be happy and rejoice with her. All who mourn for her be glad with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>»You will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breasts. You will nurse and be satisfied at her full breasts.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>This is what Jehovah says: »I will offer you peace like a river and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream. You will nurse and be carried in Jerusalem's arms and cuddled on her knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>»As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you. You will be comforted in Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>When you see it, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like new grass. The power of Jehovah will be made known to his servants, but he will condemn his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>Jehovah will come with fire and with his chariots like a thunderstorm. He will pay them back with his burning anger and punish them with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>Jehovah will judge with fire, and he will judge all people with his sword. Jehovah will strike many people dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>»People make themselves holy and prepare themselves for their garden rituals. They go into the garden and devour pork, disgusting things, and mice. They will come to an end at the same time, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>»Because of their actions and their thoughts, I am coming to gather the nations of every language. They will come and see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>»I will set up a sign among them and send some of their survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and to the distant coastlands who have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will tell about my glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>They will bring all your brothers from every nation like a grain offering to Jehovah. They will come on horses, in chariots, in wagons, on mules and camels to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, declares Jehovah. They will come like the people of Israel who bring their grain offerings in clean dishes to Jehovahs temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>»I will make some of them priests and Levites, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>»The new heaven and earth that I am about to make will continue in my presence,« declares Jehovah. »So your descendants and your name will also continue in my presence.</verse>
