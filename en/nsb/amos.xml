        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>»The lion has roared. Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken! Who will not prophesy?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>»Publish it in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt. Proclaim and assemble on the mountains of Samaria, and observe the great trouble and oppression there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>»Travel to Calneh and observe. From there go to the great Hamath. Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better off than these kingdoms? Is their territory greater than your territory?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>»You lie on beds of ivory, and stretch on couches. You eat the the best lambs out of the flock and the fattest calves out of the stall.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>»Therefore you will be captured with the first that go captive. Your feasting and lounging will pass away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by himself. Jehovah, the God of Hosts declares: »I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces. Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>»It will happen! If there remain ten men in one house, they will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>»When a man's uncle takes the body to be burned and brings the bones out of the house he will say to the innermost parts of the house: Is there yet any one here? And he will say, No. Then he will say: Hold your peace.

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>»For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel,« said Jehovah, the God of Hosts. »They will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>This is what the Lord Jehovah showed me: Behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop. It was the later growth second crop after the kings mowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>It happened when they quit eating the grass of the land. I said, »O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I entreat you: how shall Jacob stand? Since he is so small.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>Jehovah changed his mind about this. »It will not be,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>The Lord Jehovah showed me and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called for judgement contention by fire and it devoured the great deep. It would have eaten up the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then I said, »O Lord Jehovah, cease, I plead with you: how can Jacob stand? After all he is small.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>Jehovah changed his mind concerning this: »This also will not be,« said the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>He showed me: and, behold, Jehovah stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And Jehovah asked me, »Amos, what do you see?« I said: »A plumb line.« Then Jehovah said: »Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not spare them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>»The high places of Isaac will be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste. I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: »Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>Amos said: »Jeroboam will die by the sword. Israel will surely be led away captive in exile out of his land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Amaziah said to Amos: »Go, run away, you seer. Go into the land of Judah. Eat bread and prophesy there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>»Do not prophesy any more at Bethel for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Amos told Amaziah, »I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son. I was a herdsman, and a grower of sycamore figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>»Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me: Go prophesy to my people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now hear the word of Jehovah: »You say, do not prophesy against Israel, and do not speak against the house of Isaac.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Jehovah proclaims: »Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be divided by measuring line. You will die in a land that is unclean. Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.1'>I saw Jehovah standing beside the altar. He said: »Strike the capitals that the thresholds may shake! Break them in pieces on the head of all of them and I will slay the last of them with the sword. Not one of them will get away. Not one of them will escape!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'>»Though they dig into the grave my hand will take them. Though they climb to heaven I will bring them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'>»Though they hide on top of Mount Carmel I will search and find them and take them from there. Though they hide from my sight on the bottom of the sea I will command the serpent to bite them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.4'>»Though they go into the captivity of their enemies I will command the sword, and it will slay them. I will set my eyes against them for evil, and not for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.5'>»For the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, is he who touches the land and it melts. All who live there will mourn. It will rise up like the River Nile, and will subside again, like the River of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>»He builds his chambers in the heavens. He founded his dome over the earth. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth. Jehovah is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'>»Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel?« Said Jehovah. »Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'>»Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom! Yet, I will destroy it from off the face of the earth! I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.9'>I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations! Like grain is sifted in a sieve, yet the least kernel will not fall on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.10'>»All the sinners of my people will die by the sword. They say: The evil will not overtake nor meet us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.11'>»In that day I will raise up the fallen tabernacle of David and close up the breaches. I will raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old.</verse>
