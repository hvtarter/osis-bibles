        <title>CREATION ACCOUNT</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>The earth was without form and empty. Darkness covered the deep water. The Spirit of God hovered over the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>Then God said: »Let there be light!« And there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>God saw that the light was good. God separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>God called the light day. He called the darkness night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>Then God said: »Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters. Let it separate the waters from the waters.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>God made the expanse. He separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>God called the expanse heaven. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>Then God said: »Let the waters below the atmosphere be gathered into one place. Let the dry land appear.« It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>God called the dry land earth. The gathering of the waters He called seas. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>Then God said: »Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them.« It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>There was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>Then God said: »Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>»Let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth.« It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>God made the two great lights. The sun was to govern the day. The moon was to govern the night. He made the stars also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>The lights were to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>God said: »Let the waters be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves in the waters after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>God blessed them and said: »Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>God said: »Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.« It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>God made the wild animals according to their kinds. He made the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>Then God said: »Let us make man in our image, in our likeness. Let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>God created man in his own image. In the image of God he created him. He created male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>God blessed them and said to them: »Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and dominate the birds of the air. Have dominion over every living creature that moves on the ground.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>Then God said: »I give you every plant that bears seed on the face of the entire earth. I also give you every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>»Also every beast of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground; everything that has the breath of life in it, I give every green plant for food.« It was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>God saw all that he had made. It was very good. There was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>The heavens and the earth and their immense arrangement were completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>By the seventh day God had finished his work. He rested from all his work on the seventh day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>God blessed the seventh day and made it holy. This is because he rested from all the work of creation he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>This is the account of when Jehovah God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>No shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth. No plant of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not sent rain on the earth. There was no man to work the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>Mist came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>Jehovah God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. The man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>Now Jehovah God planted a garden in the east, in Eden. He put the man he had formed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>Jehovah God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground, trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden. From there it was separated into four headwaters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first river is the Pishon. It winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>The gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>The name of the second river is the Gihon. It winds through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>The name of the third river is the Tigris. It runs along the east side of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>Jehovah God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>Jehovah God commanded the man: »You are free to eat from any tree in the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>»But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When you eat of it you will surely die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>Jehovah God said: »It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>Then Jehovah God formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to let him name them. Whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But no suitable helper was found for Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. While he was sleeping, he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>Then Jehovah made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man. He brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>The man said: »This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman. This is because she was taken out of Man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>This is the reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife. They will become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <title>ADAM AND EVE SIN</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was craftier than any of the wild animals Jehovah God had made. He said to the woman: »Did God really say, you must not eat from any tree in the garden?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>The woman said to the serpent: »We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>»However, God did say: You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not touch it, or you will die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>»You will not die,« the serpent said to the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>»God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened. Then you will be like God, knowing good and evil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>Then the eyes of both of them were opened. They realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>The man and his wife heard the sound voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day. They hid from Jehovah, among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>But Jehovah God called to the man: »Where are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>He Adam answered: »I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said: »Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>Adam said: »The woman you put here with me gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>Then Jehovah God said to the Eve: »What is this you have done?« The woman answered: »The serpent deceived me, and I ate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>So Jehovah God said to the serpent: »Because you have done this you are cursed above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>»And I will put enmity hostilityhatred between you and the woman, and between your offspring seed and hers. He will bruise overwhelmcrush you in the head, and you will bruise overwhelmcrush him in the heel.« (Romans 16:20)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>He said to the woman: »I will greatly increase your pains in childbirth; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>He said to Adam: »Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, You must not eat of it, cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>»It will produce thorns and thistles for you. You will eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>»You will eat your food by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground. You came from the ground. For dust you are and to dust you will return.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>Jehovah God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>Jehovah said: »The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore Jehovah God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <title>CAIN AND ABEL</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>Adam had sexual intercourse with his wife Eve. She became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said: »With the help of Jehovah I have brought forth a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>As time went by, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn firstlings of his flock. Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and his offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his face was downcast he had a bad attitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>Jehovah said to Cain: »Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>»If you do what is right, will not your attitude improve? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door. It desires to have you, but you must master it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>Jehovah asked Cain: »Where is your brother Abel?« »I do not know,« he replied. »Am I my brothers keeper?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>Jehovah said: »What have you done? Listen! Your brothers blood life cries out to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>»Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>»When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer vagabond on the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>Cain said to Jehovah: »My punishment is more than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>»You are driving me from the land today. I will be hidden from your presence. I will be a restless homeless wanderer on the earth. And whoever finds me will kill me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>Jehovah replied to him: »If anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.« Then Jehovah put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>Cain went out from Jehovahs presence and lived in the land of Nod Fugitiveness. Nod is east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>Cain had intercourse with his wife. She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Later Cain built a city. He named it after his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>His brothers name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of copper and iron. Tubal-Cains sister was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>Lamech said to his wives: »Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>»If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>Adam had intercourse with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth. She said: »God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on proclaim the name of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.12.2'>»I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you. I will make your name great. You will be a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.3'>»I will bless those who bless you. I will curse whoever curses you. All the people on earth will be blessed through you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.4'>So Abram left, just as Jehovah told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.5'>He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran. They set out for the land of Canaan and soon arrived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.6'>Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great oak tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.7'>Jehovah appeared to Abram and said: »I will give this land to your offspring seed.« He built an altar there to Jehovah, who had appeared to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.8'>From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent. Bethel was on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.9'>Abram continued toward the Negev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.10'>There was a famine in the land. Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while, because the famine was severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.11'>He was about to enter Egypt. He said to his wife Sarai: »I know what a beautiful woman you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.12'>»When the Egyptians see you, they will say: This is his wife. Then they will kill me, but will let you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.13'>»Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake, and my life will be spared because of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.14'>When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.15'>Pharaohs officials saw her. They praised her to Pharaoh. She was taken into his palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.16'>He treated Abram well for her sake. Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.17'>Jehovah inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abrams wife Sarai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.18'>So Pharaoh summoned Abram. »What have you done to me?« he asked. »Why did you not tell me she was your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.19'>»Why did you say: She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.12.20'>Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.13'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.1'>Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.2'>Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.3'>He traveled from place to place from the Negev until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.4'>This was where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.5'>Lot moved about with Abram. He also had flocks and herds and tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.6'>But the land could not support them while they stayed together. Their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.7'>Quarreling arose between Abrams herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.8'>Abram said to Lot: »Let us not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.9'>»Is not the whole land before you? Let us part company. If you go to the left, I will go to the right. If you go to the right, I will go to the left.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.10'>Lot looked up and saw that the district of the Jordan River was well watered, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. This was before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.11'>So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.12'>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.13'>The men of Sodom were wicked and sinned greatly against Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.14'>After Lot had parted from Abram, Jehovah said to Abram: »Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.15'>»All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring descendants from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.16'>»I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth. If anyone could count the dust, your offspring could be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.17'>»Go walk through the length and breadth of the land that I am giving to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.13.18'>Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron. He built an altar to Jehovah there.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.14'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.1'>In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.2'>these four kings made war with King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Zoar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.3'>These joined forces in the Valley of Siddim at the Dead Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.4'>They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years. They rebelled in the thirteenth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.5'>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.6'>and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.7'>They turned back and came to En-mishpat Kadesh, and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.8'>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Zoar went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.9'>They fought against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.10'>The Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen tar pits. As the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them. The rest fled to the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.11'>The enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food provisions, and went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.12'>They also captured Lot, son of Abrams brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.13'>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. They were Abrams allies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.14'>Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive. Abram led his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, in pursuit as far as Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.15'>He divided his forces against them by night. He and his servants routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.16'>Then he brought back all the goods. He also brought back his nephew Lot and all the men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.17'>As soon as the king of Sodom returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, he went out to meet Abram at the King's Valley of Shaveh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.18'>King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.19'>He blessed him and said: »Blessed be Abram by God Most High, maker of heaven and earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.20'>»Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!« Abram gave him one tenth of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.21'>Then the king of Sodom said to Abram: »Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.22'>But Abram said to the king of Sodom: »I have sworn to Jehovah, God Most High, maker of heaven and earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.23'>"I will take nothing. Not a thread or a sandal strap. You will not be able to say: 'I have made Abram rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.24'>»Let the young men who came with me take their portion: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.15'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.1'>The word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision: »Do not be afraid, Abram; I am your shield. Your reward shall be very great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.2'>Abram said: »O Jehovah God, what will you give me? I continue childless! The heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.3'>Abram also said: »You have given me no offspring. So a slave born in my house is to be my heir.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.4'>The word of Jehovah came to him: »This man shall not be your heir. No one but your very own issue shall be your heir.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.5'>He brought him outside and said: »Look toward heaven and count the stars. Are you able to count them?« He continued: »So shall your descendants be.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.6'>He believed in Jehovah. Jehovah considered Abrams faith as his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.7'>Then God said to him: »I AM JEHOVAH, who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.8'>Abram replied: »O Jehovah God, how will I know that I shall possess it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.9'>He God said to him: »Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.10'>Abram brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other. He did not cut the birds in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.11'>When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.12'>As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.13'>Jehovah said to Abram: »Know this for sure; your offspring will be strangers aliens in a land that is not theirs. They will be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.14'>»I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve! Afterward they will come out with great possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.15'>»As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace. You shall be buried at a good old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.16'>»They shall come back here in the fourth generation. The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.17'>The sun went down and it was dark. A smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.18'>On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram. He said: »To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.19'>the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.20'>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.21'>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.16'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.1'>Sarai, Abrams wife, had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.2'>She said to Abram: »Jehovah has kept me from having children. Go sleep with my maidservant. Perhaps I can build a family through her.« Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.3'>After Abram lived in Canaan ten years, Sarai, his wife, gave her Egyptian maidservant Hagar to her husband to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.4'>Abram had intercourse with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.5'>Then Sarai said to Abram: »You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms; she knows she is pregnant and she despises me. May Jehovah judge between you and me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.6'>»Your servant is in your hands,« Abram said. »Do with her whatever you think best.« Then Sarai mistreated Hagar. So she ran away from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.7'>The angel of Jehovah found Hagar near a spring in the desert. It was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.8'>He said: »Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?« »I am running away from my mistress Sarai,« she answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.9'>Then the angel of Jehovah told her: »Go back to your mistress and submit to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.10'>»I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.11'>Jehovahs angel also said: »You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael means: God hears. Jehovah has heard of your misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.12'>»He Ishmael will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone and everyones hand against him. He will live in hostility toward all his brothers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.13'>She called the name of Jehovah, who spoke to her: »You are the God who sees me, for she said, I have not seen the one who sees me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.14'>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. It is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.15'>Hagar bore Abram a son. Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.16'>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.17'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.1'>Abram was ninety-nine years old. Jehovah appeared to him and said: »I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.2'>»I will establish my covenant between us. I will greatly increase your numbers.«</verse>
        <title>ABRAHAM TO BE FATHER OF MANY NATIONS</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.3'>Abram fell on his face and God said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.4'>»This is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.5'>»You will no longer be called Abram Exalted Father. Your name will be Abraham means Father of Many. I have made you a father of many nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.17.9'>Then God said to Abraham: »As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.10'>»This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.17.14'>»Any male not circumcised in the flesh will be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.15'>God continued: »Do not call your wife Sarai any longer. Her name will be Sarah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.16'>»I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.17'>Abraham fell to his face. He laughed and said to himself: »Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.18'>Abraham said to God: »If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.19'>God replied: »Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son! You will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as a long lasting covenant for his descendants after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.20'>»Concerning Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him. I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.17.22'>When he finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.17.23'>On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.17.25'>His son Ishmael was thirteen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.18'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.1'>Jehovah appeared again to Abraham by the oak grove of Mamre. He was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.2'>He looked up and noticed three men coming toward him. He ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.3'>Abraham said: »My Lord, if I have now found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.4'>»Please. Let a little water be brought. Wash your feet and rest under the tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.5'>»I will bring a bite to eat to refresh you. Stay a while before you continue your journey.« They responded: »Very well, do as you have said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.6'>Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said: »Quick! Make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.7'>Then Abraham ran to the herd. He selected a fat calf and told a servant to butcher it and prepare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.8'>He took butter and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree as they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.9'>Then they said to him: »Where is Sarah your wife« ? He responded: »Here, in the tent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.10'>He said: »Next year I will give you and Sarah a son.« Sarah was listening in the tent door behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.11'>Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.12'>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself. She said to herself: "After I have grown old, shall I have a baby? My lord is old also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.13'>Jehovah said to Abraham: »Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.16'>Then the men stood up from their meal and started in the direction of Sodom. Abraham went with them to send them on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.17'>Jehovah said: »Shall I hide what I am doing from Abraham?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.25'>»Surely you would not do that! Would you slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked? Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.26'>Jehovah said: »If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, I will spare the entire place for their sakes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.27'>Then Abraham answered and said: »Indeed now, I who am only dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.28'>»Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous. Would you destroy the entire city for lack of five?« So He God said: »If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.29'>Abraham spoke again: »Suppose there should be forty found there?« God replied: »I will not do it for the sake of forty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.30'>Abraham then said: »Do not be angry, and let me speak. Suppose thirty should be found there?« God replied: »I will not do it if I find thirty there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.31'>Abraham then said: »Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah: Suppose twenty should be found there?« God replied: »I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.32'>Abraham again queried: »Please do not be angry as I speak once more: Suppose ten should be found there?« God said: »I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.33'>Jehovah went his way as soon as he finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his place.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.19'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.1'>That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting there as they arrived. When he saw them, he got up to greet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed low to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.2'>»My lords,« he said, »come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may get up in the morning as early as you like and be on your way again.« »Oh no,« they said, »We will spend the night out here in the city square.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.3'>Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. He set a great feast before them, complete with fresh unleavened unfermented bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.4'>They prepared to retire for the night when suddenly all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.5'>They shouted to Lot: »Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out so we can have sex with them!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.6'>Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.7'>»Please, my brothers,« he begged, »do not do such a wicked thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.8'>»I have two virgin daughters. Do with them as you wish, but leave these men alone, for they are under my protection.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.9'>»Stand back!« they shouted. »Who do you think you are? We let you settle among us, and now you are trying to tell us what to do! We will treat you far worse than those other men!« They pushed Lot and began breaking down the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.10'>But the two angels reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.11'>Then they blinded the men of Sodom so they could not find the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.12'>»Do you have any other relatives here in the city?« The angels asked. »Get them out of this place, sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.13'>»We will destroy the city completely. The stench of the place has reached Jehovah. He has sent us to destroy it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.14'>Lot rushed out to tell his sons-in-law: »Hurry! Get out of the city! Jehovah is going to destroy it.« But the young men thought he was only joking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.15'>At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent. They said to Lot: »Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here. Get out of here right now, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.16'>Lot still hesitated. So the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city, for Jehovah was merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.17'>»Run for your lives!« The angels warned. »Do not stop and do not look behind you! Escape to the mountains, or you will die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.18'>»Oh no, my lords, please,« Lot begged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.19'>»You have been so kind to me and saved my life, and you have granted me such mercy. But I cannot go to the mountains. Disaster would catch up to me there, and I would soon die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.20'>»There is a small village nearby. Please let me go there instead. Do you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.21'>The angel said to him: »All right, I will grant you this request too. I will not destroy the city you are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.22'>»Run there quickly! I cannot do anything until you get there." The city is named Zoar Small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.23'>The sun had just risen over the land as Lot came to Zoar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.24'>Jehovah made burning sulfur and fire rain out of the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.25'>He destroyed those cities, the whole Plain, all who lived in the cities, and whatever grew on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.26'>Lots wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.27'>Early the next morning Abraham came to the place where he had stood in front of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.28'>He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land in the Plain. He saw smoke rising from the land like the thick smoke of a furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.29'>When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living, he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.30'>Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.31'>The older daughter said to her sister: »Our father is getting old. There are no men in the whole world to marry us so we can have children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.32'>»Come, let us get our father drunk. Then we can sleep with him and have children by him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.33'>That night they gave him wine to drink. The older daughter had intercourse with him. But he was so drunk that he did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.34'>The next day the older daughter said to her sister: »I slept with him last night. Let us get him drunk again tonight, and you sleep with him. Then each of us will have a child by our father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.35'>So that night they got him drunk. The younger daughter had intercourse with him. Again he was so drunk that he did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.36'>Both of Lots daughters became pregnant by their own father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.37'>The older daughter had a son, whom she named Moab. He was the ancestor of the present-day Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.38'>The younger daughter also had a son, whom she named Ben-ammi. He was the ancestor of the present-day Ammonites.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.20'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.1'>Abraham moved from Mamre to the southern part of Canaan and lived between Kadesh and Shur. Later, while he was living in Gerar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.2'>he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.3'>God appeared to the king in a dream and said: »You are going to die, because you have taken this woman. She is already married.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.4'>Abimelech had not come near her. He said: »Lord, I am innocent! Would you destroy my people and me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.5'>»Abraham said that she was his sister. She said the same thing. I did this with a clear conscience. I have done no wrong!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.6'>God said to him in a dream: »Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. In fact, I kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.7'>»Give the mans wife back to him now. He is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not give her back, you and all who belong to you are doomed to die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.8'>So Abimelech got up early in the morning. He called all his servants and told them everything. The men were very afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.9'>Then Abimelech called Abraham. He said to him: »What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you? You have brought a great sin on me and on my kingdom. You have done to me things that ought not to be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.10'>Abimelech also asked Abraham: »What were you thinking when you did this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.11'>Abraham said: »I thought that because there are no people who reverence God in this place, I would be killed because of my wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.12'>»Besides, she is my sister. She is my fathers daughter, but not my mothers. She is also my wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.13'>»When God had me leave my fathers home and travel around, I said to her: 'Do me a favor: Wherever we go, say that I am your brother.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.14'>Abimelech took sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.15'>Abimelech said: »Look, here is my land. Live anywhere you like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.16'>He said to Sarah: »Do not forget that I have given your brother twenty-five pounds of silver. This is to silence any criticism against you from everyone with you. You are completely cleared.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.17'>Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could have children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.18'>Jehovah had made it impossible for any woman in Abimelechs household to have children because of Abrahams wife Sarah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.21'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.1'>Jehovah was gracious to Sarah, as he had said. Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.2'>Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age. It was at the very time God had promised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.3'>Abraham gave the name Isaac he laughs to the son Sarah bore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.4'>When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.5'>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.6'>Sarah said: »God brought me laughter. Everyone who hears about this will laugh on account of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.7'>She added: »Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.8'>The child grew and was weaned. Abraham held a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.9'>Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was laughing in mockery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.10'>She said to Abraham: »Get rid of that slave woman and her son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.11'>This upset Abraham because of his son Ishmael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.12'>God said to Abraham: »Do not be upset about the boy and your slave. Listen to what Sarah says, because through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.13'>»I will make the slaves son into a nation also, because he is your child.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.14'>Early the next morning Abraham took bread and a container of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder. He also gave her the boy and sent her on her way. So she left and wandered around in the desert near Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.15'>When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.16'>She sat across from him at a distance. She thought: »I cannot watch the boy die." She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.17'>God heard the lad crying. The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her: »What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear! God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.18'>»Arise, lift up the lad. Hold him by the hand. I will make him a great nation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.19'>Then God opened her eyes. She saw a well of water. She filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.20'>God was with the lad, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.21'>He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.22'>Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham. They said: »God is with you in all that you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.23'>»Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity. Consider the kindness that I have shown to you. Please show it to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.24'>Abraham said: »I swear it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.25'>Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water that the servants of Abimelech had seized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.26'>Abimelech said: »I do not know who has done this thing. You did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.27'>Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.28'>Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.29'>Abimelech asked Abraham: »What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.30'>He said: »You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.31'>Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there the two of them took an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.32'>They made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.21.33'>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba. There he called on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.22.3'>Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey. He took two of his servants and his son Isaac with him. He had cut the wood for the burnt offering. Then he set out for the place that God had told him about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.4'>Two days later Abraham saw the place in the distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.5'>He said to the servants: »Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship. Then we will come back to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.6'>Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice. Abraham carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire. As they walked along together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.7'>Isaac spoke up: »Father!« He answered: »Yes, my son?« Isaac asked: »I see that you have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.8'>Abraham answered: »God will provide one.« And the two of them walked on together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.9'>They came to the place God had told him about. Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.10'>Then he picked up the knife to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.11'>Jehovahs angel shouted from heaven: »Abraham! Abraham!« »Here I am!« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.12'>»Do not hurt the boy or harm him in any way!« The angel said. »Now I know that you truly obey God, because you were willing to offer him your only son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.13'>Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes. So he took the ram and sacrificed it in place of his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.14'>Abraham named that place »Jehovah Will Provide.« It is still said today: »It will be provided on the mountain of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.15'>The angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from heaven a second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.16'>He said: »I am taking an oath on my own name, declares Jehovah, that because you have done this and have not refused to give me your son, your only son,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.26.6'>Isaac moved to Gerar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.7'>His wife Rebekah was very beautiful. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her. So he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.26.23'>He went from there to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.24'>That night Jehovah appeared to Isaac. Jehovah said: »I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, because I am with you. I will bless you and increase the number of your descendants for my servant Abrahams sake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.25'>Isaac built an altar there and worshiped Jehovah. Then he set up his camp. His servants dug another well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.26.30'>Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.31'>Early the next morning each man made his promise and sealed it with a vow. Isaac said good-bye to them. They parted as friends.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.27.23'>So Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.24'>Isaac asked: »Are you really my son Esau?« »Yes, I am,« Jacob answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.25'>So Isaac told him: »Serve me the wild meat. I can give you my blessing.« Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.26'>Then his father Isaac said to him: »Come close, my son, and kiss me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.27'>He came close and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his garments. Then he blessed him and said: »See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field Jehovah has blessed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.28'>»May God give you of the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.29'>»May peoples serve you. And nations bow down to you. Be master of your brothers. And may your mothers sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you. Blessed be those who bless you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.30'>No sooner had Isaac finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob left his presence, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.31'>He also prepared a good-tasting meal and brought it to his father. Then he said to his father: »Please, Father, eat some of the meat I have hunted for you so that you will bless me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.32'>»Who are you?« his father Isaac asked him. »I am your firstborn son, Esau,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.33'>Isaac began to tremble and shake all over. He asked: »Who was it, then, who killed an animal and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came. I gave him my final blessing, and so it is his forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.34'>When Esau heard this he cried out loudly and bitterly. He said: »Give me your blessing also, Father!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.35'>Isaac responded: »Your brother deceived me. He has taken your blessing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.36'>Esau said: »This is the second time that he has cheated me. No wonder his name is Jacob. He took my rights as the firstborn son. Now he has taken my blessing. Have you saved a blessing for me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.37'>Isaac answered: »I have already made him master over you. I have made all his relatives his slaves. I have given him grain and wine. Now there is nothing that I can do for you, son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.38'>Esau pleaded: »Father, please! Do you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!« Esau broke down and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.39'>Then Isaac said to him: »You will live off the land and what it yields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.40'>»You will live by your sword. You will serve your brother. Soon you will become restless and break his yoke from your neck.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.41'>So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. Esau said to himself: »The days of mourning for my father are near. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.42'>When Rebekah heard about Esaus plans to kill Jacob, she called her younger son, Jacob. She said: »Your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.43'>»Go quickly, my son. Run away to my brother Laban in Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.44'>»Stay with him until your brothers anger cools down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.45'>»When your brothers anger is gone and he has forgotten what you did to him, I will let you know. Then you may come back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.46'>Rebekah said to Isaac: »I cannot stand Hittite women! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.28'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.1'>Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and told him: »Do not marry a Canaanite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.2'>»Go to Mesopotamia instead, to the home of your grandfather Bethuel. Marry one of the young women there, one of your uncle Labans daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.3'>»Almighty God will bless your marriage and give you many children. You will become the father of many nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.4'>»He will bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham. You may take possession of this land, in which you have lived and which God gave to Abraham!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.5'>Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekahs brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.6'>Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learned that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.7'>Jacob did as his father and mother said. He went to Paddan-aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.8'>It was clear to Esau that his father despised the local Canaanite women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.9'>So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abrahams son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.10'>Jacob left Beer-sheba and traveled toward Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.11'>As soon as the sun went down he stopped for the night. He took one of the stones from that place, put it under his head, and lay down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.12'>He had a dream in which he saw a stairway set up on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven. He saw the angels of God going up and coming down on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.13'>Jehovah was standing above the stairway. He proclaimed: »I am Jehovah, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give the land on which you are lying to you and your descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.14'>»Your descendants will be like the dust on the earth. You will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. Every family on earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.15'>»Remember, I am with you. I will watch over you wherever you go. I will also bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I do what I have promised you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.16'>Jacob woke up from his sleep and said: »Truly, Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.17'>He was filled with reverence. He said: »This is an awesome place! Certainly, this is the house of God and the gateway to the heavens!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.18'>Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had under his head. He set it up as a marker and poured oil on top of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.19'>He named that place Bethel House of God. Previously, the name of the city was Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.20'>Jacob made a vow. He said: »If God will be with me and will watch over me on my trip and give me food to eat and clothes to wear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.21'>»and if I return safely to my fathers home, then Jehovah will be my God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.29'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.1'>Jacob continued on his trip and arrived at the land in the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.2'>Suddenly he came upon a well out in the fields. There were three flocks of sheep lying around it. The flocks were watered from this well. It had a large stone over the opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.3'>When all the flocks came together there, the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them. Then they would put the stone back in place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.4'>Jacob asked the shepherds: »Where are you from?« They answered: »We are from Haran.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.5'>Then he asked: »Do you know Nahors grandson Laban?« »Yes, we do,« they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.6'>Jacob asked: »How is he?« They replied: »He is well. Here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.7'>»It is still the heat of the day. It is not time for livestock to be gathered. Would you like to water the sheep so they can get back to grazing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.8'>They said: »We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.9'>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.10'>Jacob saw Rachel, daughter of his uncle Laban, with his uncle Labans sheep. He came forward and rolled the stone off the opening of the well and watered his uncle Labans sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.11'>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.12'>Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers nephew and that he was Rebekahs son. She ran and told her father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.13'>As soon as Laban heard the news about his sisters son Jacob, he ran to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him into his home. Then Jacob told Laban all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.14'>Laban said: »You are indeed my own flesh and blood.« Jacob stayed there a whole month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.15'>Laban said to Jacob: »You should not work for me for nothing just because you are my relative. How much pay do you want?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.16'>Laban had two daughters. The older was named Leah and the younger Rachel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.17'>Leah had soft eyes and Rachel was shapely and very beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.18'>Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said: »I will work seven years for you, if you will let me marry Rachel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.19'>Laban answered: »It is better that I give her to you than to anyone else. Stay here with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.20'>Jacob worked seven years for Laban. The time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.21'>Jacob said to Laban: »Give me my wife for the time is completed. I want to marry Rachel now!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.22'>Laban gathered all the men of the place and gave a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.23'>In the evening when it was dark, he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him. Jacob slept with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.24'>Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her maid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.25'>»What have you done to me?« Jacob asked Laban: »Did I work for you in return for Rachel? Why did you cheat me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.26'>Laban answered: »It is not our custom to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.27'>»Finish the week of wedding festivities with this daughter. Then we will give you the other one too. But you will have to work for me another seven years.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.28'>Jacob did that. He finished the week with Leah. Then Laban gave his daughter Rachel to him as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.29'>Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.30'>Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.31'>Jehovah saw that Leah was loved less, so he made it possible for her to have children. But Rachel had none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.32'>Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, because she said: »Certainly, Jehovah has seen my misery. Now my husband will love me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.33'>She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »Certainly, Jehovah has heard that I am unloved. He has also given me this son.« She named him Simeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.34'>She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have given him three sons.« She named him Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.35'>Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: »This time I will praise Jehovah.« So she named him Judah Praise. Then she stopped having children.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.30'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.1'>Rachel had not borne Jacob any children. As a result, she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob: »Give me children, or I will die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.2'>Jacob became angry with Rachel. He said: »I cannot take the place of God. He is the one who keeps you from having children.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.3'>She said: »Here is my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her, so that she can have a child for me. This way I can become a mother through her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.4'>Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah. Jacob slept with Bilhah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.5'>They had a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.6'>Rachel named him Dan, because she said: »God has answered my prayers. He has vindicated me and given me a son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.7'>Bilhah and Jacob had a second son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.8'>Rachel said: »I have struggled hard with my sister, and I have won!« So she named the boy Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.9'>When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.10'>They had a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.11'>Leah said: »How fortunate. She called him Gad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.12'>Leahs slave Zilpah gave birth to her second son for Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.13'>Leah said: »I am happy, for women will call me blessed. So she named him Asher.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.14'>During the wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields. He found some mandrake plants. He brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah: »Please, give me some of your sons mandrake plants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.15'>Leah replied: »Is it not enough that you took my husband? Are you also going to take my sons mandrake plants?« Rachel responded: »Very well, Jacob can go to bed with you tonight in return for your sons mandrake plants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.16'>Jacob came in from the fields that evening. Leah went out to meet him. »You are to sleep with me,« she said. »You are my reward for my sons mandrake plants.« So he went to bed with her that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.17'>God answered Leahs prayer. She became pregnant and gave birth to her fifth son for Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.18'>Leah said: »God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband.« So she named him Issachar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.19'>She became pregnant again and gave birth to her sixth son for Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.20'>Leah said: »God has presented me with a wonderful gift. This time my husband will honor me, because I have given him six sons.« So she named him Zebulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.21'>Later she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.22'>Then God remembered Rachel. God listened to her and opened her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.23'>So she conceived and gave birth to a son. She said: »God has taken away my reproach.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.24'>She named him Joseph. She said: »May Jehovah give me another son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.25'>When Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban: »Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.26'>»Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you. Let me depart. For you know how much service I have done for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.27'>But Laban said: »If now it pleases you, stay with me. I have observed that Jehovah has blessed me on your account.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.28'>He continued: »Name your wages, and I will pay.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.29'>Jacob responded: »You know how much work I have done for you and what has happened to your livestock under my care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.30'>»The little that you had before I came has grown to a large amount. Jehovah has blessed you wherever I have been. When may I do something for my own family?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.31'>Laban asked: »What should I give you?« Jacob answered: »Do not give me anything. Instead, do something for me. Then I will go back to taking care of and watching your flocks again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.32'>»Let me go through all of your flocks today and take every speckled and spotted sheep, every black lamb, and every spotted and speckled goat. They will be my wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.33'>»My honesty will speak for itself whenever you come to check on my wages. Any goat I have that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not black will be considered stolen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.34'>Laban answered: »I agree; we will do as you have said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.35'>Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats, all the speckled and spotted female goats every one with white on it, and every black lamb. He had his sons take charge of them that same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.36'>They moved away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Labans flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.37'>Jacob took green branches of poplar storax, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.38'>He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.39'>So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.40'>Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Labans flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Labans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.41'>When the strongest of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.42'>When the flock was feeble, he did not put them in. That way the feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.43'>He became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.31'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.1'>Jacob heard that Labans sons were saying: »Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father. He has gained all his wealth from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.2'>He also noticed that Laban did not appear as friendly to him as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.3'>Jehovah said to Jacob: »Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your relatives. I will be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.4'>Then Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah to come out to the open country where his flocks were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.5'>He said to them: »I have seen that your fathers attitude toward me is not as friendly as before. The God of my father has been with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.18'>He drove all his livestock ahead of him. He took all the possessions that he had accumulated. He took his own livestock that he had accumulated in Paddan-aram and went back to his father Isaac in Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.19'>When Laban went to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her fathers household idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.20'>Jacob also tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.21'>He left in a hurry with all that belonged to him. He crossed the Euphrates River and went toward the mountains of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.22'>Three days after he left, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.23'>Laban took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.30'>»It appears that you are going because your hearts desire is for your fathers house. But why have you taken my gods?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.31'>Jacob answered Laban: »I was afraid you might take your daughters from me by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>»As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death. Make a search in front of us all for what is yours, and take it.« Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>So Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there. He left Leahs tent and went into Rachels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>Rachel took the images. She put them in the camels basket and was seated on them. Laban searched through the tent and did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>Rachel said to her father: »Do not be angry, Father, but I cannot get up to greet you. I am having my period.« So even though Laban had made a thorough search, he did not find the idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>Jacob lost his temper. »What crime have I committed?« he asked angrily. »What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>»Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it. Let them decide which one of us is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>»I have been with you now for twenty years. Your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce. I have not even eaten any rams from your flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.39'>»I always absorbed the loss when wild animals killed a sheep. I did not take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.40'>»Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>»I have been in your house twenty years! I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters. I kept your flock for six years. You changed my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>»If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, out of respect for Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed by now. God has seen my misery and hard work. Last night he made it right!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>Then Laban answered Jacob: »These are my daughters, my grandchildren, and my flocks. Everything you see is mine! Yet, what can I do today for my daughters or for their children?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>»Now, let us make an agreement covenant and let it stand as a witness between you and me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>Jacob took a stone and set it up as a marker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>Jacob said to his relatives: »Gather some stones.« They took stones, put them into a pile, and ate there by the pile of stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.47'>In his language, Laban called it »Jegar Sahadutha« Witness Pile, but Jacob called it »Galeed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.48'>Laban said: »This pile of stones stands as a witness between you and me today.« This is why it was named Galeed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.49'>and also Mizpah Watchtower, because he said: »May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are unable to see each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.50'>»If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women behind my back, remember that God stands as a witness between you and me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.51'>Laban also said to Jacob: »Here is the pile of stones. Here is the marker that I have set up between you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.52'>»This pile of stones and this marker stand as witnesses that I will not go past the pile of stones to harm you, and that you will not go past the pile of stones or marker to harm me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>»May the God of Abraham and Nahorthe God of their fatherjudge between us.« So Jacob swore this oath out of respect for his father Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.54'>He offered a sacrifice on the mountain. He invited his relatives to eat the meal with him. They ate with him and spent the night on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.55'>Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and went back home.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.32'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.1'>Along the way Gods angels met Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.2'>When he saw them, Jacob said: »This is Gods camp!« He named that place Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.3'>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in Seir, the country of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.4'>He informed them to say: »Your obedient servant, Jacob, reports to my master Esau that I have been staying with Laban and that I have delayed my return until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.5'>»I own cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and slaves. I am sending you word in the hope of gaining your favor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.6'>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said: »We went to your brother Esau. He is already on his way to meet you. He has four hundred men with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.7'>Jacob was frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided his sheep, goats, cattle, and camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.8'>He thought: »If Esau comes and attacks the first group, the other may be able to escape.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>Then Jacob prayed: »O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you said to me: Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>»I am less than nothing in comparison with all your love and your faithfulness to me your servant. I only had a stick in my hand when I traveled across Jordan. Now I have become two armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>»Save me from the hand of Esau, my brother. I fear that he will attack me and kill both mothers and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.12'>»You said, I will make sure that you are prosperous and that your descendants will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. No one will be able to count them because there are so many.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>Jacob stayed there that night. Then he prepared a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>There were two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.15'>also thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.16'>He placed servants in charge of each herd. He said to his servants: »Go ahead of me, and maintain a distance between the herds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>He commanded the first servant: »When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and whose animals are these ahead of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>»Say, They belong to your servant Jacob. This is a gift sent to you. Jacob is directly behind us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>He also commanded the second servant, the third, and all the others who followed the herds. He said: »Say the same thing to Esau when you find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.20'>»Be sure to say, Jacob is right behind us.« He thought: »I will make peace with him by giving him this gift that I am sending ahead of me. After that, I will see him, and he will welcome me back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.21'>Jacob sent the gift ahead of him, while he stayed in the camp that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.22'>That same night Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two concubines, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.23'>After he sent them across, he also sent across all that he owned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.24'>Then Jacob was by himself. A man was fighting with him till dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.25'>The man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob. He gave him a blow in the hollow part of his thigh, so that his leg was damaged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.26'>He said to him: »Let me go now, for the dawn is near.« But Jacob said: »I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.27'>Then he asked: »What is your name?« And he said, »Jacob.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.28'>The man said: »Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel He Struggles With God, because you have struggled with God and with menand you have won.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.29'>Jacob said: »Please tell me your name.« The man answered: »Why do you ask for my name?« Then he blessed Jacob there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.30'>Jacob named that place Peniel Face of God, because he said: »I have seen God face to face, yet my life was saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.31'>The sun rose as he passed Penuel. He was limping because of his thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.32'>Therefore, even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle of the thigh the sinew attached to the hip socket. This is because God touched the socket of Jacobs thigh at the muscle.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.33'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.1'>Jacob saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. Therefore he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two concubines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.2'>He put the concubines and their children first, then Leah and her children, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.3'>Jacob went ahead of them. He bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.4'>Esau ran to meet him. He threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They both cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.5'>Esau looked around and saw the women and the children. He asked: »Who are these people with you?« Jacob answered: »These are the children whom God has been good enough to give me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.6'>Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.7'>Leah and her children came next, and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.8'>Esau asked: »What about that other group I met? What do you mean by all this company?« Jacob answered: »It was to gain your favor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.9'>»But, brother, I already have plenty,« Esau replied. »Keep them for yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.10'>Jacob said: »Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.11'>»Take my offering then, with my blessing. God has been very good to me and I have enough.« So at his strong request, he took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.12'>Esau said: »Let us go on our journey together. I will go in front.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.13'>Jacob responded: »My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are a care to me. If they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.14'>»Please let my lord pass on before his servant. I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.15'>Esau said: »Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.« But he said: »What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.16'>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.17'>Jacob moved on to Succoth. He built a house there for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is named Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.18'>Jacob traveled safely from Paddan-aram to the city of Shechem in Canaan. He camped within sight of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.19'>He bought the piece of land on which he pitched his tents. He bought it from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.20'>He set up an altar there and named it God, the God of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.34'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.1'>One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the Canaanite women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.2'>Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, who was chief of that region, saw her. He grabbed her and raped sexually defiled her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.3'>He found the young woman so attractive that he fell in love with her. So he tried to win her affection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.4'>He told his father: »I want you to get Dinah for me as my wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.5'>Jacob learned that his daughter had been disgraced. Since his sons were out in the fields with his livestock, he did nothing until they came back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.6'>Shechems father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.7'>About that time Jacobs sons were coming in from the fields. When they heard about it, they were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a thing. He had insulted the people of Israel by raping Jacobs daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.8'>Hamor said to him: »My son Shechem has fallen in love with your daughter. Please let him marry her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.9'>»Let us make an agreement that there will be intermarriage between our people and yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.10'>»Then you may stay here in our country with us. You may live anywhere you wish. You may trade freely and own property.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.11'>Shechem added: »Let me have your favor and I will give you whatever you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.12'>»Ask anything as the bride price, no matter how expensive. I will do anything. Just let me marry Dinah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.13'>Jacobs sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what happened to their sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.14'>So they tricked them by saying: »You are not circumcised! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.15'>»But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe get circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.16'>»Then we will give our daughters to you. And we will take your daughters for us. We will live with you as one people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.17'>»But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.18'>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamors son Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.19'>The young man did not delay to do what was required. This was because he had delight in Jacobs daughter. He was the most honored of all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.20'>Hamor and his son Shechem went to their city gate to speak to the men of their city. They said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.21'>»These people are friendly toward us. So let them live in our land and move about freely in the area. Look, there is plenty of room in this land for them. We can marry their daughters and let them marry ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.22'>»These people will consent to live with us and become one nation on one condition: Every male must be circumcised, as they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.23'>»Then all their livestock and everything else they own will be ours. So let us agree that they can live among us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.24'>All the citizens of the city agreed with what Hamor and Shechem proposed. Then all the males were circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.25'>Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi, two of Dinahs brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.26'>They also killed Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.27'>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain. They plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.28'>They took their flocks and their herds, their asses and whatever was in the city and in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.29'>They captured their wives and all their little ones. They took all the wealth that was in their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.30'>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: »You have brought trouble on me by making me loathsome to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few. If they gather themselves against me and attack my household I will be destroyed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.31'>They responded: »Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.35'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.1'>God said to Jacob: »Go to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar to God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.2'>Jacob said to his family and those who were with him: »Get rid of the foreign gods that you have. Wash yourselves until you are ritually clean. Change your clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.3'>»After that let us go to Bethel. I will make an altar there to God, who answered me when I was troubled and who has been with me wherever I have gone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.4'>So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings. He buried them under the oak big tree near Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.5'>Jacob and his family traveled through Canaan. God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.6'>Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.7'>Jacob built an altar there and called it God of Bethel. That was the place where God appeared to him when he was running from Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.8'>Deborah died. She was the servant who cared for Rebekah from childhood. She was buried near Bethel, under the holy tree. They named it Allon-bacuth weeping tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.9'>God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram. He blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.10'>God said to him: »Your name is Jacob. You shall no longer be called Jacob. Israel shall be your name.« Thus He called him Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.11'>God also said: »I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and an assembly of nations will come from you. Kings shall come forth from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.12'>»The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. I will give the land to your descendants after you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.13'>Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.14'>So Jacob set up a memorial, a stone marker, to mark the place where God had spoken with him. He poured a wine offering and olive oil on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.15'>Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel House of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.16'>After that they moved from Bethel. When there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. She had severe labor pains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.17'>When one of her pains hit, the midwife said: »Do not be afraid. You have another son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.18'>Rachel was dying! With her last breath she named her son Ben-oni Son of My Sorrow, but his father named him Benjamin Son of My Right Hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.19'>Rachel died and was buried on the way to Bethlehem Ephrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.20'>Jacob set up a stone as a marker for her grave. The same marker is at Rachels grave today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.21'>Israel moved on again. He pitched his tent by the tower of Eder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.22'>While Israel lived in that region, Reuben went to bed with his fathers concubine Bilhah. Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.23'>The sons of Leah were Jacobs firstborn Reuben, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.24'>The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.25'>The sons of Rachels slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.26'>The sons of Leahs slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were Jacobs sons, who were born in Paddan-aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.27'>Jacob came home to his father Isaac, to Mamres city, Kiriath-arba Hebron. Abraham and Isaac had lived there for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.28'>Isaac was one hundred and eighty years old.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.36.6'>Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.7'>For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock.</verse>

        <title>JOSEPHS COAT OF MANY COLORS</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.1'>Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.2'>This is the story of Jacob and his descendants. Joseph was a seventeen-year-old young man. He took care of the flocks with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his fathers wives. Joseph told his father about the bad things his brothers were doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.3'>Jacob Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because Joseph had been born in Israels old age. So he made Joseph a special multicolored robe with long sleeves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.4'>Josephs brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them. They hated Joseph and could not speak to him in a friendly way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.5'>One time Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about it and they hated him even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.6'>He said: »Please listen to the dream I had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.7'>»We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat. My sheaf got up and stood up straight. Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.8'>»Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us?« his brothers asked. So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.9'>Joseph had another dream and told his brothers: »I had another dream, in which I saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.10'>He also told the dream to his father. His father scolded him. »What kind of a dream is that? Do you think that your mother, your brothers, and I are going to come and bow down to you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.11'>Josephs brothers were jealous of him. His father kept thinking about the whole matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.12'>His brothers went to Shechem to take care of their fathers flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.13'>His father Jacob said to him: »I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.« »Yes, I will go,« Joseph answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.14'>His father said: »Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.« So he sent him from Hebron Valley. Joseph was near Shechem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.15'>and wandering through the fields, when a man asked: »What are you looking for?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.16'>Joseph answered: »I am looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.17'>»They are not here anymore,« the man replied. »I heard them say they were going to Dothan.« Joseph soon found his brothers in Dothan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.18'>Before he arrived, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.19'>They said to one another: »Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.20'>»Let us kill him and throw him into a water pit. We can say that some wild animal ate him. Then we will see what happens to those dreams.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.21'>Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. »Let us not kill him,« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.22'>»Do not murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert.« Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.23'>When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.24'>They put him into a water pit. It had no water in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.25'>As they sat down to eat, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying the materials for cosmetics, medicine, and embalming. They were on their way to take them to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.26'>Judah asked his brothers: »What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.27'>»Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let us not hurt him, because he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.« His brothers agreed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.28'>Some of the Midianite traders approached. The brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites. They took him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.29'>Reuben came back to the pit and found that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.30'>He returned to his brothers and said: »The boy is not there! What am I going to do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.31'>Then they killed a goat and dipped Josephs robe in its blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.32'>They took the robe to their father and said: »We found this. Does it belong to your son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.33'>He recognized it and said: »Yes, it is his! Some wild animal has killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.34'>Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. He mourned for his son a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.35'>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him. However, he refused to be comforted. He said: »I will go down to the grave still mourning for my son.« So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph.</verse>
        <title>JOSEPH SOLD TO POTIPHAR</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.36'>Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of the kings officers, who was the captain of the palace guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.38'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.1'>At that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah, who was from the town of Adullam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.2'>Judah met a young Canaanite woman there whose father was named Shua. He married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.3'>Shua bore him a son, whom he named Er.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.4'>She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son and named him Onan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.5'>She had another son and named him Shelah. Judah was at Achzib when the boy was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.6'>For his first son Er, Judah got a wife whose name was Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.7'>Er was an evil man. It displeased Jehovah. So Jehovah killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.8'>Then Judah said to Ers brother Onan: »Go sleep with your brothers widow. Fulfill your obligation to her as her husbands brother. That way your brother may have descendants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.9'>Onan knew that the children would not belong to him. So when he had intercourse with his brothers widow, he let the semen spill on the ground, assuring that there would be no children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.10'>What he did displeased Jehovah. So Jehovah killed him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.11'>Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar: »Return to your fathers house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up.« He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed, as his brothers had been. So Tamar went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.12'>After some time Judahs wife died. When he finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah of Adullam went to Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.13'>Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.14'>She realized that Shelah was now a grown man. She had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widows clothes and to cover her face with a veil. Then she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.15'>Judah came along. He did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.16'>and asked her to sleep with him. She asked: »What will you give me if I do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.17'>He answered: »One of my young goats.« Then she asked: »What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.18'>»What do you want?« he asked. »The ring on that cord around your neck,« she replied. »I also want the special walking stick you have with you.« So he gave them to her. They slept together and she became pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.19'>After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widows clothes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.20'>Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the womans hand. But he did not find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.21'>He asked the men: »Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?« They said: »There has been no temple prostitute here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.22'>So he went back to Judah and said: »I did not find her. Besides, the men who lived there said there has not been any temple prostitute here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.23'>Then Judah said: »Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you did not find her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.24'>Three months later Judah was told: »Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.« Judah said: »Bring her out and have her burned to death!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.25'>As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. »I am pregnant by the man who owns these,« she said. She added: »See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.26'>Judah recognized them and said: »She is more righteous than I, since I would not give her to my son Shelah.« He did not sleep with her again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.27'>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.28'>As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. The midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said: »This one came out first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.29'>When he drew back his hand, his brother came out. She said: »So this is how you have broken out!« He was named Perez.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.30'>Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.39'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.1'>Joseph had been taken to Egypt. Potiphar, one of Pharaohs Egyptian officials and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.2'>Jehovah was with Joseph. Joseph became a successful man. He worked in the house of his Egyptian master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.3'>Josephs master saw that Jehovah was with him. Jehovah made him succeed in everything he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.4'>Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant. He put him in charge of his house and everything he owned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.5'>Jehovah blessed the Egyptians household and everything he had in his house and in his fields because of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.6'>Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Joseph was well built and good-looking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.7'>Soon his masters wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.8'>He refused, and said to her: »My master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house, because I am here. He has put me in charge of everything he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.9'>»No one in this house is greater than I. He has kept nothing back from me except you. You are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.10'>She kept asking Joseph day after day. He refused to go to bed with her or be with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.11'>One day he went into the house to do his work. None of the household servants were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.12'>She grabbed him by his coat and said: »Come to bed with me!« But he ran outside and left his coat in her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.13'>When she realized that he had gone but had left his coat behind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.14'>she called her household servants and said to them: »Look! My husband brought this Hebrew here to fool around with us. He came in and tried to go to bed with me. I screamed as loud as I could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.15'>»When he heard me scream, he ran out of the house, leaving his coat with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.16'>Potiphars wife kept Josephs coat until her husband came home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.17'>She said: »That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.18'>»When I screamed for help, he left his coat and ran out of the house.«</verse>
        <title>JOSEPH SENT TO PRISON</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.19'>Potiphar became very angry</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.20'>and threw Joseph in the same prison where the kings prisoners were kept. While Joseph was in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.21'>Jehovah helped him and was good to him. He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.22'>he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.23'>The jailer did not worry about anything, because Jehovah was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.40'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.1'>The kings chief cupbearer and his chief baker made the king angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.2'>Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.3'>So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard. It was the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.4'>The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph. He took care of them. After they had been confined for some time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.5'>both prisoners, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, had dreams one night. Each man had a dream with its own special meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.6'>Joseph saw that they were upset when he came to them in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.7'>He asked these officials of Pharaoh who were with him in his masters prison: »Why do you look so unhappy today?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.8'>»We both had dreams,« they answered him, »but there is no one to tell us what they mean.« »Is it not God who can tell what dreams mean?« Joseph asked them. »Tell me all about them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.9'>So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said: »In my dream a grapevine with three branches appeared in front of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.10'>»Soon after it sprouted it blossomed. Then its clusters ripened into grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.11'>»Pharaohs cup was in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into it. I put the cup in Pharaohs hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.12'>»This is what it means,« Joseph said to him. »The three branches are three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.13'>»In the next three days Pharaoh will release you and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaohs cup in his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.14'>»Remember me when things go well for you. Please do me a favor. Mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.15'>»I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews. And here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.16'>When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph: »I also saw in my dream three baskets of white bread on my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.17'>»The top basket contained all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh. The birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.18'>Joseph answered: »This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.19'>»In three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you. He will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.20'>It happened on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday that he made a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.21'>He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.22'>He did indeed hang the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.23'>Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph. In fact he forgot him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.41'>
        <title>JOSEPH TELLS MEANING OF DREAMS</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.1'>Two years later Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamed he was standing by the Nile River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.2'>Suddenly, seven nice-looking well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.3'>Seven other cows came up from the river behind them. These cows were sickly and skinny. They stood behind the first seven cows on the riverbank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.4'>The cows that were sickly and skinny ate the seven nice-looking well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.5'>He fell asleep again and had another dream. Seven heads of grain, full and ripe, were growing on one stalk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.6'>Then seven other heads of grain sprouted thin and scorched by the desert wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.7'>The thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.8'>The king was upset the next morning. So he called his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.9'>The kings chief cupbearer said: »Now I remember what I was supposed to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.10'>»When you were angry with your chief cook and me, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.11'>»One night we both had dreams. Each dream had a different meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.12'>»A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.13'>»Everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.14'>So the king sent for Joseph. He was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.15'>The king said: »I had a dream. No one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.16'>Joseph then answered Pharaoh: »I cannot do it myself, but God can give the meaning of your dreams.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.17'>The king told Joseph: »I dreamed as I stood on the bank of the Nile River,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.18'>»I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river. They began feeding on the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.19'>»Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.20'>»The skinny cows ate the fat ones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'>»Even though they had eaten the fat cows, no one could tell they had eaten them. They looked just as sick as before. Then I woke up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.22'>»In my second dream I saw seven good, full heads of grain growing on a single stalk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.23'>»Seven other heads of grain, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.24'>»The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.25'>Joseph said to Pharaoh: »Pharaoh had the same dream twice. God has told Pharaoh what he is going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.26'>»The seven good cows are seven years. The seven good heads of grain are seven years. It is all the same dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.27'>»The seven thin, sickly cows that came up behind them are seven years. The seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are also seven years. Seven years of famine are coming!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.28'>»It is just as I said to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.29'>»Seven years are coming when there will be plenty of food in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.30'>»Seven years of famine will follow. Then people will forget that there was plenty of food in Egypt. The famine will ruin the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.31'>»People will not remember that there was once plenty of food in the land, because the coming famine will be so severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>»The reason Pharaoh has had a recurring dream is because the matter has been definitely decided by God. He will do it very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>»Pharaoh should look for a wise and intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.34'>»Make arrangements to appoint supervisors over the land. Take a fifth of Egypts harvest during the seven good years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.35'>»Have them collect all the food during these good years. Store up grain under Pharaohs control, to be kept for food in the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'>»This food will be a reserve supply for our country during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt. Then the land will not be ruined by the famine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'>The king and his officials approved this plan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.38'>and he said to them: »We will never find a better man than Joseph. He is a man who has Gods Spirit in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.39'>The king said to Joseph: »God has shown you all this. Therefore it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.40'>»I will put you in charge of my country. All my people will obey your orders. Your authority will be second only to mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.41'>»I now appoint you governor over all Egypt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.42'>Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Josephs hand. He clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.43'>He had him ride in his second chariot. They proclaimed before him: »Bow the knee!« Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.44'>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph: »Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.45'>Pharaoh named Joseph, Zaphenath-paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.46'>Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.47'>During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.48'>He gathered all the food of these seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities. He placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.49'>Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea. He finally stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.50'>Before the year of famine came, there were born to Joseph two sons, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.51'>Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh, because God helped him forget all his troubles and all about his fathers family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.52'>He named the second son Ephraim, because God made him fruitful in the land where he had suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.53'>The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.54'>The seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every other country, but there was food throughout Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.55'>When the Egyptians became hungry, they cried out to the king for food. So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.56'>The famine grew worse and spread over the entire country. Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.57'>People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.42'>
        <title>JOSEPH REUNITED WITH FAMILY</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.1'>When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons: »Why are you doing nothing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.2'>He said: »I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.3'>Then ten of Josephs brothers went to Egypt to buy grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.4'>Jacob would not send Josephs brother Benjamin with the other brothers. He was afraid that something would happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.5'>Israels sons left with the others who were going to buy grain. This is because there was also famine in Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.6'>As governor of the country, Joseph was selling grain to everyone. So when Josephs brothers arrived, they bowed in front of him with their faces touching the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.7'>Joseph recognized his brothers the moment he saw them. Even so, he acted as if he did not know them and spoke harshly to them: »Where did you come from?« They answered: »From Canaan, to buy food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.8'>Even though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.9'>He remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said: »You are spies! You have come to find out where our country is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.10'>»No!« they answered. »We have come as your slaves, to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.11'>»We are all brothers. We are not spies. We are honest men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.12'>Joseph said to them: »No! You have come to find out where our country is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.13'>They said: »Sir, we were twelve brothers in all, sons of the same man in the land of Canaan. One brother is dead, and the youngest is now with our father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.14'>»It is just as I said,« Joseph answered. »You are spies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.15'>»This is how you will be tested: I swear by the name of the king that you will never leave unless your youngest brother comes here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.16'>»One of you must go and get him. The rest of you will be kept under guard until the truth of what you say can be tested. Otherwise, as sure as the king lives, you are spies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.17'>He put all of them together in prison for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.18'>On the third day, Joseph said: »Do this and live, for I too respect God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.19'>»If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in prison. Concerning the rest of you, carry grain for the famine of your households,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.20'>»and bring your youngest brother to me. We will verify your words and you will not die.« They complied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.21'>They said to one another: »Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw his distress when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.22'>Reuben said: »Did I not tell you? Did I say, Do not sin against the boy? You would not listen! Now comes the reckoning for his blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.23'>They did not know that Joseph understood. There was an interpreter between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.24'>He turned away from them and wept. When he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.25'>Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every mans money in his sack. They were to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.26'>They loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.27'>They stopped for the night. One of them opened his sack to feed his donkey and his money was right inside his sack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.28'>He said to his brothers: »My money has been put back! It is right here in my sack!« They wanted to die. They trembled and turned to each other and asked: »What has God done to us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.29'>They came to their father Jacob in Canaan. Then they told him all that had happened to them. They said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.30'>»The governor of that land spoke harshly to us and treated us like spies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.31'>We told him: »We are honest men, not spies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.32'>»We were twelve brothers, sons of the same father. One is no longer with us. The youngest brother stayed with our father in Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.33'>»The governor of that land said to us, This is how I will know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me. Take food for your starving families and go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.34'>»But bring me your youngest brother. Then I will know that you are not spies but honest men. I will give your brother back to you, and you will be able to move about freely in this country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.35'>As they were emptying their sacks, each man found his bag of money in his sack. When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.36'>Their father Jacob said to them: »You are going to make me lose all my children! Joseph is no longer with us. Simeon is no longer with us. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.37'>So Reuben said to his father: »You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Let me take care of him. I will bring him back to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.38'>Jacob replied: »My son will not go with you. His brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If any harm comes to him on the trip you are taking, the grief would drive this gray-haired old man to his grave!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.43'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.1'>The famine was extremely bad in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.2'>When they finished eating the grain they brought from Egypt, Israel said to his sons: »Go back and buy us a little more food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.3'>Judah said to him: »The man gave us strict warning! He said: You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.4'>»If you let our brother go with us, we will go and buy food for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.5'>»If you will not let him go, we will not go. The man said to us: You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.6'>Israel asked: »Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.7'>They answered: »The man kept asking about our family and us. He asked, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? We simply answered his questions. How could we possibly know he would say, Bring your brother here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.8'>Then Judah said to his father Israel: »Send the boy along with me. Let us get going so that we will not starve to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.9'>»I guarantee that he will come back. You can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here in front of you, you can blame me the rest of my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.10'>»If we had not waited so long, we could have made this trip twice by now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.11'>Their father Israel said: »If that is the way it has to be, then take the man a gift. Put some of the best products of the land in your bags. Take a little balm, a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.12'>»Take twice as much money with you, because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.13'>»Take your brother and return at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.14'>»May God Almighty cause the man to have pity on you, so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you. As for me, if I must lose my children, I must lose them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.15'>So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money, and set out for Egypt with Benjamin. There they presented themselves to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.16'>He saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house: »Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and cook it, so they can eat with me at noon.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.17'>The servant did as he was told. He took the brothers to Josephs house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.18'>On the way they were worried and started talking: »We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time. He will arrest us and take our donkeys. He will make us his slaves!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.19'>When they arrived at Josephs house, they said to the servant in charge:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.20'>»We came to Egypt once before to buy grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.21'>»When we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.22'>»We brought enough money to buy more grain. We do not know who put the money in our sacks.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.23'>»It is all right,« the servant replied. »Do not worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because your money came first to me.« Then he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.24'>The servant took them into Josephs house. He gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.25'>The brothers prepared their gifts so they could give them to Joseph at noon. For they had heard they were going to eat there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.26'>Joseph came home and they gave him the gifts they had brought. They bowed down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.27'>Joseph asked how they were. He said: »What about your elderly father? Is he still alive?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.28'>They answered: »Your servant our father is still alive and well.« Again they bowed down to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.29'>Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin. He said: »This must be the youngest brother you told me about. God bless you, my son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.30'>Right away he rushed off to his room and cried because of his love for Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.31'>After washing his face and returning, he was able to control himself. He said: »Serve the meal!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.32'>Joseph was served at a table by himself. His brothers were served at another. The Egyptians sat at yet another table. This is because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.33'>To the surprise of Josephs brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.34'>They were served food from Josephs table. And Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Josephs brothers drank with him and had a good time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.44'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.1'>Later, Joseph told the servant in charge of his house: »Fill the mens grain sacks with as much as they can hold and put their money in the sacks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.2'>»Also put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother.« The servant did as he was told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.3'>When it was light the men took their donkeys and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.4'>They just left the city and were not far off, when Joseph said to the man in charge of his house: »Follow the men and when you overtake them, say to them: Why have you repaid evil for good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.5'>»Is this the cup that my master drinks from and that he uses for telling the future? What you have done is evil!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.6'>When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.7'>They answered him: »What do you mean, Sir, by talking like this? We swear that we have done no such thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.8'>»You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks. Why should we steal silver or gold from your masters house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.9'>»If you find that one of us has the cup, then kill him. The rest of us will become your slaves.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.10'>»Good!« the man replied. »I would do what you have said. But only the one who has the cup will become my slave. The rest of you can go free.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.11'>Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.12'>Josephs servant started searching the sacks. They began with the one that belonged to the oldest brother. When he came to Benjamins sack, he found the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.13'>This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow. Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.14'>When Judah and his brothers got there, Joseph was still at home. So they bowed down to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.15'>He asked them: »What have you done? Did you not know I could find out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.16'>»Sir, what can we say?« Judah replied. »How can we prove we are innocent? God has shown that we are guilty. And now all of us are your slaves, especially the one who had the cup.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.17'>He said: »It is far from me that I should do this. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant. As for you, you go in peace to your father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.18'>Judah went up to Joseph and said: »Please, Sir, let me speak openly with you. Do not be angry with me, although you are equal to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.19'>»Sir, you asked us, Do you have a father or a brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.20'>»We answered, We have a father who is old and a younger brother born to him when he was already old. The boys brother is dead. He is the only one of his mothers sons left, and his father loves him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.21'>Then you said to us, Bring him here to me so that I can see him myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.22'>»We replied, The boy cannot leave his father. If the boy leaves him, his father will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.23'>»Then you said you will not be admitted to my presence again unless your youngest brother comes with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.24'>»We went back and told our father what you said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.25'>»He told us to return and buy a little food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.49.25'>»because of the God of your father who helps you, because of the Almighty who blesses you from the heavens above, blessings from the deep springs below the ground, blessings from breasts and womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.26'>»The blessings of your father are greater than the blessings of the oldest mountains and the riches of the ancient hills. May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince among his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.27'>»Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning and evening he destroys his enemies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.28'>These are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is how Jacob blessed each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.29'>Jacob told his sons: »Soon I will die. I want you to bury me in Machpelah Cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.30'>»Abraham bought the cave from Ephron the Hittite to use as a burial place. It is near the field of Machpelah. It is also near the town of Mamre in Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.31'>»Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there. Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there. I also buried Leah there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.32'>»The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.33'>Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons. He pulled his feet into his bed. He took his last breath and joined his ancestors in death.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.50'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.1'>Joseph threw himself on his father. He cried over him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.2'>Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his fathers body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.3'>It took forty days, which is the normal time for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.4'>When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the kings officials: »Please take this message to the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.5'>»When my father was about to die, he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb that he had prepared in the land of Canaan. Please, let me go and bury my father. Then I will come back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.6'>The king replied: »By all means go and bury your father, as you promised you would.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.7'>So Joseph went to bury his father. All the kings officials, the senior men of his court, and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.8'>His family, including his brothers, and the rest of his fathers family all went with him. Only their small children and their sheep, goats, and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.9'>Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him. It was a very large group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.10'>They mourned loudly for a long time at the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan. Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.11'>The citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad. They said: »What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding!« That is why the place was named Abel-mizraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.12'>Jacobs sons did as he had commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.13'>They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre. He was buried in the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.14'>After the funeral, Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else returned to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.15'>After Jacob died, Josephs brothers said to each other: »What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.16'>Thus they sent word to Joseph, saying: »Your father gave us orders before his death. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.17'>»You are to say to Joseph: »Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you. If it is your pleasure, forgive the sin of the servants of your fathers God.« « Upon hearing these words Joseph was overcome with weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.18'>Then his brothers also came and immediately bowed down in front of him. »We are your slaves!« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.19'>Joseph replied to them: »Do not be afraid! I cannot take Gods place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.20'>»Even though you planned evil against me, God planned good to come out of it. This was to keep many people alive, as he is doing now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.21'>»You have nothing to fear. I will take care of you and your children.« So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.22'>Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his fathers family. He was a hundred and ten years old when he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.23'>Joseph lived long enough to see Ephraims children and grandchildren. He also lived to see the children of Manassehs son Machir. He welcomed them into his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.24'>Before Joseph died, he told his brothers: »I will not live much longer. God will take care of you. He will lead you out of Egypt to the land he promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.25'>»Promise me that you will take my body with you when God leads you to that land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.26'>Joseph died in Egypt at the age of one hundred and ten. His body was embalmed and put in a coffin.</verse>
