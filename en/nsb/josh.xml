        <title>(Writer: Joshua) (1450 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Moses the servant of Jehovah died. After his death Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>»Moses my servant is dead. Arise and cross over the Jordan River. Take the people into the land given to them, even to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>»I give you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon just as I promised Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>»From the wilderness and nearby Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun to the west, shall be your coast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>»No man will be able to resist you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>»Be strong and courageous for you will help this people inherit the land. This is the land I swore to give to their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>»Be strong and very courageous, that you may be careful to do according to all the Law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>»This Book of the Law will not depart out of your mouth. You must meditate intensely studythink deeply on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>»Have I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Joshua commanded the officers of the people. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>»Pass through the middle of the camp and command the people, say: Prepare your provisions. In three days you will pass over this Jordan. You will go in to possess the land that Jehovah your God gave you to possess.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>»Remember the word Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you: Jehovah your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>»Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>»Your brothers will possess the land Jehovah gave them until Jehovah gives your brothers rest. Then you will return to the land you possess and enjoy it. This is the land Jehovahs servant Moses gave you on this side of Jordan toward the sunrise to the east.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>They answered Joshua: »All that you command us we will do. Wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>»Just as we listened to Moses in all things, we will listen to you in all things. May Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>»Whoever rebels against your commandment, and does not listen to your words in all that you command him must be put to death. Be strong and of a good courage.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly. He said: »Go view the land of Jericho.« They went to a prostitute named Rahab, and stayed at her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>The king of Jericho was told: »Men of the children of Israel came here tonight to search out the country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>The king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying: »Bring the men that came to you and stayed at your house. They came to spy on all the country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>The woman took the two men, and hid them. She said: »Men came to me but I did not know where they came from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>When it was dark and they shut the gate the men went out. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly and you will overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>She hid them on the rooftop of the house. She covered them with stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>The men pursued them by the road to Jordan to the fords. As soon the pursuers went out they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>Before they laid down to sleep she came up to them on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>She said to the men: »I know Jehovah has given you the land and the terror of you has fallen on us. All the inhabitants of the land are afraid of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>»We heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red sea for you when you came out of Egypt. And what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>»As soon as we heard these things we became discouraged. No man had courage because of you. Jehovah your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>»I pray that you will swear to me by Jehovah, since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness to my fathers house, and give me a true tokensignpledge of truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>»That you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers and sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>The men answered her: »Our life for yours, if you do not reveal our business. It will be, when Jehovah has given us the land. We will deal kindly and truly with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall. She lived on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>She said: »Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return and afterward go your way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>The men said to her: »We will be free from this oath you made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>»When we come into the land, tie this scarlet cord in the window from which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers and sisters and your fathers entire household into your home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>»Whoever goes out of your house into the street will be responsible for his own life. We will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is laid on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>»If you tell what we are doing we will be released from the oath you made us swear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>She said: »Let it be according to your words.« They departed and she tied the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>They went to the mountain and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers looked for them everywhere but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men descended from the mountain. They returned to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all the things that happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>They said to Joshua: »Truly Jehovah has delivered into our hands all of the land. The inhabitants of the country are afraid of us.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>Joshua rose early in the morning. They left Shittim for Jordan. He and all the children of Israel lodged there before they crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>After three days the officers went through the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>They commanded the people, saying: »When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, you should leave here and follow it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>»You should keep a space of a thousand yards between you and the ark. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way before.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>Joshua said to the people: »Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow Jehovah will do amazing things among you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>Joshua spoke to the priests: »Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and pass over before the people.« So they took the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>Jehovah said to Joshua: »This day will I begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel. Now they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>»You will command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant, saying: When you come to the shore of the Jordan River you will stand still in the Jordan.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>Joshua said to the children of Israel: »Come here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>Joshua said: »By this you shall know the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>»The Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah the God of all the earth passed over before you into Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>»Take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>»As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, set foot in the Jordan the waters of Jordan shall be cut off and they shall stand in a heap.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>When the people set out from their camp to cross the Jordan, and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>As they carried the ark into the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped into the water, for Jordan is at food stage at the time of harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>The waters stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city Adam that is beside Zaretan. The waters that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off. The people passed over the Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River. All the Israelites passed over the Jordan River on dry ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>All the people finished crossing the Jordan River. Then Jehovah spoke to Joshua:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take twelve men out of the people. Take a man out of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>Command them by saying: »Take twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests feet stood firm. Carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you stay tonight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared from the children of Israel, a man from every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>Joshua said to them: »Pass over before the Ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan River. Let every man take a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>»This may be a sign among you when your children ask their fathers what is the meaning of these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>»You will answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah. When it passed over Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be for a memorial to the children of Israel for as long as they live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan. This was just as Jehovah spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They carried them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River, in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant stood, and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>The priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan River. They stood there until every thing that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people was carried out, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. During this time the people hurried to the other side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>All the people crossed over. Then the priests, in the presence of the people, carried the Ark of Jehovah across.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand, prepared for war, passed over before Jehovah to do battle in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day Jehovah exulted Joshua in the sight of all Israel. They feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>»Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Testimony that they come up from the Jordan.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying: »Come up from the Jordan.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>When the priests that carried the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah were up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up onto the dry land that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>The people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>Joshua set up the twelve stones they took out of the Jordan River, in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>He spoke to the children of Israel: »When your children will ask their fathers in time to come, what these stones mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>»Then you will let your children know, saying: Israel came over this Jordan River on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>»For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you, until you all crossed over. As Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>»That all the people of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah is mighty: that you might reverence Jehovah your God forever.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>When all the kings of the Amorites, on the west side of the Jordan River and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we passed over, their hearts grew faint with fear. They were discouraged because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>Jehovah said to Joshua: »Make sharp knives, and circumcise the men of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>Joshua made sharp knives, and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>This is why Joshua circumcised: All the men who came out of Egypt including all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Now all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt were not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>The children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah. Jehovah swore that he would not show them the land, which he swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>Joshua circumcised their children, whom he raised up in their place. They had not circumcised them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>When they were done circumcising all the people they stayed in the camp till they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>Jehovah said to Joshua: »This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.« So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>After the Passover they ate the old corn of the land, unleavened cakes, and parched corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>The manna ceased the morning after they ate the old corn of the land. The children of Israel had no more manna. But they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, there stood a man in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said: »Are you on our side or our adversaries?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>He said: »No, but as captain of the camp of Jehovah I now come.« And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down and said: »What does my lord say to his servant?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>The captain commander of Jehovahs host army said to Joshua: »Take your shoes from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.« And at once Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <title>BATTLE OF JERICHO</title>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was tightly shut up because the people were afraid of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>Jehovah said to Joshua: »See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king there, and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>»March around the city with all your armed men. Go around the city once per day for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>»Seven priests will carry before you seven trumpets of rams horns along with the Ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times. The priests shall blow the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>»When you hear a long blast with the rams horn, all the people will shout with a great shout. The wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up, every man straight in to the city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them: »Take up the Ark of the Covenant. Seven priests should carry seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>He said to the people: »Pass on, and circle the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the Ark of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>As soon as Joshua spoke to the people the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams horns passed before Jehovah. They blew the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>The armed men marched ahead of the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the Ark. All the time the priests kept blowing the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>Joshua commanded the people, saying: »You will not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither will any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout. Then you will shout.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the Ark of Jehovah went around the city one time. They came to the camp, and stayed in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>Joshua rose early in the morning. The priests picked up the Ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>Seven priests carrying seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew with the trumpets. The armed men went before them. The rear guard followed the Ark of Jehovah. The priests were blowing the trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they went around the city once, and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>They rose early at dawn on the seventh day. They circled the city in the same manner. Only on that day they went around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>On the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people: »Shout for Jehovah has given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>»The city and everything in it will be destroyed. It belongs to Jehovah. Only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in her house will live. Because she hid the messengers we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>»You people must stay away from anything devoted to destruction. You should not take things from the city. You will cause trouble for the camp of Israel is you take of the accursed things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>»All the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to Jehovah. They must come into the treasury of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, the wall fell down flat. The people went into the city, every man straight ahead. They captured the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the country: »Go into the harlots house, and bring the woman out as you swore to her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, mother, and her brothers and all that she had. They brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>They burned the city and all its contents. They put the silver, gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her fathers household, and all that she had. She dwells in Israel even to this day because she hid the messengers Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>Joshua pronounced an oath at that time, saying: »Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that rises up and builds this city Jericho. He will lay the foundation at the cost of his firstborn. He will set up the gates at the cost of his youngest son.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>The children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel. He spoke to them: »Go up and spy on the country.« And the men went up and spied on Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>They returned to Joshua, and said: »Do not send all the people. Send about two or three thousand men to Ai to go up and capture Ai. Do not bother all the people for there are only a few there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So about three thousand men left the people. The men of Ai routed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them: for they chased them going down from before the gate to Shebarim. The heart of the people melted, and became as water. The Israelites lost their courage and were afraid</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua ripped his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of Jehovah until evening. He threw dust on his head. The elders of Israel did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>Joshua said: »Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, why did you bring this people across the Jordan. Was it to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would to God we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>»O Jehovah, what shall I say, when Israel turned their backs before its enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>»For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it, and will surround us and cut our name off from the earth. What will you do for your great name?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>Jehovah said to Joshua: »You get up! Why are you on your face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>»Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things and put them in their own possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>»Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies. They ran from their enemies, because they were accursed. I will not be with you any more until you destroy the devoted things you have among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>»Get up and sanctify the people. Say: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: »There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel: You cannot stand before you enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>Achan answered Joshua: »Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel. This I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>»When I saw among the spoils a quality Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them. I hid them in the earth in the middle of my tent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers to the tent and found it and the silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>They took them out of the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>Joshua said: »Why have you troubled us? Jehovah will trouble you this day.« All Israel stoned them with stones. After they stoned them they burned them with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>They raised over them a great heap of stones that is there to this day. So Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. The name of that place was called, the Valley of Achor, to this day.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.22'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.1'>Joshua called together the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.2'>He said: »You have done everything Jehovahs servant Moses ordered you to do. You have obeyed all my commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.3'>»You have never deserted the other Israelites. You have been careful to obey the commandments of Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.4'>»Jehovah your God has given the other Israelites peace as he promised. So go back home to the land you claimed for your own, the land on the east side of the Jordan, that Moses, Jehovahs servant, gave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.5'>»Be sure you obey the Law that Moses commanded you. Love Jehovah your God. Do his will. Obey his commandments and be faithful to him. Serve him with all your heart and with all your being Nephesh: living being.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.6'>Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.7'>To the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but he gave the other half to Joshua among their brothers on this side Jordan westward. Joshua sent them a way to their tents and he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.8'>He said: »Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.9'>So the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh went back home. They left the rest of the people of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and started out for their own land, the land of Gilead, which they had taken as Jehovah commanded them through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.10'>The children of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manassah built a large altar by the borders of Jordan in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.11'>The children of Israel heard that the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar in the land of Canaan on the side belonging to the sons of Israel, at the Jordan when they passed by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.12'>When the people of Israel heard this, the whole community came together at Shiloh to go to war against the eastern tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.13'>Then the people of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.14'>Ten leading men went with Phinehas, one from each of the western tribes and each one the head of a family among the clans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.15'>They came to the land of Gilead, to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.16'>Speaking for the whole assembly of Jehovahs people they said: »Why have you done this evil thing against the God of Israel? You have rebelled against Jehovah by building this altar for yourselves! You are no longer following him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.17'>»Do you remember our sin at Peor, when Jehovah punished his own people with an epidemic? We are still suffering because of that. Was that not enough sin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.18'>»Are you going to refuse to follow him now? If you rebel against Jehovah now, he will be angry with everyone in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.19'>»If your land is not fit to worship in, come over into Jehovahs land, where his Tabernacle is. Claim some land among us. But do not rebel against Jehovah or make rebels out of us by building an altar in addition to the altar of Jehovah our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.20'>»Remember how Achan son of Zerah would not obey the command about the things condemned to destruction. The whole assembly of Israel was punished for that. Achan was not the only one who died because of his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.21'>»The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered the heads of the families of the western tribes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.22'>»The Mighty, Divine One is God of Gods! He is Jehovah! The Mighty, Divine One is God of Gods! He is Jehovah! He knows why we did this, and we want you to know too! If we rebelled and did not keep faith with Jehovah, do not allow us to live any longer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.23'>»If we disobeyed Jehovah and built our own altar to burn sacrifices on or to use for grain offerings or fellowship offerings, let Jehovah himself punish us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.24'>»No! We did it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants would say to ours: What do you have to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.25'>»He made the Jordan a boundary between the people of Reuben and Gad and us. You have nothing to do with Jehovah. Then your descendants might make our descendants stop worshiping Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.26'>»We did not built an altar to burn sacrifices or make offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.27'>but instead, as a sign for our people and yours, and for the generations after us, that we do indeed worship Jehovah. We do this before his sacred Tabernacle with our offerings to be burned and with sacrifices and fellowship offerings. This was to keep your descendants from saying that ours have nothing to do with Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.28'>»We thought that if this should ever happen, our descendants could say: You see our ancestors made an altar just like Jehovahs altar. It was not for burning offerings or for sacrifice, but as a sign for our people and yours.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.29'>We would certainly not rebel against Jehovah or stop following him now by building an altar to burn offerings on or for grain offerings or sacrifices. We would not build any other altar than the altar of Jehovah our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle of his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.30'>Phinehas the priest and the ten leading men of the community with him, the heads of families of the western tribes, heard what the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh had to say, and they were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.31'>Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them: »We know that Jehovah is with us. You have not rebelled against him. So you have saved the people of Israel from Jehovahs punishment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.32'>Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan, to the people of Israel, and reported to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.33'>The Israelites were satisfied and praised God. They no longer talked about going to war to devastate the land where the people of Reuben and Gad had settled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.34'>The people of Reuben and Gad said: »This altar is a witness to all of us that Jehovah is God. Therefore they named it witness.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.23'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.1'>Later Jehovah gave Israel security from their enemies all around. By that time Joshua was very old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.2'>He called all Israel, the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people, and said: »I am very old now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.3'>»You have seen everything Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you. Jehovah your God fights for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.4'>»I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left, as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered, from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.5'>»Jehovah your God will make them retreat from you. He will drive them away as you advance. You will possess their land, as Jehovah your God promised you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.6'>»Be careful to obey and do everything that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses. Do not neglect any of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.7'>»You will not associate with these peoples left among you or speak the names of their gods or use those names in taking vows or worship those gods or bow down to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.8'>»Remain faithful to Jehovah, as you have been until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.9'>»Jehovah has driven great and powerful nations from before you. No one has ever been able to stand against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.10'>»One of you can make a thousand men run away, because Jehovah your God is fighting for you, as he promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.11'>»Take heed of yourselves to love Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.12'>»If you are disloyal and join with the nations that are still left among you and intermarry with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.13'>»Jehovah your God will no longer drive these nations out as you advance. Rather, they will be as dangerous for you as a trap or a pit and as painful as a whip on your back or thorns in your eyes. This will last until none of you are left in this good land that Jehovah your God gave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.14'>»It is time for me to die. Every one of you knows in his heart and very being that Jehovah your God has given you all the good things he promised. Every promise he made has been kept; not one has failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.15'>»Just as he kept every promise that he made to you, so he will carry out every threat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.16'>»If you do not obey the covenant Jehovah your God commanded you to obey and if you serve and worship other gods, then in his anger he will punish you. Soon none of you will be left in this good land that he gave you.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.24'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.1'>Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called the elders, the leaders, the judges, and the officers of Israel, and they came to the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.2'>Joshua said to all the people: »This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel says: Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. One of those ancestors was Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.3'>»I took Abraham, your ancestor, from the land across the Euphrates and led him through the whole land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Edom as his possession, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>»Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought great trouble on Egypt. I led you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>»I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry. When your ancestors got to the Red Sea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>they cried out to me for help. I put darkness between them and the Egyptians. I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them. You know what I did to Egypt. You lived in the desert a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>»I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the east side of the Jordan. They fought you, but I gave you victory over them. You took their land. I destroyed them as you advanced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>»The king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, fought against you. He sent word to Balaam son of Beor and asked him to put a curse on you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>»You advanced and I threw them into panic in order to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your swords and bows had nothing to do with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>»I gave you a land that you had never worked and cities that you had not built. Now live there and eat grapes from vines that you did not plant, and olives from trees that you did not plant.</verse>
