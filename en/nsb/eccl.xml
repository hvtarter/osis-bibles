      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Solomon) (Completed before 1000 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher assemblerlecturer, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>»Vanity of vanities,« said the Preacher, »vanity of vanities; all is vanity.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit does a man have of all his labor that he works under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>One generation goes and another generation comes, but the earth remains forever without end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun rises and the sun goes down, and it quickly goes back to the place where it began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind blows toward the south, and it turns around to the north. It whirls around continually and the wind returns on its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full. The rivers return to the place where they began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are wearisome, man is not able to tell. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which has been is that which will be. That which has been done is that which will be done. There is nothing new under the sun!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there anything of which it may be said: »See, this is new?« It has already existed in days of old, which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no memory of former things. Those who follow will not remember those who are yet to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>I devoted myself to study and explored wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens. It is a grievous task God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun. Behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>What is crooked cannot be made straight. What is lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I said to my heart, »I have become great and have aquired more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has seen an abundance of wisdom and knowledge.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I know that this also is a striving after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>In much wisdom there is much grief for he who increases knowledge increases pain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, »Come now, I will test you with rejoicing. Consider goodness.« This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter: »It is madness. And of pleasure: What does it do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I searched in my mind how to stimulate my flesh with wine. My mind guided my heart with wisdom. I possessed foolishness until I could see what was good for the sons of men. I saw what they should do under the heavens all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made great works. I built houses for myself. I planted vineyards for myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made myself parks and fruit gardens, planting in them fruit-trees of all kinds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made water pools from which to water the young trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I acquired male and female servants, and they gave birth to sons and daughters in my house. I had great wealth of herds and flocks, more than all who were in Jerusalem before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, girls of all sorts to be my brides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>I became great and increased more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem and my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold joy from my heart. My heart took pleasure in all my work and this was my reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>I looked at all the works my hands accomplished. I saw everything I had worked to do. I saw that all was vanity and grasping for the wind. It was to no purpose for there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways. What can the man do that comes after the king? Only what he has already done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways just as the light is better than the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the foolish man walks in darkness. Yet I saw that the same event happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then I said in my heart: »As it happens to the fool, so it will happen to me. Why have I been so wise?« Then I said in my heart: »This also is vanity.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>Neither the wise man nor the foolish man will be remembered for long. All that now is will be forgotten in the days to come. Death comes to both the wise and the foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>I hated life. Everything under the sun was evil to me. All is vanity and grasping for the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>I hated all the work I had done under the sun, because I would leave it behind for the man who comes after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool? But he will have power over all the work that I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun. This too is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>My heart turned to grief over all for which I had labored and all my wisdom under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>Because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom, with knowledge, and with an expert hand. But one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>What does a man get for all his work, and for the desire of his heart with which he has done his work under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>All his days are sorrow, and his work is full of grief. Even in the night his heart has no rest. This again is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink, and delight in his work. This also I saw was from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>After all, who eats and who drinks better than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>To the man who is good, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy. But to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth, to give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>For everything there is a season. There is a time for every purpose under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pull up what is planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to throw away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>There is a time to tear and a time to sew, a time to keep silence and a time to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>There is also a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit is there to the worker in his work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the task that God has given with which the sons of men are occupied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He made everything appropriate beautifulgood in its time. God placed eternity in the heart of man. For man is unable to see the works of God from the first to the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to rejoice and to do good works in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>Every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor. It is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatever God does it will be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it. God does it in order that men should reverence respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which is has already been and that which is to be has already been. God seeks what has passed by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>I saw under the sun the place of judgment and wickedness was there. And wickedness was in the place of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, »God should judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time for every purpose and for every work.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the condition of the sons of men, »God tested them that they might see that they are like animals.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>What happens to the sons of men also happens to animals. As the one dies so the other dies. Yes, they all have one breath so that a man has no advantage over animals. For all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go to one place. All came from the dust and all return to dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows the breath of man that goes upward, and the breath of the animal that goes downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>I see there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works. That is his portion. Who will bring him to see what will happen after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed for they had no one to comfort them. The oppressors had power but they had no one to comfort them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Better off then both of them is the one who has not ever been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>I have learned why people work so hard to succeed. It is because they envy the things their neighbors have. But it is vanity! It is like chasing the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>They say that we would be fools to fold our hands and let ourselves starve to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>One hand full of quietness is better than two hands full of trouble and striving after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I came back and saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is a man who is by himself, without a companion. He is without son or brother. There is no end to all his work. He never has enough wealth. Nor is his eye satisfied with riches. He never asks: »For whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?« This too is vanity and a terrible problem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>If they fall, the one will lift up his companion. Woe to him who is alone when he falls for he has no one to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>If two lies down together they keep warm. How can one be warm alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>One can be overpowered by another, two can withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer take advise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>He comes out of prison to rule as king. He that is born in his kingdom becomes poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I considered all the living that walk under the sun, with the second child that will stand up in the kings place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them. Those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Guard your step when you go to the house of God. It is better to go there and listen than to bring the sacrifices fools bring. Fools are not aware that they do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Do not be in a hurry to talk. Do not be eager to speak in the presence of God. Since God is in heaven and you are on earth, limit the number of your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>Dreams come with many efforts, trials and concerns. Fools speak with too many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>Do not be late in paying a vow you make to God. He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Do not let your speech cause you to sin. Do not say to the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of what you say and destroy the work of your hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>There is futility and emptiness in many dreams and in many words. Reverence God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the country, do not be shocked at the sight. One official watches over another official and there are higher officials over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>A king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth, with gain. This too is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to see them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of the workingman is pleasant, whether he eats little or much. However the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>I have seen a grievous evil under the sun. I have seen riches being hoarded by their owner to his downfall distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he fathered a son, then there was no support for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>We entered this world with nothing and naked and we will leave this world with nothing and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>This also is a serious evil. Just as we came we will go. Whatever profit or gain we earned we loose as if we labored for the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>All his days he eats in darkness. He has much sorrow and anger with his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>This is what I have seen. It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink and enjoy the good of his labor. He labors under the sun all the days of his life. For God gives this to him as his allotment inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>For every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has empowered him to eat because of them. He should receive his reward and rejoice in his labor. This is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>He will not often remember the years of his life. This is because God keeps him occupied with the gladness pleasure of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>God has given man riches, wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires. Yet God has not empowered him to partake of them for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>A man can have a hundred children and live many years. If he does not enjoy prosperity and have a decent burial, a stillborn child is better off then he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For he comes in with vanity and departs in darkness, and his name will be covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>»Moreover he has not seen the sun nor known anything. The stillborn child has more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>»Even though he lives a thousand years twice over, yet he has seen no good. Do not all go to one place?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>What does the wise have more than the fool? What does the poor have knowing how to walk before man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering after the desire. This is also vanity and a striving after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which exists is named already. It is known and he cannot dispute with the one that is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Seeing there is much that increases futility, what outcome is there for man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>Who knows what is good for man in this life? Are all the days of his vain life that he spends like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after his existence under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name honorrenownreputation is better than pleasant ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting. That is the end for all men and the living takes it to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness the appearance of the heart is made better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart feelings of the wise is in the house of mourning. The heart of fools is in the house of rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Oppression makes a wise man foolish emotionally unstablementally ill and a bribe destroys the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Do not be quick in your spirit mindfigurative heart to be angry. Anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Do not ask: »Why were the old days better then these?« You do not inquire wisely about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom is good as an inheritance: It is an advantage to those who see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>Wisdom is a shelter just as money is a shelter. The advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives lift to those who have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God. Who can make straight what he has made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider that God made one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing that comes after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>I have seen all things in the days of my vanity. There is a just man who perished in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolonged his life in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Do not be righteous over much and do not be wise over much. Why should you destroy yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Do not be wicked over much and do not be foolish. Why should you die before your time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>It is good that you should take hold of this and also from this not withdraw your hand, for he who respects God will come forth from them all.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>Often your own heart knows you have also cursed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>I have tried and proved all this by wisdom. I said: »I will be wise« but it was far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>That which is far off, and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom. I looked for the explanation, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>I find what was worse than death is the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are chains. He who pleases God will escape from her. But she will capture the sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>»Behold, this I have found,« says the preacher, »counting one by one to find out the account:«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>For I am still seeking and have not found. One man among a thousand I have found; but a woman among all those I have not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>»You see! I have found only this, that God made man upright. But they have sought out many devices schemesreasonings.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is like the wise man? Who knows the interpretation of a message? A man's wisdom illuminates him, and the hardness of his countenance appearance is changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I counsel you: »Keep the king's command because of the oath before God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>»Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not persist in an evil activity, for he does whatever he pleases.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>There is power authority in the word of a king. Who may ask him: »What are you doing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>He who obeys the kings command will feel no harm. A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>This is because to every purpose there is time and judgment. Even so mans misery is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he does not know what will be and who can tell him how and when it will be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>No man has the power to restrain the wind, to retain the breath of life. Neither does he have power in the day of death. There is no discharge from that war. Neither will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>I have seen all this and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time when one man rules over another to his own misery and harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>I saw the wicked buried, those who had come and gone out of the holy place. They were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly. Therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully committed to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and he lives a long life, yet I know that it will be well with those who respect reverence God and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>Things will not go well with the wicked. He will not prolong his days. His days are like a shadow. He does not respect God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a futility that is done upon the earth. There are righteous men who get along as though they were wicked and there are wicked men who get along as though they were righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I commended enjoyment pleasure, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry. That will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth: for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>I saw all the work of God. A man cannot discover the work that is done under the sun. Though a man labor to seek it out, yet he will not find it. Though a wise man thinks to know it, yet he will not be able to find it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>I considered all this in my heart and declared that the righteous and their works are in the hand of God. No man knows if love or hatred awaits him in the future.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>The same thing comes to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices and to him that does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears and refrains from an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This evil is in all things that are done under the sun. There is one event that comes to all. The heart of the sons of men is full of evil. Madness is in their heart while they live. After that they go to the dead die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>Whoever is joined to all the living has hope. A living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>The living know that they will die! The dead do not know anything. They do not have any more reward. Their memory is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Their love, their hatred, and their envy, is now gone, perished! They do not share anything that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart for God now accepts your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of the life he has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity. That is your share in this life and in your labor under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift. The battle is not to the strong. Bread does not go to the wise, or riches to men of understanding. Men of skill do not always receive favor, but time and unexpected circumstance happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man does not know his time. Like fish caught in an evil net, and like birds caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>I have seen this wisdom under the sun, and it seemed important to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>There was a little city with a small population. A great king moved against it. He built great bulwarks against it and attacked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>Now there was found in it a poor wise man. By his wisdom he delivered the city. Yet no man remembered that same poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then I said: »Wisdom is better than strength.« Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise heard in quietness are more than the loud cry of the ruler of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, yet one sinner destroys much good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies cause the perfumers oil to smell. A little foolishness does the same for the one with a reputation for wisdom and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A wise man's heart is at his right hand and a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>When he who is a fool walks along the path, his wisdom fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the temper of the ruler rises up against you do not withdraw from him for gentleness can put a stop to great offenses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun. It is like an error that proceeds from the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Craziness is set in many exalted places, and the rich sit in low places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He that digs a pit will fall into it. A serpent will bite whoever breaks through a hedge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoever removes landmark stones will be hurt. They will endanger the one who cuts down trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the ax is dull, and he does not whet the edge, he must put forth more effort. Wisdom helps him to succeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment. A slanderer is no better than an uncharmed snake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness. The result of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>A fool also is full of words. A man cannot predict what will be and what will be after him. Who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labor of the foolish wearies everyone of them, because he does not know how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child and your princes eat in the morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>You are blessed, O land, when your king is the son of nobles and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By indolence the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house collapses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>A feast is made for laughter and wine makes merry, but money answers all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Do not curse the king, no not even in thought. Do not curse the rich in your bedchamber for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and that which has wings will tell the matter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a portion to seven, and even to eight. You do not know what calamity will be upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds are full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth. If the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He who observes the wind will not sow and he that regards the clouds will not reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>You do not know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman. Even so you do not know the works of God who creates all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.6'>In the morning sow your seed. In the evening do not withhold your hand. For you do not know which shall prosper. Whether they both will alike be good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.8'>If a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.9'>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth. Let your heart cheer you in your early days. Walk in the ways of your heart, and in the desires of your eyes. Yet you know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh, for childhood and youth are vanity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.1'>Remember your Creator Hebrew: Bara, plural, Creators denotes majesty (Ge 1:26) in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near. You will say: »I have no pleasure in them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.2'>Before the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are darkened, or the clouds return after the rain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.3'>In the day when the keepers of the house will tremble, and the strong men will bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows are darkened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.4'>And the doors will be shut in the streets. When the sound of the grinding is low he will rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music will be brought low.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.5'>Also when they will be afraid of what is high, and fears will be in the way, and the almond tree will flourish, and the grasshopper will be a burden, and the caper berry breaks and desire fails, man goes to his long lasting home and the mourners go about the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.6'>When the silver cord is snapped apart, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.7'>Then the dust will return to the earth as it was. The spirit life will return to God who gave it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.9'>Moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. He gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.10'>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words. That which was written was upright, even words of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.11'>The words of the wise are like prodding goads, and like nails fastened by the masters of assemblies. They are given from one shepherd.</verse>
