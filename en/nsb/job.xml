      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Moses) (Job means Object of Hostility) (1473 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>A man named Job lived in Uz. He was a man of integrity! He was decent, he respected God, and he stayed away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>He had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, one thousand head of cattle, and five hundred donkeys. He also had a large number of servants. In fact he was the greatest richest of all the Orientals in the East!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast. They invited many others to come, and they always invited their three sisters to join them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>The morning after each feast, Job would get up early to offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them. He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>The day came when heavenly beings appeared before Jehovah. Satan was there among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>Jehovah asked him: »What have you been doing?« Satan answered: »I have been walking here and there and roaming around the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>»Did you notice my servant Job?« Jehovah asked. »There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He respects me and is careful not to do anything evil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Satan replied: »Would Job respect you if he got nothing out of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>»You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does. You have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>»Now suppose you take away everything he has. He will curse you to your face!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>»All right,« Jehovah said to Satan, »everything he has is in your power, but you must not hurt Job!« So Satan left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>a messenger came running to Job. »We were plowing the fields with the cattle,« he said, »and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>»Suddenly the Sabeans attacked and stole them all. They killed every one of your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>Before he finished speaking, another servant came and said: »Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>Before he finished speaking, another servant came and said: »Three bands of Chaldean raiders attacked us. They took away the camels and killed all your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>No sooner had he finished speaking, then another servant came and said: »Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>when a storm swept in from the desert. It blew the house down and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief. He shaved his head and threw himself face down on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>He said: »I was born with nothing naked, and I will die with nothing. Jehovah gave, and now he has taken away. Blessed be the name of Jehovah!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In spite of everything that had happened, Job did not sin by blaming God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>One day when the sons of God came to present themselves in front of Jehovah, Satan the Accuser came along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>Jehovah asked Satan: »Where have you come from? Satan replied to Jehovah: From wandering all over the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>Jehovah asked Satan: »Have you thought about my servant Job? No one in the world is like him! He is a man of integrity! He is decent and he respects God. He stays away from evil. And he still holds on to his principles. You are trying to provoke me into ruining him for no reason.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>Satan answered Jehovah: »Skin for skin! Certainly, a man will give everything he has for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>»But stretch out your hand, and strike his flesh and bones and he will curse you to your face!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>Jehovah told Satan: »He is in your power, but you must spare his life!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>Satan left Jehovahs presence and struck Job with painful boils from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch his sores as he sat in the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>His wife asked him: »Are you still holding on to your principles? Curse God and die!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>He said to her: »You are talking like a godless fool. We accept the good that God gives us. Should we not also accept the bad?« Through all this Job did not speak sinful words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Job's three friends heard about all the terrible things that happened to him. Each of them came from his home: Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, and Zophar of Naama. They agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>They saw him from a distance and did not even recognize him. They cried out loud and wept. Each of them tore his clothes in grief. They threw dust on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>JOB OPENED HIS MOUTH and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>»May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said: A boy is born!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>»Let that day turn to darkness. May God above not care about it. Let no light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>»Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it once more. May a cloud settle over it and may blackness overwhelm its light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>»About that night, may thick darkness seize it. May it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>»Let the night be barren and may no shout of joy be heard in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>»May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to lift up Leviathan Babylonian symbol of sadness and mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>»Let its morning stars become dark and cause it to wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>»Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>»Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>»For now I would be lying down in peace. I would be asleep and at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>»I would be with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>»I would be with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>»Why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>»There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>»Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave drivers shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>»The small and the great are there. The slave is freed from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>»Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter in heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>»They long for death that does not come. They search for it more than for hidden treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>»They are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>»Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged fenced in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>»Sighing comes to me instead of food. My groans pour out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>»What I feared has come upon me. What I dreaded has happened to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>»I have no peace. I have no quietness. I have no rest. I only have turmoil!«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE REPLIED TO JOB:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>»If someone tries to talk to you, will you become impatient? But who can keep from talking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>»Look, you have instructed many people. When hands were weak, you made them strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>»When someone stumbled, you lifted him up with your words. When knees were weak, you gave them strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>»But trouble comes to you, and you are impatient. It touches you, and you panic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>»Does your respect for God give you confidence and your lifetime of integrity give you hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>»Now think about this: Which innocent person ever died an untimely death? Find me a decent person who has been destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>»When I saw those who plowed wickedness and planted misery, they gathered its harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>»God destroys them with his breath and kills them with a blast of his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>»The roar of the lion and the growl of the ferocious lion are loud. The young lions have had their teeth knocked out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>»The old lions die without any prey to eat, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Eliphaz of Teman continued: »I was told something secretly and heard something whispered in my ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>»I am with disturbing thoughts from visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>»Fear and trembling came over me, and all my bones shook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>»A spirit passed in front of me. It made my hair stand on end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>»Something stood there. I could not tell what it was. A vague image was in front of my eyes. I heard a soft voice say:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>»Can any mortal be righteous to God? Can any human being be pure to his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>»You see God does not trust his own servants. He accuses his angels of making mistakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>»How much more will he accuse those who live in clay houses that have their foundation in the dust? Those houses can be crushed quicker than a moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>»From morning to evening, they are shattered. They will disappear forever without anyone noticing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>»Have the ropes of their tent been loosened? Will they die without wisdom?«</verse>

        <title>ELIPHAZ CONTINUED</title>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>»Cry out! Is there anyone to answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>»To be sure anger kills a stubborn fool. And jealousy murders a gullible person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>»I have seen a stubborn fool take root and I quickly cursed his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>»His children are far from help. They are crushed at the court of justice at the city gate. No one is there to rescue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>»Hungry people eat what a stubborn fool gathers. They take it even from among the thorns. Thirsty people pant after his wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>»Affliction does not come from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>»A person is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly up from a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>»As for me, I would seek God's help and present my case to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>»He does great things that we cannot understand and miracles that we cannot count.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>»He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>»He keeps shrewd craftycunning people from carrying out their plans so that they cannot do anything successfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>»He catches the wise with their own craftiness. The plans of schemers are quickly halted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>»They meet in darkness in the daytime! In bright sunlight they grope as if it were night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>»He saves people from the sword slander of their mouth. He saves the needy from the power of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>»The poor have hope when wrongdoing shuts its mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>»Blessed is the person whom God corrects. Do not despise discipline from the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>»God inflicts wounds and he bandages. He strikes but his hands make you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>»He will keep you safe from six troubles, and when the seventh one comes, no harm will touch you:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>»You will have a binding agreement with the stones in the field, and wild animals will be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>You will know peace in your tent. You will inspect your house and find nothing missing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>JOB ANSWERED:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>»If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>»It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas, no wonder my words have been impetuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>»The Almightys arrows are in me. My spirit drinks in their poison. Gods terrors set themselves against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>»Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>»Is tasteless food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in the white root of the marshmallow plant or the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>»I refuse to touch it! This repugnant food makes me ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>»Oh, that I might have my request and that God would grant what I long for.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>JOB REPLIED TO JEHOVAH:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>»I know that you can do all things and no plan of yours can be thwarted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>»You asked: Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge? Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>»You said: Listen now, and I will speak. I will question you, and you shall answer me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>»My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>»Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.«</verse>
        <title>JEHOVAH THEN SPOKE TO ELIPHAZ</title>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>»I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>»So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what Jehovah told them. And Jehovah accepted Jobs prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>After Job had prayed for his friends, Jehovah made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble Jehovah allowed to come upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>Jehovah blessed the latter part of Jobs life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Jobs daughters. Their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this Job lived a hundred and forty years. He saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>He died a very old man.</verse>
