        <title>(Writer: John) (98 C.E.) (Ephesus)</title>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>We have heard that which was from the beginning. We have also seen it with our own eyes. We looked at it and touched it with our hands. It is the Word of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>The life was made known and we have seen and testify about it. We declare the life to you. It is the eternal life, which was with the Father and was shown to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>We declare to you what we have seen and heard. This way you may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>We write these things that our joy may be made full complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>This is the message we heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not live practice the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say we have not sinned we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I write you these things that you may not sin. If any man sin, we have an Advocate intercessorcomforterhelper with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>He is the propitiation Greek: hilasmos: atonement, compensation for our sins. Not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>We know that we know him, when we obey his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says: I know him, and does not obey his commandments is a liar! The truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>Whoever obeys his Word; the love of God is made perfect completemature in him. By this we know that we are in union with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He that says he lives in union with him should walk as he walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Then again, I do write a new commandment to you. This is true in him and in you. The darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother lives in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling offence in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness. He does not know where he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>The entire world, the desire of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of material wealth, is not from the Father, but is from the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>The world and its desires lusts are passing away; but he who does the will of God lives forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last hour! You heard that the antichrist is coming. Even now many antichrists have come. That is how we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us. If they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they went out that it made it plain that they all are not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>As for you, let that live in you, which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning lives in you, you will also live in the Son, and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>This is the promise he promised us, life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I write you these things concerning those who would lead you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>The anointing special endowment of Holy Spirit you received from Him is a part of you is with you and you do not need anyone any human to teach you. His anointing taught you concerning all things. It is no lie. It is truth, just as you were taught you live through him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Observe the love the Father gave to us that we should be called the children of God. That is what we are! For this reason the world does not know us. This is because it did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be. We know that when he is revealed we will be like him. We will see him just as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>Everyone who has this hope in him is purified. He is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who practices exercises sin also commits lawlessness, because sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>You know that he appeared to take away sins. There is no sin in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whoever abides in him does not sin. Whoever sins has not seen him and does not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>My little children let no man deceive you! He who practices righteousness is righteous, even as he Christ is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who sins is of the devil. For the devil sinned from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was made known manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Whoever is born of God does not practice sin! His seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not from God. He who does not love his brother is not from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>This is the message you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>We should not be like Cain who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he murder him? It was because his works were evil, and his brother's were righteous.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer! You know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we know love, because he Jesus gave his life for us. We ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>Whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God dwell in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>By this we shall know we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us we have confidence toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>Whatever we ask we receive from Him because we obey His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another. He gave us this commandment!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>The one who obeys God's commandments lives in God, and God lives in with Him. We know that He lives in with us by the Spirit He gave us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit. Test the spirits to see whether they are from God. This is because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>Here is how you know the Spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you heard was coming and now it is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>You are of God, my little children. You have overcome them because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are from the world. They speak that which is from the world and the world listens to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are from God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the vital principle spirit of truth, and the principle spirit of deception error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved let us love one another, for love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>The love of God was made known through us. God sent his only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation atonementsacrificial payment for our sins.</verse>
