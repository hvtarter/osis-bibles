      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Peter) (62-64 C.E.) (Babylon)</title>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are temporary residents scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>You who are chosen and foreknown by God the Father. You have been sanctified by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood. Grace and peace be greatly increased to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>You are born to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away and is reserved in heaven for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>You are protected by Gods power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>You greatly rejoice in this, though you have been grieved with various trials for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>The proof of your faith is more precious than gold that perishes. Though it is tested by fire, it may be found in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>You love him without seeing him. Though you do not see him, you believe in him. Full of glory, you rejoice greatly with indescribable joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>You receive your salvation as the outcome of your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning this salvation the prophets inquired and searched diligently! They prophesied about the grace that should come to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching what time or what manner of time the spirit of Christ that was in them did point to, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>God revealed to the prophets that the things they spoke were not for their own benefit but for yours. The Holy Spirit was sent from heaven to make known to you what the prophets spoke. Those who spread the good news to you did this. These are things even the angels want to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Brace up your minds. Remain sober, and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>Live as children of obedience. Do not fashion yourself according to your former lusts, for you were ignorant at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>Be holy in all your conduct, just as the one who called you is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>Because it is written: »You shall be holy for I am holy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each mans work, pass the time you spend here in reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>Know that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers. The redemption was not with corruptible things like silver or gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, even the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>Jesus was known before the foundation of the world. He was made known at the end times for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>Through him you believe in God. God raised him from the dead, and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>You have purified your hearts by obeying the truth. You have genuine affection for the brothers and sisters. So always love one another intensely extremelydeeply from the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>You have been given a new birth, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and endures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>All people are like grass. All their glory is like the blossom of a flower. The grass withers and the flower drops off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>But the word of our God abides forever. This is the word of good tidings that was preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Put away all badness and all deception, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>Like newborn infants, long for the spiritual milk that is without deception to help you grow to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>You have tasted that the Lord is kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>You came to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and precious with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>The scriptures say: »I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, chosen and precious (Isaiah 28:16). He who believes in him will not be disappointed shamed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>This precious value is for those who believe. But for the unbeliever: »The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>It is a stone that people stumble over, and a large rock that people find offensive. They stumble because they are disobedient to the word. To this end they were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people for Gods own possession, that you may show the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>In time past you were no people, but now you are the people of God. You had not then received, but now have received mercy compassiondivine kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I request that you as aliens and strangers abstain from fleshly lust desires, which causes conflict in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Maintain fine behavior among the nations. That way when they speak badly about you, they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation inspection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether it is to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>It is Gods will that you do the right things and that this will silence the ignorance of foolish men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>Be free, and yet do not use your freedom for a covering for evil, but as servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Reverence and respect God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle master but also to the hard to please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is to your credit to suffer wrongfully and endure grief because of your conscience toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>What value is there when you sin, and are buffeted for it, you take it patiently? But if, when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For this you were called because Christ also suffered for you. He left you an example a copy for imitationa model that you should follow in his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>He committed no sin and deception was not found in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>When he was reviled insulted, he did not revile in return. When he suffered he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>He bore our sins in his body upon the stake, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed because of his wounds stripes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were straying like sheep. But now you have returned to your shepherd and overseer.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In like manner, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands. Even if your husband does not obey Gods word, he may be won without a word by observing the way you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>Your husband could see your chaste behavior coupled with respect reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Your appearance should not come from the outward adornment, things like braiding the hair, and wearing jewels of gold, or wearing fine apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>Let your appearance be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. This is of great value in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>The holy women of old, who hoped in God, adorned themselves this way, being submissive to their own husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are her children now, if you do what is right and are not fearful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>In the same way, you husbands live with your wives in an understanding way. Honor the woman as the weaker vessel. For you are joint-heirs of the grace of life. May your prayers not be hindered cut-offblocked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all of you be like-minded, compassionate, brotherly, tenderhearted, and humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>Do not repay evil for evil, or insult for insult. Do just the opposite. For you were called to inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>Whoever would love life and see good days should keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>The eyes of Jehovah God are upon the righteous. His ears hear their prayers. But the face person of Jehovah is against those who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>Who will harm you if you are eager to do good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>Even if you suffer for righteousness sake, you are blessed. Do not fear! Do not be troubled distressedintimidated!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>Sanctify the Christ as Lord kurios: master in your hearts. Always be ready to answer every man who asks you a reason for your hope, yet with meekness mildness and respect!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Keep a good conscience. When you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>It is better to suffer for doing what is right, if suffering is Gods will, than to suffer for doing evil wrongsin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>Because Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>He preached to the people in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>They were disobedient while the ark was being built. Yet God waited patiently in the days of Noah. But few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>This was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you. It is not the washing off of bodily dirt, but the promise made to God for a good conscience. It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>He is in heaven at the right hand of God, ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Since Christ suffered physically for us, you too must strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking that he had. Whoever suffers physically has ceased from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>From now on you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by Gods will and not by human desires lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>You have spent enough time in the past doing what unbelievers like to do. Your lives were spent in indecency, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and the disgusting worship of idols false gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>They think it strange that you do not run with them in wild and reckless living and they speak evil about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>The good news was preached for this purpose even to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>The end of all things is near. Be of sound mind and judgment. Also be sober for the purpose of prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Above all things have intense love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without complaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>According to the gift you have received, minister among yourselves, as good stewards of the increased grace divine influencelove of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If any man speaks, speak as it were utterances of God. If any man ministers, minister with the strength which God supplies! May God be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ. The glory and dominion belong to God forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved ones do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, for it comes upon you like a test, as though some strange thing were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>As much as you are partakers of Christs sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other peoples business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>If a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. If it begins with us first what will it be like in the end for those who do not obey the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>If the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend themselves in well doing to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>I exhort the elders among you. I too am an older man and a witness of the sufferings of Christ. I am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Shepherd the flock of God in your care. Exercise the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God. Do not do it for dishonest gain, but eagerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>Do not lord it over your charge, but make yourselves examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>When the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, you younger men, be subject to the older men. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another. God resists the proud, but gives loving kindness to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you at the proper time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking whom he may devour consume.</verse>
