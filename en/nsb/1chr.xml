        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.1'>The following men joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who fought beside David in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.2'>All of them were expert archers who could shoot arrows or sling stones with their left hand as well as their right. They were all relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.3'>Their leader was Ahiezer son of Shemaah from Gibeah; his brother Joash was second-in-command. These were the other warriors: Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.8'>Some brave and experienced warriors from the tribe of Gad also defected to David while he was at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were expert with both shield and spear, as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.9'>Ezer was their leader. Obadiah was second. Eliab was third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.10'>Mishmannah was fourth. Jeremiah was fifth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.15'>They crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding at the beginning of the year and drove out all the people living in the lowlands on both the east and west banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.16'>Others from Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.17'>David went out to meet them and said: »If you have come in peace to help me, we are friends. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I am innocent, then may the God of our ancestors see and judge you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.18'>Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who later became a leader among the Thirty, and he said: »We are yours, David! We are on your side, son of Jesse. Peace and prosperity be with you, and success to all who help you, for your God is the one who helps you.« So David let them join him, and he made them officers over his troops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.19'>Some men from Manasseh defected from the Israelite army and joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. But as it turned out, the Philistine leaders refused to let David and his men go with them. After much discussion, they sent them back, for they said: »It will cost us our lives if David switches loyalties to Saul and turns against us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.20'>Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who defected to David as he was returning to Ziklag: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each commanded a thousand troops from the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.21'>They helped David chase down bands of raiders, for they were all brave and able warriors who became commanders in his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.22'>Day after day more men joined David until he had a great army, like the army of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.23'>These are the numbers of armed warriors who joined David at Hebron. They were all eager to see David become king instead of Saul, just as Jehovah had promised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.29'>From the tribe of Benjamin, Sauls relatives, there were three thousand warriors. Most of the men from Benjamin had remained loyal to Saul until this time.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.38'>All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of making David the king of Israel. In fact, all Israel agreed that David should be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.39'>They feasted and drank with David for three days. Their relatives had made preparations for their arrival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.12.40'>People from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. Vast supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine; olive oil, cattle, and sheep were brought to the celebration. There was great joy throughout the land of Israel</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.1'>David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.2'>He then said to the whole assembly of Israel: »If it seems good to you and if it is the will of Jehovah our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.3'>»Let us bring the Ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.4'>The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.5'>David assembled all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo to the entrance to Hamath, to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.6'>David and all the people of Israel with him went to Baalah of Judah Kiriath Jearim. They went to bring the Ark of Jehovah God from there. He is enthroned between the cherubim on the Ark that is called by his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.7'>They moved the Ark of God from Abinadabs house on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio guided it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.8'>David and all the people of Israel celebrated with all their might before God. They did it with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.9'>When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark, because the bulls stumbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.10'>Jehovahs anger burned against Uzzah. He struck him down because he had put his hand on the Ark. So he died there before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.11'>David was angry because Jehovahs wrath had broken out against Uzzah. To this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. Outbreak against Uzzah</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.12'>David was afraid of God that day and asked: »How can I ever bring the Ark of God to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.13'>He did not take the Ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.13.14'>The Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months. Jehovah blessed his household and everything he had.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.8'>The Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel. So they went up in full force to search for him. David heard about it and went out to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.9'>The Philistines raided the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.10'>David inquired of God: »Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered him: »Go, I will hand them over to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.11'>David and his men went to Baal Perazim. He defeated them there. He said: »As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.« So that place was called Baal Perazim the lord who breaks out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.12'>The Philistines abandoned their gods. So David gave orders to burn them in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.13'>Once more the Philistines raided the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.14'>David inquired of God again, and God answered him: »Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.15'>»As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle. That will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.14.17'>Thus Davids fame spread throughout every land. Jehovah made all the nations fear him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.1'>David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David. Then he prepared a place for Gods Ark and pitched a tent for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.2'>David insisted that only the Levites carry Gods Ark because Jehovah had chosen them to carry his Ark and to serve him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.3'>David called together all Israel at Jerusalem to bring Jehovahs Ark to the place he had prepared for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.4'>David also called together Aarons descendants and the Levites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.12'>He said to them: »You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your brothers must perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. Then bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I prepared for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.13'>»Because you Levites were not there the first time, Jehovah our God struck us. We had not dedicated our lives to serving him in the way he designated.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.14'>So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy in order to move the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.15'>The Levites carried Gods Ark on their shoulders. They used poles as Moses had commanded according to Jehovahs instructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.16'>David told the Levite leaders to appoint some of their brothers to serve as musicians. They were expected to play music on harps, lyres, and cymbals to produce joyful music for singing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.17'>So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel, and from his relatives they appointed Asaph Berechiahs son. From their own relatives, Meraris descendants, they appointed Ethan son of Kushaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.18'>In addition, they appointed their relatives from the second division: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah. Obed Edom and Jeiel were appointed gatekeepers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.25'>Thus David, the leaders of Israel, and the armys commanders joyfully went to get the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant from Obed Edoms house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.26'>Because God helped the Levites who carried the Ark of the Jehovahs Covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.27'>David was dressed in a fine linen robe, as were all the Levites who carried the Ark, the Levites who were singers, and Chenaniah, the leader of the musicians prophetic songs. David also wore a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.28'>All Israel brought the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams horns, trumpets, cymbals, harps, and lyres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.15.29'>When the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant came to the City of David, Sauls daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, so she despised him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.2'>King David stood there and said: »Listen to me relatives brothers and sisters and subjects. I had my heart set on building the Temple where the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant could be placed. This Temple will be a stool for our Gods feet, and I have made preparations to build it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.3'>»However God told me: You must not build the Temple for my name because you have fought wars and caused bloodshed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.4'>»Yet, from my entire family Jehovah God of Israel chose me to be king of Israel for as long as I live. He had chosen the tribe of Judah to lead Israel. From the families of Judah he chose my fathers family. From among my fathers sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.5'>»Of all my sons, for Jehovah has given me many sons, he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of Jehovahs kingdom to rule Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.6'>»He told me: Your son Solomon will build my Temple and my courtyards because I have chosen him to be my son. I will be his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.7'>»I will establish his kingdom for a very long time if he will remain determined to obey my commands and laws, as he is doing today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.8'>»I order you in the sight of Israel, Jehovahs congregation. And as our God listens dedicate your lives to doing everything Jehovah your God has commanded. Then you will be able to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.9'>»You my son Solomon, learn to know your fathers God. Serve Jehovah wholeheartedly and willingly because he searches every heart and understands every thought we have. If you dedicate your life to serving him, he will accept you. On the other hand if you abandon him, he will reject you from then on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.10'>»So be careful, because Jehovah has chosen you to build the Temple as his holy place. Be strong, and do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.11'>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the entrance hall and the Temple, the storerooms, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the throne of mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.12'>He gave him plans for the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple and for all the rooms around it. These rooms served as treasuries for Gods Temple and the gifts dedicated to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.13'>He determined the divisions of the priests and Levites. He planned all the work done for worship in Jehovahs Temple. He designed all the utensils for worship in Jehovahs Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.14'>David specified the weight of gold to be used for each of the utensils for worship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.15'>the weight of the gold lamp stands and their gold lamps that is, the weight of gold for each lamp stand and its lamps, the weight of silver for each silver lamp stand and its lamps according to the use of each lamp stand for worship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.16'>the weight of gold for each table with the rows of bread, and the silver for the silver tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.17'>the pure gold for the forks, bowls, and pitchers, the weight of each gold bowl, the weight of each silver bowl,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.18'>and the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave Solomon the plans for the chariot, that is, the gold angels with their wings spread to cover the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.19'>David said: »All this was written for me by Jehovahs hand. He made all the details of the plan clear to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.20'>David also told his son Solomon: Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do no be afraid or terrified. Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not abandon you until all the work on Jehovahs Temple is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.21'>Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites for every type of worship in Gods Temple. You have with you every skilled worker to do the work. In addition, all the leaders and people are at your command.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.1'>King David announced to the entire assembly: »God has chosen my son Solomon. He is however young and lacks experience. The work to be done is enormous, because this is not a palace for people but a Temple for Jehovah God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>»I have made every effort to prepare materials for the Temple: gold, silver, bronze, iron, timber, precious stones and gems, stones for mosaics, and quantities of marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>»Over and above all this that I have provided, I have given silver and gold from my personal property because of my love for Gods Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>»I have given one hundred and fifteen tons of the finest gold and two hundred and sixty five tons of pure silver for decorating the walls of the Temple</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>and for all the objects which the skilled workers are to make. Now who else is willing to give a generous offering to Jehovah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the heads of the clans, the officials of the tribes, the commanders of the army, and the administrators of the royal property volunteered to give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>They gave the following for the work on the Temple: one hundred and ninety tons of gold, three hundred and eighty tons of silver, six hundred and seventy five tons of bronze, and three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.8'>Those who had precious stones gave them to the Temple treasury, which was administered by Jehiel of the Levite clan of Gershon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>The people gave willingly to Jehovah and were happy that so much had been given. King David also was extremely happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>»There in front of the whole assembly King David praised Jehovah. He said: Jehovah, God of our father ancester Israel. May you be praised forever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>»You are great and powerful, glorious, splendid, and majestic. Everything in heaven and earth is yours, and you, O Jehovah, are king, supreme ruler over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>»All riches and wealth come from you. You rule everything by your strength and power. You are able to make anyone great and strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>»Now, our God, we give you thanks, and we praise your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>»Yet my people and I cannot really give you anything. This is because everything is a gift from you, and we have only given back what is yours already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>»You know, O Jehovah that we pass through life like exiles and strangers, as our ancestors did. Our days are like a passing shadow, and we cannot escape death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>»O Jehovah, our God, we have brought together all this wealth to build a Temple to honor your holy name. It all came from you and all belongs to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>»I well know, O my God, that you test everyones heart and are pleased with people of integrity. In honesty and sincerity I have willingly given all this to you. I have seen how your people who are gathered here have been happy to bring offerings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>»Jehovah, God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep such devotion always strong in your peoples hearts and keep them always faithful to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>»Give my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to obey everything that you command and to build the Temple for which I have made these preparations.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>Then David commanded the people: Praise Jehovah your God! The entire assembly praised Jehovah, the God of their ancestors. They bowed low and gave honor to Jehovah and also to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>The following day they killed animals as sacrifices, dedicating them to Jehovah. Then they gave them to the people to eat. In addition, they sacrificed a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, which they burned whole on the altar. They also brought the offerings of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>That day they were very happy as they ate and drank in the presence of Jehovah. For a second time they proclaimed Solomon king. In the name of Jehovah they anointed him as their ruler and Zadok as priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>So Solomon succeeded his father David on the throne Jehovah had established. He was a successful king, and the whole nation of Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>All the officials and soldiers, and even all of Davids other sons, promised to be loyal to Solomon as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>Jehovah made the whole nation stand in awe of Solomon. He made him more glorious than any other king that had ruled Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>for forty years. He ruled in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>He died at a very old age, wealthy and respected, and his son Solomon succeeded him as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>The history of King David from beginning to end is recorded in the records of the three prophets, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>The records tell how he ruled, how powerful he was, and all the things that happened to him, to Israel, and to the surrounding kingdoms.</verse>
