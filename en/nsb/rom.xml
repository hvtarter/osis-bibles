      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (56 C.E.) (Corinth)</title>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, appointed set apart for the good news of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>He promised this long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>This is about his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who came from the seed of David according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>He was declared to be the Son of God with power through the Spirit of Holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>Through whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, respecting his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>You are among those called to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God and called to be holy ones: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God for all of you through Jesus Christ, for your faith is reported throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit whole heart and mind in the good news of his Son. Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>I pray that I might by the will of God successfully come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each others faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>I want you to know, brothers, that I was often determined to come to you, but was hindered until now, that I might have some fruit among you as well as the rest of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians, both to the wise, and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>I am ready to preach the good news to you in Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>I am not ashamed of the good news; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who exerts active faith believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>It reveals the righteousness of God from faith-to-faith for it is written: »The righteous shall live by faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>That which is known about God is clear to them, for God revealed it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>His invisible attributes are clearly seen since the creation of the world. The things made prove His eternal power and divine nature. Mankind has no excuse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>for when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God. They did not thank him and were vain in their reasoning, for their foolish hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Claiming to be wise, they became fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>God gave them up to uncleanness because of the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creation more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>Also the men left the natural use of the woman and burned in their lust, one toward another; men with men working that which is obscene. They receive full recompense due for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>They did not like to retain God in their knowledge, so God gave them over to a reprobate depraved mind, to do things that are not fitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>They are filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil mindedness; they are whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, and unmerciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>They know the judgment of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death! And yet, they not only do the same, but also approve of those who do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>You who judge have no excuse. For when you judge another you condemn yourself. After all you do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We are sure that the judgment of God, according to truth, is against those who commit such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>What do you reason O man? When you judge these things, and you also do them, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering? Do you not know that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>Thanks to your stubborn and unrepentant heart, you store up wrath for yourself, in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>He will render to each according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>He offers everlasting life for those who search for incorruptible glory and honor by enduring in good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>Those who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will receive wrath and indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>There will be tribulation and distress on every person who works evil, for the Jew first and for the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>There will be glory, honor and peace to every one who does good works, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>God is not partial! God does not play favorites!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For all who have sinned without law will perish without law. All who have sinned under law will be judged under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>The hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When those of the nations, who have no law, practice by nature the things of the law they are a law to themselves even though they do not have any law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>They show the work of the law written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears witness, and their thoughts accuse or excuse them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>This is in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>If you are a Jew in name and are resting on the law and taking glory in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>you know his will. You approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>And you have confidence that you are a leader of the blind, a light to those in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>You are an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You then who teach another, do you teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say man should not commit adultery do you commit adultery? You who abhors idols do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>The name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, just as it is written. (Ezekiel 36:20, 21)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision is a benefit if you obey the law. But if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If therefore someone not circumcised obeys the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be considered circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>The uncircumcised person is by nature, fulfilling the law. He will judge you because you transgress the law with your written code and circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>He is not a Jew who is one on the outside. Neither is circumcision that which is on the outside in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he is a Jew who is so on the inside with circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then is the superiority of the Jew? What is the benefit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way. First they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what? If some have not believed, will their unbelief make the faith of God of no effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Certainly not! But let God be true, and every man false. It is written: So that you should be proved righteous in your words and should overcome when you are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>If our unrighteousness defines Gods righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his anger is he? I speak in human terms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Not at all! For how will God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But what if my untruth serves Gods glory by making his truth stand out more clearly? Why should I be condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Why not say, »Let us do evil so that good may come?« Some people have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing! They should be condemned and they will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>Are we Jews in any better condition than the people of the nations? Not at all! I have already shown that Jews and the people of the nations are all under the power of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>The Scriptures say: »There is no one who is righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>»There is no one who has insight. No one seeks God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>»All have turned away from God; they have all done wrong. No one does what is right, not even one.« (Psalm 53:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>»Their throat is an open grave. They have practiced deceit with their tongues. The poison of snakes is under their lips.« (Psalm 5:9)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>»Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.« (Psalm 10:7)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>»Their feet are swift to shed blood.« (Proverbs 1:15)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>»Destruction and misery are in their ways.« (Isaiah 59:7)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>»They have not known the way of peace.« (Isaiah 59:7, 8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no respect reverence for God before their eyes. (Psalm 36:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law. Every mouth may be stopped and the entire world may become liable to God for punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>No flesh will be justified before God by works of the law. Knowledge of sin comes from the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>God makes people righteous through their active faith in Jesus Christ. God does this to all who believe in Christ, because there is no difference at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>God displayed Christ publicly as propitiation atonement by his blood through faith. It demonstrated his righteousness. It was through the forbearance of God that he passed by the sins that had taken place before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>It showed his righteousness at this present season that he might himself be righteous, and the justifier of he who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is the boasting? It is excluded. Is it by law? Is it by works? No, it is by a principle of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We reason therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the nations also? Yes, of the nations also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>If God is one he will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we nullify the law through faith? No we do not! In fact, we establish continuestand byuphold the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say about Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If Abraham was declared righteous by works, he could boast, but not to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the scriptures say? »Abraham believed Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.« (Genesis 15:6)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>The pay is counted to the man who works. It is not as grace but as a debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>He who does not work but believes in him who justifies absolves the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>David also pronounces blessing on the man, to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>saying: »Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>»Blessed is the man to whom, Jehovah will not impute sin.« (Psalm 32:2)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say: »To Abraham his faith was counted for righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was not circumcised. That way he could be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be counted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>The father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of faith of our father Abraham that he had when he was not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>The promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world was not through the law but through righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>The law produces wrath violent passionindignation. But where there is no law there is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>For this reason it is by faith that it may be according to grace divine influenceloving-kindness. The promise may be sure to all descendants! This is not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is by the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>It is written: »I have made you a father of many nations.« This was in the presence of God, the one in whom he believed. He gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which does not exist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>In hope against hope Abraham believed that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken: »So your descendants will be.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>Not being weak in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead he being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarahs womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>Yet, he looked to the promise of God. He did not waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith. He gave the glory to God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>He was fully assured that what he had promised, he was able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>»It was counted to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was counted to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>It is also for our sake, to whom it shall be counted, who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification acquittal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>We are justified acquittedmade righteous by faith. And we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>We have access to grace Gods favor by faith through him. This is where we stand. We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>Not only that, but we also rejoice in our tribulations knowing that tribulation produces endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>Tribulation produces an approved condition and an approved condition produces hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts. It comes through Holy Spirit, which is Gods gift to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>While we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. Perhaps for the good man some one would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God demonstrates commends his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more, now justified by his blood, we will be saved from the wrath of God through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son. Being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation restorationatonementdivine favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, through one-man sin entered into the world, and death through sin. So death passed to all men, for all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>Until the law sin was in the world. Sin is not imputed put on account when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even for those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adams transgression. Adam is in some ways like Christ who came later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the two are not the same, because Gods gift spiritual endowment is not like Adams sin. It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man. But Gods grace is much greater, and so is his gift to so many people through the loving-kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And there is a difference between Gods gift spiritual endowment and the sin of one man. After the one sin, came the guilty judgment; but after so many sins, comes the undeserved gift of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>It was by the transgression of the one that death ruled as king through that one. Even more so shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, rule as kings in life by the one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>The result of one trespass was condemnation for all men. The result of righteousness was justification acquittal, which brings life for all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>Through the disobedience of one man many have been made sinners. Yet through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>The law came that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased Gods loving kindness increased even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>And what for? Just as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ; that you should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did that which is good become death to me? God forbid! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good. This way sin might be shown to be sin. Through the commandment sin could be recognized.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>God did what the Law could not do, because human nature was weak. He sent his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and do away with sin. So he condemned sin in sinful human nature.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>They who live according to flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh. They who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>The mind of sinful flesh fleshly thought means death; but the mind influenced by the Spirit gives life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>This is because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God. It is not subject to the law of God for it cannot be.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>If the first piece is holy, the lump is also holy. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Some of the branches are broken off. You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them. Therefore you partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>Do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say, »The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>They were broken off because of unbelief! You stand by faith! Do not be conceited but be reverent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>God did not spare the natural branches and he will not spare you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Observe both Gods kindness and severity. Severity is for those who fail to continue. But kindness is for you as long as you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>If they do not continue in unbelief they will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>If you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a garden olive tree: how much more could these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret, lest you should be wise in your own conceits estimation. Blindness has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations comes in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>In this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: The deliverer will come out of Zion and will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>Concerning the good news, they are enemies for your sakes. With reference to the chosen ones, they are beloved for the fathers sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>In times past you have not believed did not obey God. Yet you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>Even so these also do not believe now. Through the mercy shown they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has stopped all disobedience so he might show mercy to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments. His ways are beyond human understanding!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known the mind of Jehovah? Or who has been his counselor? (Isaiah 40:13)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every person be subject to superior authorities. For there is no authority except by God. God allows the authorities to serve in their positions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whoever opposes the authority resists the ordinance of God. Those who resist will receive judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are objects of fear, not to good works, but to the evil. Will you not have respect for the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>He is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>You must be in subjection, not only because of that wrath, but also for the sake of your conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>That is why you pay taxes. They are Gods ministers continually serving this very purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all their due. Provide tribute to whom tribute is due. Give custom to whom custom is owed. Render fear to whom fear is owed and offer honor to whom honor is deserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man any thing but to love one another. He that loves another has fulfilled obeyed the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For the Law code says: You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness, and you must not covet. If there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying; namely, you must love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no ill to his neighbor. Therefore love is the laws fulfillment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>You know the time. It is the hour for you to awake from sleep. Now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far along and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk honestly as in the daytime, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and loose conduct, not in strife and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>Put on live likeclothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Accept the man who has a weak faith, but not to entertain doubtful thinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For one believes that he may eat all things. Another who is weak eats only vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating. Let the one who does not eat judge him that eats, for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you to judge another mans servant? He stands or falls before his own master. Yes, he will be made to stand for God can make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One person judges one day above another. Another person judges every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who regards the day regards it to God and he who does not regard the day does not regard it to God. He, who eats, eats to God, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat does not eat to God and he gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For if we live, we live to God and if we die, we die to God. Therefore should we live or die, we are Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>To this end Christ both died, and rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>Why do you judge your brother? Why do you look down on your brother with contempt? We will all stand before the judgment seat of God Theos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>It is written: As I live, says Jehovah, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will acknowledge confess to Jehovah. (Isaiah 45:23)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then every one of us will give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us not judge one another any more. Let no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean in itself. If someone thinks something is unclean it is unclean to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>If because of your food your brother is grieved, you do not walk in love. Do not allow what you eat to destroy the one for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Do not let the good you do be spoken of as evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Let us follow after the things that make for peace, and things that are encouraging to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good neither to eat food, nor to drink wine, nor any thing that causes your brother to stumble or be offended and weakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Do you have faith? Have it for yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing that he allows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>He that doubts is damned if he eats, because he eats not by faith. Whatever is not by faith is sin!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens. We should not just please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ did not please himself. However it is written, »The reproaches insults hurled at you have fallen on me.« (Psalm 69:9)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>The things written in earlier times were written for our instruction, that we through endurance and the encouragement from the Scriptures might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>To this end you may glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one accord languageunited expression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcised for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>That the nations might glorify God for his mercy as it is written: »For this cause I will confess you to the people of the nations, and sing to your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he says: »Rejoice, you nations, with his people.« (Deuteronomy 32:43)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again: »Praise Jehovah, all you nations; and laud him, all you people.« (Psalm 117:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Isaiah says: »Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse. He will stand as a signal for the peoples. His resting place will be glorious.« (Isaiah 11:10)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>I am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>Nevertheless, brothers, I have written more boldly to you on some points, keeping you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the good news of God, that the offering of these nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I glory in Jesus Christ in my service to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>I will not dare to speak of any of those things that Christ has not accomplished through me. I will lead the nations to obey God in word and deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God. From Jerusalem, and round about Illyricum, I have fully preached the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>I have strived to preach the good news, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another mans foundation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>It is written, »To whom he was not announced, they shall see: and those who have not heard shall understand.« (Isaiah 52:15)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>I have no more places to go in these parts, and have a great desire these many years to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>When I take my journey to Spain, I will come to you. I trust to see you in my journey, and to be escorted on my way by you, after I have been satisfied with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>Now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>It pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor holy ones in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>It pleased them to do so and they are debtors for this. If the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in physical things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>After I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come to you in Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>I am sure that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beg you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</verse>
