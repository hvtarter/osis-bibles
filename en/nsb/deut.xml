      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Moses) (1473 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel. He was on this side of the Jordan in the desert wilderness, in the plain near the Red Sea Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>It is only an eleven-day journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>It was the fortieth year, eleventh month, on the first day of the month. Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all the commandments Jehovah gave him for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After he killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived at Astaroth in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side east of Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses declared the Law. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>»Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb. He said: You have lived long enough on this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>»Leave this place and go to the mountain of the Amorites, and all the places near there in the plain, in the hills, and in the valley and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>»I have given you this land. Go in and possess the land Jehovah pledged to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and to their descendants offspring after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>»I spoke to you then and said: I am not able to bear the burden of you alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>»Jehovah your God has increased your numbers. Today you are more numerous than the stars of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>»Jehovah the God of your fathers will make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he promised you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>»How can I alone bear your encumbrance, your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>»Take wise men with understanding, who are known among your tribes. I will make them rulers over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>»You answered me: The thing you speak is good for us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>»So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them rulers over you. I made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>»I charged your judges to hear the cases between your countrymen and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>»You will not show partiality in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great. You will not fear man for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>I commanded you at that time all the things you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>»When we left Horeb, we went through that entire great and terrible wilderness. You saw it by way of the mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us. We went to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>»I said to you: You have arrived at the mountain of the Amorites. Jehovah gives this mountain to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>»See, Jehovah your God give you this land. Possess it, for Jehovah the God of your fathers said to you: Do not fear. Do not be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>»Every one of you came near to me and said: We will send men before us. They will search the land. They will bring us word about the way we must go and what cities are there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>What you said pleased me very much. I took twelve of your men, one from each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>They went up to the mountain to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>They picked the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us. They brought us word again. They said: It is a good land that Jehovah our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Even so they were not willing to go. They rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>»You complained in your tents, and said: Jehovah hates us so he brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>»Where can we go up? Our brothers caused us to lose heart. They said: The people are stronger and taller than we are. The cities are large and the walls go up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>»I said to you: Do not be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>»Jehovah your God leads you. He will fight for you just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>»You saw how Jehovah your God carried you like a father carries his son all the way until you reached this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>»Yet in all this you did not trust Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>»He went ahead of you to find places for you to camp. He offered fire by night and cloud by day to show you the way you should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>»Jehovah heard what you said. He was angry and solemnly swore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>»Not one man of this evil generation will see that good land, which I swore to give your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>»Except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it. I will give him and his descendants the land he walks on. This is because he followed Jehovah wholeheartedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>»Jehovah was angry with me because of you. He said to me: You will also not go there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>»Your assistant Joshua son of Nun will go there. He will lead the people into the land. Encourage him to go there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>»The little ones that you said would be taken captive will enter the land. Your children who do not know good from bad will go in. I will give it to them and they will possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>»But you must turn around and go back through the desert toward the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>»You answered: We have sinned against Jehovah. We will fight just as Jehovah our God commanded us. When every man puts on his armor and weapons of war they will be ready to go to the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>»But Jehovah said to me: Tell them, do not go and fight! I am not with you. Your enemies will defeat you.« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>I told you, but you would not listen. You disobeyed Jehovahs command and proudly invaded the mountainous region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>The Amorites who lived there came out and attacked you. They chased you like a swarm of bees. They defeated you! They drove you back from Seir all the way to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>You returned and cried to Jehovah. Jehovah, however, did not listen to you. He turned a deaf ear to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>That is why you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>»We went back into the desert. We followed the road that leads to the Red Sea as Jehovah told me. For a long time we traveled around the region of Mount Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>»Then Jehovah said to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>You traveled around this mountain long enough. Now go north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>»Give these instructions to the people: »You will pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They live in Seir. They will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>»Do not start a fight with them, because I am not giving you any of their land, not so much as one foot. I gave Esau's descendants the region of Mount Seir as their property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>»You must pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>»Remember how Jehovah your God blessed you in everything you have done. He took care of you as you wandered through this vast desert. He has been with you these forty years. You had everything you needed.« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>We moved on and left the road that goes from the towns of Elath and Eziongeber to the Dead Sea. »We turned northeast toward Moab.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>»Then Jehovah said to me: Do not trouble the people of Moab, the descendants of Lot. And do not start a war with them. I gave them the city of Ar, and I am not going to give you any of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The Emits used to live there. They are a mighty race of giants who lived in Ar. They were as tall as the Anakim, another race of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>Like the Anakim they were also known as Rephaim; but the Moabites called them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau chased them out. They destroyed their nation and settled there themselves. This is similar to the Israelites who later chased their enemies out of the land that Jehovah gave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Then we crossed the Zered River Valley just as Jehovah told us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>This was thirty-eight years after we left Kadesh-Barnea. By that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as Jehovah said they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Jehovah kept getting rid of them until finally none of them were left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>»When the last of these soldiers died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>»Jehovah said to me Moses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>»You will cross over the border of Moab at Ar today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>»When you come near the Ammonites, do not bother them or start a fight with them. I am not giving you any of the land that I already gave to the descendants of Lot as their property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>»This territory is also known as the land of the Rephaim. That is the name of the giants who formerly lived there. The Ammonites called them Zamzummim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>»They were as tall as the Anakim. There were many of them. They were a mighty race. But Jehovah destroyed them. Then the Ammonites took over their land and settled there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>»Jehovah did the same thing for the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in the mountains of Edom. He destroyed the Horites. That allowed the Edomites to take over their land and settled there, where they still live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>»The Avims lived in Hazerim, even as far as Azzah. The Caphtorims came from Caphtor to destroy them and live there in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Moses continued: »Cross over the Arnon River. I will help you defeat Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon and his country. Possess his land and engage him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>»From this day forward I will make all the people and nations through out the earth afraid of you. They will hear reports about you and tremble and be in anguish because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>»I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following offer of peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>If you allow us to travel through your country, we will go straight through and will not leave the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>We will pay you in silver for the food we eat and the water we drink. Please let us go through,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us. We will keep going until we cross the Jordan River into the land Jehovah our God is giving us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>King Sihon of Heshbon would not allow us to pass through. Jehovah your God made him stubborn and overconfident in order to hand him over to you, as he has now done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>»Then Jehovah said to me: I make King Sihon and his land helpless before you. Capture his land and occupy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Sihon came out with all his men to fight us near the town of Jahaz,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>and Jehovah our God helped us defeat them. We killed Sihon, his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>We captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom. We killed everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>We took the livestock and everything else of value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>Jehovah helped us capture every town from the Arnon River Gorge north to the boundary of Gilead. This included the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>However, we did not go near the Ammonite towns, both in the mountains and near the Jabbok River, just as Jehovah commanded.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>»Next we headed for the land of Bashan. King Og of Bashan and all his army came to fight us at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>»Jehovah said to me: Do not be afraid of him. I will hand him, all his army, and his land, over to you. Do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>»So Jehovah our God also handed King Og of Bashan and all his army over to us. We defeated him and left no survivors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>»We captured all his cities. Not one was missed. We captured a total of sixty cities in the territory of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>»All of these cities were fortified with high walls and double-door gates with bars across the gates. We also captured a large number of unwalled villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>»We destroyed all the towns and put to death all the men, women, and children. This was just as we did in the towns that belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>»We kept the livestock and took plunder from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>»Sihon and Og ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River Gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north. We captured it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>»Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon. The Amorites call it Mount Senir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>»All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, and Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were captured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>»Of the Rephaim only King Og of Bashan was left. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>»We took possession of this land. I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of Aroer near the Arnon Valley and half of the mountain region of Gilead with its cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>»I assigned the rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, where Og had ruled, that is, the entire Argob region to half the tribe of Manasseh. Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, took the entire region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of Geshur and Maacah. He named the villages after himself, and they are still known as the villages of Jair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>I assigned Gilead to the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>»I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The middle of the river was their southern boundary, and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River, part of which formed the Ammonite border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>»On the west their territory extended to the Jordan River, from Lake Galilee in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south and to the foot of Mount Pisgah on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>»Then I gave them the following instructions: Jehovah our God gave you the land east of the Jordan to occupy. Now arm your fighting men and send them across the Jordan ahead of the other tribes of Israel, to help them occupy their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>»Your wives, children, and livestock, for you have a lot of livestock, will remain behind in the towns I assigned to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>»Help the other Israelites until they occupy the land Jehovah is giving them west of the Jordan and until Jehovah lets them live there in peace, just as he has done here for you. After that, you may return to the land I assigned to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>»I also gave Joshua this command: You have seen with your own eyes everything Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. Jehovah will do the same to all of the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan River where you are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>»Do not be afraid of them. For Jehovah your God fights for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>»Then I pleaded with Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>»O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show me how great and powerful you are. What kind of god is there in heaven or on earth that can do the deeds and the mighty acts you have done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>»Please let me go over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan River. Let me see those beautiful mountains in Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>»Jehovah was angry with me because of you, so he would not listen to me. He said: Enough of that! Do not talk to me anymore about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>»Go to the top of Mount Pisgah, and look west, north, south, and east. You may look at the land, but you will never cross the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>»Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land. So help him. Encourage him and strengthen him. Tell him what he must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we stayed in the valley at Beth Peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>»Israel, listen to these laws and teachings! If you obey them you will live! Go in and take the land that Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>»He is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded. So do not add anything or take anything away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>»You saw how he killed everyone who worshiped the god Baal at Peor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>»But all of you who were faithful to Jehovah your God are still alive today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>»I have taught you laws and rules as Jehovah my God commanded me. You must obey them when you enter the land and take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>»Carefully obey the laws. For this will show your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations. They will hear all these statutes and say: Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.7'>»What great nation is there, who has God so near to them? For we call on Jehovah our God for all things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.8'>»And what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments so righteous as the law I present to you this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.9'>»Be on your guard! Make sure you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have seen with your own eyes. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.10'>»Do you remember the day you stood in the presence of Jehovah your God at Mount Sinai Horeb? He said to me: assemble the people.

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.1'>»Hear, O Israel, you are about to cross the Jordan River. You will force out nations that are larger and mightier than you, with big cities that have sky-high walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.2'>»Their people are tall and strong. They are descendants of Anakim. You know all about them. You also heard it said: Who can oppose the descendants of Anak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.3'>»Understand today that Jehovah your God is the one who is going ahead of you like a consuming ragingdevouring fire. He will wipe them out. Then he will use you to crush their power. You will take possession of their land and will quickly destroy them as Jehovah promised you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.4'>»When Jehovah your God expels these people right before your very eyes, do not say to yourselves: Jehovah brought us here to possess this land because we live right are righteous. This is not the case. It is because these nations are so wicked that Jehovah is forcing them out of your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.5'>»It is not because you have been living right or because you are so honest that you enter to take possession of their land. It is because these people are so wicked that Jehovah your God is forcing them out of your way. It is also because Jehovah wants to confirm the promise he swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>»Understand this! It is not because you have been living right that Jehovah your God is giving you this good land to possess. You are a rebellious and impossible stiff-neckedstubborn people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.7'>»Never forget how you made Jehovah your God angry in the desert. You rebelled against Jehovah from the day you left Egypt until you came here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>»Even at Mount Horeb you made Jehovah so angry that he wanted to destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.9'>»When I went up on the mountain to get the stone tablets, the tablets of the promise that Jehovah made to you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights without food or water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.10'>»Then Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by Gods finger Holy Spirit. On them were written all the words Jehovah spoke to you from the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.11'>»At the end of forty days and nights Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.12'>»Jehovah said to me: Go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them. They have made a cast-idol for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.13'>»Jehovah spoke further to me: I have seen this people. They are a very stubborn people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.14'>»Leave me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.15'>»So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire. I carried the two stone tablets of the covenant in my two hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.16'>»I saw that you had indeed sinned against Jehovah your God. You made yourselves an idol, cast in the shape of a calf. You turned aside quickly from the way Jehovah had commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.17'>»I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.18'>»I fell down before Jehovah. Like the first, forty days and nights I did not eat or drink. This was because of all your sin you committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.19'>»I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure from Jehovah. For he was wrathful against you to the point of destroying you! But Jehovah listened to me that time also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>»Jehovah was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him! So I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>»I took your sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it. I ground it very small until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that flowed down the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>»Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.23'>»Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea. He said: Go up and possess the land I have given you. Then you rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God. You did not believe him. You did not listen to his voice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.24'>»You have rebelled against Jehovah from the day I knew you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>»So I fell down prostrate before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights. I did this because Jehovah said he would destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.26'>»I prayed to Jehovah and said: O Jehovah our God, do not destroy your people for they are your inheritance. You have redeemed them through your greatness. You brought them out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.27'>»»Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>»»The land from which you brought us may say: »Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land he promised them and because he hated them he has brought them out to slay them in the desert wilderness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.29'>»Even now they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and outstretched arm.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.10.3'>»I made an Ark out of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the first ones. Then I took the two tablets in my hands and went up on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.4'>»He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing. It was the Ten Commandments Ten Words that Jehovah proclaimed to you on the mountain. It was from the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly. Jehovah gave them to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.10.7'>From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.8'>Jehovah then set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the covenant of Jehovah. They were to stand before Jehovah to serve and pronounce blessings in his name until this day.</verse>
