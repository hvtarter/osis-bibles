        <title>(Writer: Apostle John) (96 C.E.) (Island of Patmos)</title>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>THE REVELATION GOD GAVE TO JESUS CHRIST, so that he could tell his servants the things that must soon take place. Christ then sent his angel to communicate the symbolic message to his servant John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>John testified to the word of God, the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Happy is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and obey the things written in it: for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven congregations in Asia: May you have grace and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, who is the Faithful Witness, and the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>He made us to be a kingdom of kings and priests to his God and Father. To him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he comes with the clouds. Every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn over him. So it will be, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end," says Jehovah God, "the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty all rulinguniversal sovereign.Â« (Isaiah 48:12)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, your brother and companion in tribulation and kingdom and perseverance patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, because of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day when I heard a strong voice behind me. It sounded like a trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>It said: "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven congregations in Asia: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>There was someone like the Son of man in the midst of the seven lamp stands. He was clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the chest with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet were like fine brass glowing in a furnace. His voice sounded like many rushing waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In his right hand he held seven stars. A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. His appearance was like the shinning sun in full strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. He laid his right hand on me and said: "Do not fear. I am the first and the last:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>"I am alive! I was dead and, behold, I am alive forever, Amen. I have the keys of death and the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>"Write the things that you have seen and the things that are and the things that will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>"This is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven congregations. The seven lamp stands that you saw are the seven congregations."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>"To the angel of the congregation of Ephesus write: The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lamp stands, says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>"'I know your works, and your labor, and your patience. I also know how you cannot tolerate those who are evil. You tested those who say they are apostles. They are not apostles. You found them to be liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>"'You have endured and are patient. You suffer for my name's sake and have not grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>"'However I have this against you: you do not love me now as you did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>"'Think how far you have fallen! Turn from your sins repent and do what you did at first. If you do not turn from your sins, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>"'Yet you have this in your favor: you hate the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus just as I hate their deeds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>"To the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write: This is the message from the one who is the 'First and the Last', who died and came to life again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>"'I know your troubles. I know that you are poor, but you are rich! I know the evil things said against you by those who claim to be Jews but are not. Their synagogue belongs to Satan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>"'Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil false accuserDevil is about to throw you into prison, that you may be tested. You will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful even if you must die, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>"'I know where you live and where the throne of Satan is. You cling to my name and have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness. He was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>"'I have a few things against you: you have people there who hold to the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to present a snare to the sons of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices and commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>"'You also have those who hold the doctrine teaching of the sect of Nicolaus in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>"'Turn away from your sins! If you do not repent I will come to you soon. And I will fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>"'He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations! To those who overcome in victory I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>"To the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write: This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes blaze like fire, whose feet shine like polished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>"'I know your works. I know your love, your faithfulness, your service, and your patience. I know that you are doing more now than you did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>"'But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads my servants astray so that they commit immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>"'I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>"'Watch this! I am going to throw her into a sickbed. Those who commit sexual sins with her will also suffer much trouble, unless they repent and turn away from what she is doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>"'I will kill her children with deadly plague. Then all the congregations will know that I am the one who searches hearts and minds. I will reward each of you for what you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>"'But to the rest of you in Thyatira, all who do not hold on to Jezebel's teaching, who have not learned what are called the "deep things of Satan," I will not burden you with anything else.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this I saw a door opened in heaven: and the first voice that I heard was talking to me like a trumpet. It said: "Come up here and I will show you things from the future."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in the spirit. In front of me was a throne in heaven and someone sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>He who sat there had the appearance of jasper and sardius stones. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were twenty-four elders sitting on thrones. They were dressed in white with crowns of gold on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>Lightnings and thunders and voices came from the throne. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>A sea of crystal like glass was in front of the throne. In the center around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like a man. And the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>Each of the four living creatures has six wings. They are full of eyes around and within. "Never resting day or night, they say: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>When these living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>The twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne. They worship him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>"You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and because of your will they are and were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>I saw a book in the right hand of him who sat on the throne. It had writing on the inside and on the back and was sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice: "Who is worthy to open the book, and to remove the seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>No one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the book and look inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>I wept much because no one was found worthy to open, look inside, and read the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>One of the elders said to me: "Do not weep; the Lion of the tribe of Judah of the Root of David has succeeded in opening the book and removing the seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>I saw a Lamb that looked as though it had been slain, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders. The lamb had seven horns and seven eyes. These are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>He came to the one who sat on the throne and received the book from his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>When he took the book the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Every one of them had harps, and golden bowls full of incense. These are the prayers of the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>They sing a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals, for you were slaughtered and by your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>"You made them kings and priests to our God. They will reign as kings over the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders. The number of them was ten thousand myriads times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>They said with a loud voice: "The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>I heard every creature in heaven and on earth. I also heard those under the earth, in the sea, and all that are in them. They said: "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>The four living creatures said: "Amen" and the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the living creatures speak with a voice like thunder. He said: "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>I saw a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him and he conquered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Another horse that was red went out: and power was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth. He was given a great sword so that men could kill one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say: "Come!" I saw a black horse; and he who sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: "A measure quart: U.S. dry. of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see that you do not hurt the oil and the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I looked, and there was a pale horse. The name of the one who sat on him was Death. The grave followed him. Power was given to them over a fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with pestilence, and with the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the persons who were slaughtered because of the word of God, and for the witness they gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They cried with a loud voice, saying: "How long, O Lord, holy and true, before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Each of them was given a white robe. They were told that they should rest for a little while. They were to wait until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers, who would be killed, as they were, should be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>When he opened the sixth seal I saw a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars of the sky fell to the earth, even as a fig tree drops her unripe figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled together. Every mountain and island was moved from their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the military commanders, and the mighty men, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>They said to the mountains and rocks: "Fall on us, and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>"For the great day of his wrath has come; and who will be able to stand?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth so the wind would not blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>I saw another angel ascending from the east. He had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>He said: "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>I heard the number of those who were sealed. There were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about a half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>I saw the seven angels who stood before God. Seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel, with a golden incense vessel, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense so he could offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the holy ones, ascended up, out of the angel's hand, before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>The angel took the incense vessel, and filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth. There were voices, and thundering and lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood came down upon the earth. A third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel blew his trumpet. Something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>A third of the living creatures in the sea died. And a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven. It fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The star is called Wormwood CalamityBitterness: and a third of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was struck. A third of the moon, and a third of the stars were darkened. The illumination of both day and night was cut by one third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I saw and heard an angel flying in midheaven. He said with a loud voice: "Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>The fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth. The key of the bottomless pit was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>He opened the bottomless pit. Smoke came out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. The smoke from the pit darkened the sun and the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth. Power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>The locusts were not to kill them, but should torment them for five months: and their torment was the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>Men will seek death in those days and will not find it. They will desire to die and death will elude them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. They wore gold crowns on their heads and their faces were like the faces of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>Their hair was like the hair of women. Their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>They had breastplates like iron. The sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>Their tails were like scorpions' tails, for there were stings in their tails. They had power to hurt men five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>The angel of the bottomless pit was their king. His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first woe is past. There are two more woes to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the golden altar that is before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>And the four angels were released. They were prepared for this very hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The army of the horsemen numbered two hundred million. I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>I saw the horses and riders in the vision. Their breastplates were bright red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. Their mouths issued fire, smoke, and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>A third of mankind was killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents that had heads, and with them they inflict harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>The rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshipping demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>Neither did they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven. He was clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>He held a little book that lay open in his hand. He placed his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven say to me: "Seal up those things that the seven thunders spoke. Do not write them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>The angel I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth raised his hand to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>And he swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things there, that there would be no more delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will sound his trumpet, the secret of God is finished, just as he declared to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>The voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said: "Go take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>I went to the angel, and said to him: "Give me the little book." He said to me: "Take it, and eat it up! It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will make your belly bitter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>So I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it. It was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>He said: "You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations, tongues and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>There was given me a reed like a measuring rod: and the angel stood, saying: "Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>"Do not measure the court outside the temple for it is given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies. If any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These two witnesses have power to shut the sky so that it will not rain in the days of their prophecy. They have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>When they finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and conquer them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was impaled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>The people and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and will look at them and refuse to bury them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>The inhabitants of the earth will celebrate and rejoice over them. They will rejoice and send gifts to one another. This is because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>After three and a half days the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet. Great fear fell upon all who saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>They heard a great voice from heaven say: "Come up here." So they ascended up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies beheld them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>In that same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand men were slain in the earthquake, and the survivors were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second woe has past. The third woe will come quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>The seventh angel blew his trumpet. There were great voices in heaven, saying: "The kingdom of the world has become our GodÂs, and his Christ will rule as king forever and ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>The twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>Saying: "We give you thanks, Jehovah God the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power, and begun to rule as king. (Exodus 6:3) (Amos 4:13)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head was a crown with twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She, being with child, cried out in labor pains, ready to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>Another sign appeared in heaven. It was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>His tail swept a third of the stars of heaven, and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered. He was ready to devour her child as soon as it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>She gave birth to a male-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod scepter of iron. Her child was caught up to God and to his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God. There they feed her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>War broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>The dragon lost and no place in heaven was found for him any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The great dragon was thrown down, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was hurled down to the earth, and his angels with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now has come the salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accused them before our God day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>They conquered overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they did not love their lives when faced with death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>When the dragon saw that he was thrown to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male-child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>Two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time one thousand two hundred and sixty days, out of the serpent's reach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>The serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth rescued the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood that the dragon spewed out of his mouth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>The dragon stood on the shore by the sea. I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. His horns had ten crowns on them. Blasphemous names were on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The beast I saw looked like a leopard. His feet were like the feet of a bear. His mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>One of his heads appeared to have had a fatal wound. His fatal wound had healed, and the entire world followed the beast with admiration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>Men worshiped the dragon that gave power to the beast. They worshiped the beast, saying: "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>A mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to the beast. And authority to act was given to him to continue forty-two months.</verse>
