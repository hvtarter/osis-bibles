        <verse osisID='Num.21.8'>Jehovah said to Moses: »Make a snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.21.10'>The Israelites moved and set up camp at Oboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.11'>After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.12'>Then they camped in Zered Valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.13'>They moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the desert that extends into Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.14'>That is why The Book of Jehovahs Battles speaks of the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.21.16'>From there they went on to a place called Wells, where Jehovah said to Moses: Bring the people together, and I will give them water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.17'>The people of Israel sang this song: »Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.21.23'>Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel. When Sihons troops came to Jahaz, they fought against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.24'>Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. They stopped at the border of the Ammon because it was fortified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.25'>The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns. They settled in the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.26'>King Sihon ruled from Heshbon after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.21.27'>That is why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: »Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihons capital city!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.22.3'>The Moabites were very afraid because there were so many Israelites. Also, the Moabites did not like these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.4'>So the Moabites said to the leaders of Midian: »All those people will eventually eat up everything around us the same way cattle eat up the grass in a field. At that time Balak, son of Zippor, was king of Moab.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.5'>He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor, on the Euphrates River, in the land where his people lived.

        <verse osisID='Num.22.6'>»They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then maybe we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land.

        <verse osisID='Num.22.7'>The elders of Moab and Midian left. They took money with them to pay for Balaams services. They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.8'>»Spend the night here,« Balaam said to them, »and I will report to you what Jehovah tells me.« So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.9'>God came to Balaam and asked: »Who are these men with you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.10'>Balaam answered: »Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, sent them with this message:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.22.13'>When Balaam got up in the morning, he said to Balaks princes: »Go back to your own country. Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.14'>The Moabite princes went back to Balak and said: »Balaam refused to come with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.15'>Balak sent a larger group of more highly respected princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.16'>When they came to Balaam they said to him: »This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.22.21'>Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.22'>God became angry that he was going. So the angel of Jehovah stood in the road to stop him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.23'>The donkey saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the road with his sword drawn. The donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.24'>Where the road went through the vineyards, it was narrow, with stonewalls on both sides. Now the angel of Jehovah stood there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.22.27'>This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.28'>Jehovah gave the donkey the power of speech. The donkey said to Balaam: »What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.29'>Balaam answered: »It is because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.30'>The donkey replied: »Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?« »No,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.31'>Then Jehovah let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword. Balaam threw himself face down on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.32'>The angel demanded: »Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.33'>»But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it had not, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.34'>Balaam replied: »I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you think it is wrong for me to go on I will return home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.35'>But the angel said: »Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.« Thus Balaam went on with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.22.36'>Balak heard that Balaam was coming. He went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.22.39'>Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.23.3'>Then Balaam said to Balak: »Stand here by your burnt offering. I will go to see whether or not Jehovah will meet me. I will tell you what he reveals to me.« So he went alone to the top of a hill.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.8'>»The cities you give the Levites from the property of the other Israelites must be given based on the amount of land each tribe owns. Take more cities from larger tribes and fewer from smaller tribes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.9'>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.10'>»Tell the Israelites: When you cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.14'>»Three will be on the east side of the Jordan River and three in Canaan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.36.8'>»Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe. In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.36.12'>They married within the families of the descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph. So their land stayed in the tribe of their fathers family.</verse>
