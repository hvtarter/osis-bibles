        <title>(Writer: Joel) (Hebrew: Yoh-el means Jehovah is God) (About 820 B.C.E.) (Judah)</title>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>»Hear this, you older men! Listen all you inhabitants of the land. Did this take place in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>»Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to each new generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>»That which the gnawing locust left the swarming locust ate. That which the swarming locust left the creeping locust ate. That which the creeping locust left other locusts ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>»Awake, you drunkards, and weep! Wail you drinkers of wine. The sweet wine is removed from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>»A nation has invaded my land. It is strong and very large. His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the jaw-teeth of a lioness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>»He has laid my vine waste and stripped off the bark of my fig tree. He stripped its branches white and clean and threw it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>»Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>»The meal offering and the drink offering are removed from the house of Jehovah. The priests and Jehovah's ministers mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>»The field is laid waste, the land mourns. The grain is destroyed, the new wine dried up, the oil fails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>»Be ashamed you farmers. Cry you vinedressers. The wheat, the barley and the harvest of the field have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>»The vine and the fig tree fails. The pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field have dried up. Joy has withered away from the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>»Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, you priests! Wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth you ministers of my God! The meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from the House of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>»Sanctify a fast! Call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the House of Jehovah your God. Call out to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>»Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah is near! Destruction will come from the Almighty!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>»Is not the food consumed before our eyes? Is joy and gladness removed from the House of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>»The seeds rot under dirt clods. The storehouses are desolate. The barns are torn down because the grain has dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>»How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander about because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>»I cry to you Jehovah! For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame burned all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>»Yes, the beasts of the field pant for you. The water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Blow the trumpet in Zion! Sound an alarm in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of Jehovah comes. It is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>»It is a day of darkness and gloom! It is a day of clouds and thick darkness! The dawn spreads upon the mountains. This great and mighty people have never seen anything like this. Nor will it be like this again even to the years of many generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>»A fire devours before them and behind them a flame burns! The land is like the Garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Yes, none have escaped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>»Their appearance is like the appearance of horses. They run like horsemen into war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>»Like the noise of chariots they leap on the tops of the mountains. It is like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble. They are a strong people set in battle array.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>»At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>»They run like mighty men. They climb the wall like men of war. They march every one on his way and do not break their ranks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>»They do not crowd each other. They march every one in his path. They burst through the weapons and do not break ranks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>»They rush to the city. They run on the wall. They climb into the houses. They enter in at the windows like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>»The earth quakes before them. The heavens tremble! The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars cease to shine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>»Jehovah speaks before his army. His camp is very great! He is strong that executes his word. The Day of Jehovah is great and very terrible! Who can endure it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>»Even now,« said Jehovah, »turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>»Rip apart your heart, and not your garments. Turn to Jehovah your God! He is gracious and merciful. He is slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness. He will turn back from doing harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>»Who knows whether he will turn back, feel regret and leave a blessing behind him, a meal offering and a drink offering to Jehovah your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>»Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast and call a solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>»Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>»Let the priests and the ministers of Jehovah weep between the Temple porch and the altar! Let them say: Spare your people, O Jehovah, and do not give reproach to your heritage. That the nations should rule over them and say among the peoples, where is their God?« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>Jehovah was zealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>Jehovah answered his people: »Behold, I will send you grain, new wine and oil. You will be satisfied with it. I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>»I will remove the northern army far from you. I will drive it into a land barren and desolate. Its advance troops into the eastern sea and its rearguard into the western sea. It has done great things so its stench shall arise and its foul smell shall come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>»Do not fear, O land, be glad and rejoice. Jehovah has done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>»Do not be afraid you beasts of the field. The pastures of the wilderness have turned green. The tree bears its fruit. The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>»Be glad you children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God! For he gives you the early rain in just measure, and he causes it to rain, the early rain and the latter rain, in the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>»The threshing floors will be full of wheat, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>»I will make up to you the years that the locust has eaten, my great army that I sent among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>»You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied. You will praise the name of Jehovah your God. He has dealt wondrously with you. My people will never again be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>»You will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God! There is none else and my people shall never be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.28'>»In the last days I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions! (Ac 2:17; Isa 44:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'>»I will also pour out my Spirit upon the male and female servants in those days. (Ac 10:45; Zec 12:10; Eze 36:27)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'>»I will show wonders in the sky and on the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'>»The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible awesome Day of Jehovah comes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'>»It will happen that who ever calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved. There will be those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem that will escape, even among the survivors whom Jehovah calls.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Joel.3'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.1'>»Behold! At that time I will bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.2'>»I will gather all nations! I will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage, Israel. They have scattered my people among the nations and they have divided up my land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'>»They cast lots for my people, and traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.4'>»What are you to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you pay recompense compensation to me? If you pay recompense to me swiftly and speedily, will I return your recompense upon your own head?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>»You have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my precious treasures into your temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.6'>»You sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks. You remove them far from their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.7'>»Behold, I will arouse them out of the place where you sold them and will return your recompense upon your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.8'>»I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah. And they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.9'>»Proclaim this among the nations! Prepare for war! Stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near let them come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.10'>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears! Let the weak say, I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.11'>»Hurry and come all you nations round about. Gather yourselves there and cause your mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.12'>»Let the nations be aroused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat Jehovahs Judgment! I will sit there to judge all the nations round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.13'>»Thrust in the sickle for the harvest is ripe! Come and tread for the winepress is full and the vats overflow. Their wickedness is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.14'>»Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! The day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.15'>»The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars diminish their shining.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Joel.3.17'>»You will know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy and no strangers will pass through invade her any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.18'>»It will happen in that day that the mountains will drop sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. All the brooks of Judah will flow with water. A fountain will come forth from the house of Jehovah and water the valley of Shittim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.19'>»Egypt will be desolation, and Edom will be a desolate wilderness. This is because of the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.20'>»Judah will abide for a very long time, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.21'>»I will cleanse forgive their blood guilt that which I have not cleansed. Jehovah dwells in Zion!«</verse>
