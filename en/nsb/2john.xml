        <title>(Writer: John) (98 C.E.) (Ephesus)</title>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all who know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>The truth lives in our hearts forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>In truth and love, God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father send you grace, mercy and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>Now I ask you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>This is love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment that you heard from the beginning. You should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone into the world. They do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Watch yourselves that you do not lose the things that we worked to produce. You may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does not have God! He who dwells in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>Do not receive anyone into your house who comes to you and does not bring this teaching. Give him no greeting!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>He who greets him partakes of his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>I have many things to write you. I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your sister the chosen one greet you.</verse>
