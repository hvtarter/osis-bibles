      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <title>(Writers: Gad and Nathan) (1040 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Saul was dead. David defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>Three days later a soldier came from Sauls army. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head. He knelt down in front of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>David asked: »Where did you come from?« The man answered: »I escaped from Israels army.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>»How did the battle go?« David asked. The man said: »Our army turned and ran. Many were wounded and died. King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>David asked: »How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>He answered: »I was on Mount Gilboa. I saw Saul leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry of the enemy closed in on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>»He looked my way and called me. I said: Yes here I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>»He asked: Who are you. I told him I was an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>»Then he said: Come here and kill me! I am badly wounded and about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>»I went up to him and killed him. I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm. Here, I have brought them to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>David and all his men tore their clothes in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of Jehovah, because so many had been killed in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>David asked the young man who brought him the news: »Where are you from?« He answered: »I am an Amalekite, son of a foreign resident.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>David asked: »Why were you not afraid to take it upon yourself to destroy Jehovahs anointed king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>David called one of the young men and said: »Execute him!« So he struck him and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>David said to him: »Your blood is on your head. Your mouth has testified against you. For you admit that you killed Jehovahs anointed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>Then David chanted with a lament dirgerequiem over Saul and Jonathan his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>He told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow. It is written in the book of Jashar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>»Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>»Do not tell the news in Gath. Do not announce the victory in the streets of Ashkelon. The daughters of the Philistines will be glad. The daughters of godless men will celebrate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>»Let no rain or dew fall on the mountains of Gilboa. Let its fields be barren! For the shields of the mighty lie there in disgrace. The shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>»Jonathans bow was deadly. The sword of Saul was without mercy. He struck down the mighty and killed the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>»It was easy to love Saul and Jonathan. Together in life, together in death, they were faster than eagles and stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>»Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul. He clothed you in scarlet with luxury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>»The brave soldiers have fallen. They were killed in battle. Jonathan lies dead in the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>»I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan. You were dear to me! How wonderful was your love for me. It was better than the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>»The mighty have fallen, their weapons abandoned and useless.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>Later David asked Jehovah: »Shall I go to the towns of Judah?« »Yes,« Jehovah answered. »Which one?« David asked. »Hebron,« Jehovah told him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>David went to Hebron. He took his two wives: Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabals widow from Carmel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>He also took his men and their families. They settled in the towns around Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron. They anointed David as king of Judah. David heard that the people of Jabesh-gilead Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>He sent some men there with the message: »Jehovah blesses you for showing your loyalty to your king by burying him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>»May Jehovah always show you kindness. I also will be good to you because you did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>»Be strong and courageous. Your master Saul is dead. Therefore the tribe of Judah has anointed me to be their king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>Ners son Abner, commander of Sauls army, took Sauls son Ishbosheth and brought him to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>Abner made him king of Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin, that is, all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Sauls son Ishbosheth was forty years old when he became king of Israel. He ruled for two years. However the tribe of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>In Hebron David was king over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>One time Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>At that time Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading Davids soldiers. The two groups met at the pool in Gibeon. Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool and Joab and his men sat on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>Abner yelled to Joab: »Let some of our best soldiers get up and fight each other!« Joab agreed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Twelve of Ishbosheths men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of Davids men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>Each one grabbed his opponent by the head. Then he stuck his sword into his opponents side, and they fell down together. That place in Gibeon is called the Field of Enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>Fierce fighting broke out that day. In the end, Davids men defeated Abner and the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>Zeruiahs three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast on his feet as a wild gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>So Asahel started chasing Abner. He ran straight for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Abner looked behind and asked: »Are you Asahel?« He answered: »I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>Abner said: »Soldiers are all around us. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.« But Asahel refused to stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>Abner spoke again to Asahel: »If you do not turn back, I will have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>However, Asahel would not turn back. So Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Joab and Abishai ran after Abner. It was sun down when they arrived at the hill of Ammah. This hill is near Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They became united as one and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab: Must the sword devour forever? Do you not understand it will be bitter to the end? How long before you command the people to return from chasing their brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>Joab said: »As God lives; if you had not spoken the men would have continued following their brothers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew a rams horn and all the troops stopped. They did not chase or fight Israel anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>That night Abner and his men marched through the plains. They crossed the Jordan River and passed through the entire Bithron until they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>Joab returned from chasing Abner. He gathered the troops. Nineteen of Davids officers and Asahel were missing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>Davids men killed three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin under Abners command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>They buried Asahel in his fathers tomb in Bethlehem. Joab and his men marched all night. They arrived at Hebron at daybreak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>There was a long war between the royal families of Saul and David. Davids family became stronger and stronger. Sauls family became weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>Sons were born to David while he was in Hebron. His first son was Amnon, born to Ahinoam from Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>The second was Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, Nabals widow from Carmel. The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>The fourth son was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah. All of these sons were born in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>The fighting continued between Davids forces and the forces loyal to Sauls family. Abner became more and more powerful among Sauls followers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>Saul had a concubine named Rizpah. She was Aiahs daughter. Ishbosheth asked Abner: »Why did you have sex with my fathers concubine?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Ishbosheths question made Abner very angry. »Am I a dog that belongs to Judea?« He asked. »Until now I have been faithful to your father Sauls family, to his relatives and friends. I did not hand you over to David. But now you charge me with a crime because of this woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>»May God deal with me harshly if I do not help David get all that Jehovah promised him when he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>»I Jehovah will transfer the kingship from Sauls family and establish Davids throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>Ishbosheth could not respond to a single word for he was afraid of Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>Abner sent messengers to David to speak on his behalf. »Who owns this country?« He asked. »Make an agreement with me,« he said. »Then I will support you and bring all Israel to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>»Good!« David answered. »I will make an agreement with you. But there is one condition: You may not come to see me unless you bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when you come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>David sent messengers to Ishbosheth to give him this message: »Give me back my wife Michal! I bought her for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>Ishbosheth sent some of his men to take Michal away from her new husband, Paltiel son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>Paltiel followed Michal and the men all the way to Bahurim. He cried all the way. But he went back home after Abner ordered him to leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>Meanwhile, Abner communicated with the leaders of Israel: »For some time now you wanted to make David your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>»Do it now! This is what Jehovah said about David: I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and all their other enemies through my servant David.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin. Then Abner went directly to David in Hebron. He told him everything Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin had approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>Twenty men accompanied Abner to see David at Hebron. David had a feast for Abner and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>Abner told David: »I must go now so that I can gather all Israel for you, Your Majesty. They will make an agreement with you. You will rule over all that your heart desires.« Then David dismissed Abner, who left peacefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>Just then Davids men and Joab came home from a raid with a lot of plunder. Abner had been dismissed, so he was no longer with David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>Joab came back with the whole army. He was told: »Ners son Abner came to the king. However David dismissed him and Abner left peacefully.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Joab went to the king and asked: »What have you done? Abner came to see you. Why did you send him away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>»Surely you know that he came to deceive you. He came to find out everything you do and everywhere you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>Joab left David. Then he sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from Sirah Well. David knew nothing about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>Abner arrived in Hebron. Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him. There he stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner was murdered because he had killed Joabs brother Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>When David heard the news, he said: »Jehovah knows that my subjects and I are completely innocent of the murder of Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>»Let the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a womans work or is killed in battle or does not have enough to eat!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge and murdered Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>David told Joab and everyone with him: »Show your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth! Walk in front of Abners body and cry!« David walked behind the coffin on which Abners body was being carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>Abner was buried in Hebron. David and everyone else stood at the tomb and cried loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>The king sang a funeral song for Abner: »Should Abner die like a godless fool?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>»Your hands were not bound. Your feet were not in fetters. You fell as one falls in front of wicked men. And all the people continued to cry for him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>David refused to eat anything the day of the funeral even though people tried to persuade him to eat. David vowed: »May God strike me dead if I taste any food or anything else before the sun goes down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>All the people understood and approved of everything the king did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>That day all the people of Israel knew the king was not responsible for killing Ners son Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>The king told his officers: »Do you not know that today a leader, a great man, has fallen in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>»Today, even though I am the anointed king, these men, Zeruiahs sons, are too strong for me to control. May Jehovah repay these wicked men, as their evil deed deserves.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>Sauls son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron. He lost his courage, and all Israel was alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>Sauls son had two men who were captains of raiding parties. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Rechab. They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin. Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim. They still live there today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>Sauls son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled to Gittaim. She was in a hurry when she left. He fell from her arms and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheths house at the noontime. It was a hot day, and he was resting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>They came to the middle of the house pretending to get wheat. Once they were inside they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>They cut off his head and took his head with them. They traveled by way of the Arabah all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, »Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Jehovah has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>»I once seized a man who told me that Saul had died. He thought he was bringing good news. I killed him in Ziklag to reward him for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>»How much more should I reward wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home? Jehovah has rescued me from every trouble. I solemnly swear, as Jehovah lives, I will now seek revenge for his murder and rid the land of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>David gave the order for his soldiers to kill Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet. They killed them and hung their hands and feet near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheths head and buried it in Abners tomb there at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said to him: »We are your own flesh and blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>»For a long time when Saul was still our king, you led the people of Israel in battle. Jehovah promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>All the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them. They anointed him, and he became king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he became king. He ruled for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.5'>In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven years and six months. In Jerusalem he ruled for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.6'>The king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived in that region. The Jebusites told David: »You will never get in here. Even the blind and the lame could turn you away. In other words he could not enter there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.7'>However, David captured the fortress Zion, that is, the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.8'>That day David said: »Whoever wants to defeat the Jebusites must reach the lame and the blind that hate me by using the water tunnel.« So there is a saying: »The blind and the lame will not get into the palace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.9'>David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built the city of Jerusalem around it from the stronghold citadel to the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.10'>David continued to grow more powerful because Jehovah God of Hosts was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.11'>King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. Carpenters and stone workers came with them. They brought cedar logs so they could build a palace for David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.12'>David knew that Jehovah made him king of Israel and that he had made him a powerful ruler for the good of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.13'>David left Hebron and moved to Jerusalem. He married many women from Jerusalem, and he had a lot of children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.18'>So the Philistines camped in Rephaim Valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.19'>David asked Jehovah: »Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered David: »Attack! I will certainly deliver the Philistines to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.20'>David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines. He said: »Jehovah has overwhelmed my enemies in front of me like an overwhelming flood.« That is why that place is called Baal Perazim Master of Breaking Through</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.21'>The Philistines left their idols there. David and his men carried them all away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.22'>The Philistines again attacked and overran the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.23'>Once again David consulted Jehovah. Jehovah answered David: »Do not attack them from here. Go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.2'>He led them to Baalah in Judah, in order to bring the Ark of the Covenant bearing the name of Jehovah of Hosts, whose throne is above the winged creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.3'>They took it from Abinadabs home on the hill and placed it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.4'>Ahio walked in front.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.5'>David and all the Israelites danced and sang with all their might to honor Jehovah. They played harps, lyres, drums, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.6'>As they came to the threshing place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Ark of the Covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.7'>At once Jehovah God became angry with Uzzah. He killed him because of his irreverence. Uzzah died there beside the Ark of the Covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.8'>Because of that the place has been called Perez Uzzah breakthrough of Uzzah ever since. David was furious because Jehovah punished Uzzah in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.9'>Then David was afraid of Jehovah and said: »How can I take the Ark of the Covenant with me now?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.10'>So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.11'>The Ark of Jehovah stayed at the home of Obed Edom from Gath for three months. Jehovah blessed Obed Edom and his whole family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.12'>King David was told: »Jehovah has blessed Obed Edoms home and everything he owns because of the Ark of God.« Then David joyfully went to get the Ark of God from Obed Edoms house and bring it to the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.13'>When those who carried the Ark of Jehovah walked six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.14'>Wearing a linen ephod, David danced in Jehovahs presence with all his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.15'>He and the entire nation of Israel brought the Ark of Jehovah with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams horns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.17'>The men carrying the Ark set it in its place inside the tent David put up for it. David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Jehovahs presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.18'>David finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings. Then he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.19'>He also distributed to all the people, to the whole crowd of Israelites, men and women, one loaf of bread, one date cake, and one raisin cake. Then all the people went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.20'>David went home so he could ask Jehovah to bless his family. But Sauls daughter Michal went out and started yelling at him: »You were really great today!« She said. »You acted like a dirty old man. You danced around half-naked in front of your servants slave-girls.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.21'>David answered: »I danced to honor Jehovah. He chose me to be king instead of your father and his family. He made me the leader of his people Israel. I will continue to dance and honor Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.8'>King David also took a large quantity of copper from Betah and Berothai, Hadadezers cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.9'>Soon King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezers entire army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.10'>He sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. There had often been war between Hadadezer and Toi. Joram brought articles of gold, silver, and copper with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.2'>There was a servant of Sauls family named Ziba. He was told to go to David. »Are you Ziba?« The king asked. »I am at your service.« He answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.3'>The king asked him: »Is there anyone left of Sauls family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness? I promised God I would.« Ziba answered: »There is still one of Jonathans sons. He is crippled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.4'>»Where is he?« The king asked. Ziba answered: »At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.6'>Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul arrived. He bowed down before David in respect. David said: »Mephibosheth.« He answered: »I am here to serve.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.8'>Mephibosheth bowed again and said: »I am no better than a dead dog! Why should you be so good to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.9'>The king called Ziba, Sauls servant, and said: »I am giving Mephibosheth, your masters grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.10'>»You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for your master Sauls family and bring in the harvest. This will provide food for them. Mephibosheth will always be a guest at my table.« Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.11'>Ziba answered: »I will do everything Your Majesty commands.« So Mephibosheth ate at the kings table, just like one of the kings sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.12'>Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. Everyone who lived at Zibas home became Mephibosheths servant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.2'>David thought: »I will show kindness to Hanun since his father Nahash showed me kindness.« David sent his servants to comfort Hanun after his fathers death. When Davids servants entered Ammonite territory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.3'>the Ammonite princes asked their master Hanun: »Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent men to comfort you? Perhaps David sent his men to explore the city, spy on it, and destroy it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.4'>Hanun seized Davids men and shaved off half of each mans beard. He cut off their clothes from the waist down, and sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.5'>David was told what happened. He sent someone to meet them because they were deeply humiliated. The king said to them: »Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back. Then return to Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.6'>The Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David. They hired the Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah, with twenty thousand foot soldiers. From the army of the king of Maacah they hired one thousand men, and twelve thousand men of Tob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.7'>After David heard about this, he sent Joab and all the elite troops.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.14'>The Ammonites saw the Syrians Arameans running away. They fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.15'>The Syrians knew they had been defeated by the Israelites. They called all their troops together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.16'>King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians Arameans who were on the east side of the Euphrates River. They came to Helam under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.17'>David heard of it. So he gathered the Israelite troops and crossed the Jordan River. They marched to Helam, where the Syrians took up their position facing him. The fighting began,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.18'>and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry. They wounded Shobach, the enemy commander, who died on the battlefield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.19'>As soon as the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, they made peace with them and became their subjects. The Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.</verse>

        <title>DAVID AND BATHSHEBA COMMIT ADULTERY</title>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.1'>In the spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, David sent out Joab with his officers and the Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged the city of Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.2'>Late one afternoon, David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof. He walked around on the roof. He saw a woman taking a bath. She was very beautiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.3'>He sent a messenger to find out who she was. He learned that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.4'>So David sent messengers to get her. She came to him and they had sexual intercourse. She had just cleansed herself after her monthly period. Then she went home.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>The letter said: »Put Uriah on the front line where the fighting is the worst. Pull the troops back from him, so that he will be wounded and die.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>When her mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to his home. She became his wife. Then she gave birth to a son. However, Jehovah considered Davids actions evil.</verse>

        <title>DAVID REPENTS</title>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>Jehovah sent Nathan to David. Nathan came to him and said: »There were two men in a certain city. One was rich and the other was poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>»The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>But the poor man had only one little female lamb that he bought. He raised her, and she grew up in his home with his children. She would eat his food and drink from his cup. She rested in his arms and was like a daughter to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>»Now, a visitor came to the rich man. The rich man thought it would be a pity to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler. So he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the traveler.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>David became very angry with the rich man. He said: »I swear by the living God Jehovah that the man who did this should die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>»For doing such a cruel thing he should pay back four times for the lamb he took, for he had no compassion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>»You are that man!« Nathan said to David. »And this is what the Lord Jehovah the God of Israel says: I made you king of Israel and rescued you from Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>»I gave you his kingdom and his wives. Then I made you king over Israel and Judah. If this had not been enough, I would have given you twice as much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>»Why have you disobeyed my commands? Why did you do this evil thing? You had Uriah killed in battle! You let the Ammonites kill him. Then you took his wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>»In every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriahs wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>»I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble to you. You will see it when I take your wives from you and give them to another man. He will have intercourse with them in broad daylight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.12'>»You did this secretly. I will make this happen in broad daylight in front of all Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.13'>David said to Nathan: »I have sinned against Jehovah.« Nathan replied: »Jehovah has taken away your sin. You will not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.14'>»You have shown total contempt for Jehovah by this affair. Therefore the son that is born to you must die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>Nathan went home. Jehovah struck the child that Uriahs wife had given birth to David. The child became sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and lay on the ground all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>The elders in his palace stood beside him to raise him up from the ground. But he was unwilling and he would not eat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>On the seventh day the child died. Davids servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They thought: »While the child was alive, we talked to him, and he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may harm himself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>David saw that his servants were whispering to one another. He realized discerned that the child was dead. »Is the child dead?« David asked them. »Yes, he is dead.« They answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>David got up from the floor. He took a bath, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. Then he went and worshiped in the Temple of Jehovah. After that he returned to the palace and ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>»We do not understand,« his servants said, »while the child was alive you would not eat. As soon as he died, you got up and ate!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>David replied: »I fasted and cried while the child lived. I thought Jehovah might be gracious to me and let the child live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>»Why should I fast now that he is dead? Can I bring him back? Someday I will go to him. However he will not come back to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to bed with her, and she later gave birth to a son. David named him Solomon. Jehovah loved the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.25'>He sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name the baby Jedidiah Jehovahs Beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.26'>Meanwhile, Joab fought against the Ammonite city of Rabbah and captured its royal fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.27'>He sent messengers to tell David: »I fought against Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding its water supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.28'>»Assemble the rest of the troops. Surround the city and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city. Then it will be named after me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>David assembled the rest of the army and attacked Rabbah. He captured the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>He removed the crown of their god Milcom from off the head of their king. The crown was made of seventy-five pounds of gold. There was a valuable jewel on it. David put the jewel on his own crown. He also carried off everything else of value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>David made the people of Rabbah tear down the city walls with iron picks and axes. He also put them to work making bricks. He did the same thing with all the other Ammonite cities. David went back to Jerusalem. The people of Israel returned to their homes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <title>TAMAR VIOLATED</title>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar. She was Absaloms sister. She was also the half sister of Amnon. Amnon fell in love with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>Tamar was a virgin. Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>Amnon had a friend named Jonadab. He was the son of Davids brother Shimeah. Jonadab usually knew how to get what he wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>Jonadab said to Amnon: »You are the kings son. Even so day after day I see you looking sad. What is the problem?« Amnon answered: »I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>Jonadab said: »Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him: Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her. Then she can serve it to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon went to bed and pretended that he was sick. King David went to see him. Amnon said: »Please have Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her. Then she can serve them to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>David sent word to Tamar at the palace: »Go to Amnons house and fix him some food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>She went there and found him in bed. She prepared dough and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>Tamar emptied them out of the pan for him to eat. But he refused to eat. He said: Send everyone away. So they all left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>He said to her: »Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me.« She took the cakes and went over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>She offered them to him. He grabbed her and said: »Come to bed with me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>She said: »No! Do not force me to do this disgraceful thing. It is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>»How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you, you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please speak to the king. I am sure he will give me to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>Amnon wouldnt listen to her. He grabbed his sister and raped her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>After that Amnon developed an intense hatred for her. His hatred for her was greater than the lust he felt for her. »Get out of here,« he told her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>She said: »No, You do a greater wrong by sending me away than the other thing you did to me!« He would not listen to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>He called his servant and said: »Throw this woman out and lock the door!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>The servant forced her to leave. He locked the door behind her. The kings unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>Tamar tore the robe she was wearing. She put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands. She cried loudly as she walked away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>Tamars brother Absalom said to her: »How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he is your brother, do not tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.« Tamar soon moved into Absaloms house. She was always sad and lonely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>King David heard what happened and he was furious!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>Absalom hated Amnon so much because he raped his sister Tamar. He would not speak to him anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>Two years later Absalom had sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim. He invited all the kings sons to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>He went to King David and said: »Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials take part in the festivities?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>The king answered: No, my son. It would be too much trouble for you if we all went. Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in. So he asked Absalom to leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Absalom said: »Will you at least let my brother Amnon come? Why should he?« The king asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>Absalom insisted until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Absalom gave an order to his servants: »Watch now and when Amnon begins to feel good from drinking too much wine, I will tell you, Attack Amnon. Then kill him. Do not be afraid. I give this order. Be strong and courageous.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>Absaloms servants did to Amnon as Absalom ordered. Then all the kings sons got up, mounted their mules, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>While they were on their way, David heard this rumor: »Absalom has killed all the kings sons, and not a single one is left.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>The king stood up and tore his clothes. Then he lay down on the ground. All his servants stood beside him with their clothes torn to show their grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>Jonadab son of Davids brother Shimea, said: »Do not think that all the young men are dead. They have not killed all the kings sons. Only Amnon is dead. Absalom decided to do this the day his half brother raped his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>»You should not burden your heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead. Your Majesty, only Amnon is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>Absalom has fled. The servant keeping the watch looked outside. He saw many people coming down the road beside the mountain west of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>Jonadab said: »Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>As soon as he finished speaking, the kings sons arrived. They cried loudly and the king and all his men also cried very bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>Absalom ran away to Geshur. He stayed there for three years with King Talmai the son of Ammihud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>King David longed for Absalom once people had consoled him over Amnons death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>Joab son of Zeruiah knew the king was still thinking about Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>Joab sent someone to Tekoa to get a wise woman from there. He told her: »Please act like a mourner. Dress in mourning clothes. Do not use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>»Go to the king and speak to him in this way.« Then Joab told her exactly what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>The woman from Tekoa came to the king. She immediately bowed down with her face touching the ground. »Help me, Your Majesty,« she said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>The king asked her: »What can I do for you?« She answered: »I am a widow; my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>»I had two sons who fought with each other in the field. There was no one to separate them. One killed the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>»All my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them. They want to kill him for murdering his brother. If they do this, I will be left without a son. They will destroy my last hope. They will leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>The king responded: »Go back home. I will take care of the matter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>»Your Majesty,« she said, »do whatever you must. My family and I will take the blame. You and the royal family are innocent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>The king replied: »If someone threatens you, bring him to me. He will never bother you again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>She said: »Please pray to Jehovah your God, Your Majesty, so that my relative who is responsible for avenging the death of my son will not commit a greater crime by killing my other son.« »I promise by the living Jehovah,« David replied, »your son will not be harmed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>She added: »Your Majesty, May I say something?« »Yes,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>The woman said: »Have you been hurting Gods people? Your own son had to leave the country. When you judged in my favor, it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>»We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground. But God does not take our lives. Instead, he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>»Your Majesty, I came here to tell you about my problem. I was afraid of what someone might do to me. I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>»In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>»I can rest easy now that you have given your decision. You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God. I pray that Jehovah your God will be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>David said: »Now I ask you a question. Do not try to hide the truth!« The woman replied: »Please go ahead, Your Majesty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>»Did Joab put you up to this?« The king asked. The woman answered: »I solemnly swear on your life, Your Majesty, you are absolutely right! Yes, your servant Joab ordered me to do this. He told me to say exactly what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>»Your servant Joab has done this to view this matter from a different angle. You are as wise as an angel of God messenger of God, who knows everything on earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>Later on the king said to Joab: »I have decided to do what you want. Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>Joab quickly bowed down with his face touching the ground. He blessed the king. He said: »Today I know that you have been kind to me because you did what I wanted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>The king said: »Absalom should return to his own house. Do not let him see me.« So Absalom returned to his house. He did not see the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.25'>No one in all Israel was praised for his good looks as much as Absalom was. He had no blemish from head to toe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.26'>From time to time, he used to cut his hair because it became heavy for him. When he cut the hair on his head and weighed it, it weighed five pounds according to the kings standard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>Absalom had three sons and one daughter. His daughter Tamar was a beautiful woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.28'>Absalom stayed in Jerusalem two years without seeing the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>So Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king. Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time. He still refused to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Finally, Absalom told his servants: »Joabs barley field is next to mine. Set it on fire!« So they set it on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Joab went to Absaloms house and demanded: »Why have your servants set my field on fire?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>Absalom answered: »You did not pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I am guilty, let him kill me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab went to King David. He told him what Absalom said. The king sent for Absalom. He went to the king and bowed down to the ground in front of him. The king welcomed him with a kiss.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself. He had an escort of fifty men to run ahead of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>He would rise early in the morning and stand by the road at the city gate. When someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle, Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from. After the man told him what tribe he was from,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>Absalom would say: »My friend, the law is on your side. However, there is no representative of the king to hear your case.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>He added: »How I wish I were a judge! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me. I would give him justice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>The man would approach Absalom and bow down before him. Then Absalom would reach out and hug and kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment. That way he won their loyalty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>After four years Absalom said to King David: »My lord let me go to Hebron and keep a promise I made to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>»When I lived at Geshur in Syria Aram, I promised Jehovah that if he would take me back to Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>»Go in peace,« the king said. »So Absalom went to Hebron.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>He sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel. He told them: »When you hear the sound of trumpets, shout: Absalom is king in Hebron!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>Absalom had two hundred men who at his invitation traveled from Jerusalem with him. They knew nothing of the plot and went in good faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>Absalom was offering sacrifices. He sent for Ahithophel, Davids adviser, to come from his home in Giloh. Meanwhile, the conspiracy grew stronger. The number of people siding with Absalom kept getting larger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>A messenger told David: »Absalom has the hearts of the people of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>David told all his men who were with him in Jerusalem: »We must run away quickly, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Leave right away or he will catch up to us and bring ruin upon us when he massacres the city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>The kings servants told him: »No matter what happens, we are Your Majestys servants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>The king left on foot. His whole household followed him. The king left ten concubines behind to take care of the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>The king and his troops left the city on foot. They stopped at the city limits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>All his mercenaries passed by him. The Cherethites, all the Pelethites, Ittai, and all six hundred men who had followed him from Gath marched past the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>The king asked Ittai from Gath: »Why should you go with us? Go back, and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>»In fact you came to us just yesterday. Should I make you wander around with me when I do not even know where I am going? Go back and take your countrymen with you. May Jehovah always show you kindness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>Ittai answered: »Your Majesty, I swear to you in the name of Jehovah that I will always go with you wherever you go, even if it means death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>David answered: »That is fine. March on!« So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>The people cried loudly as Davids followers left. The king crossed Kidron Brook. His men followed him. They went to the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>Zadok the priest was there. He had Levites there carrying the sacred Ark of God. They set it down and did not pick it up again until all the people left the city. The priest Abiathar was there too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>The king said to Zadok: »Take the Ark of the Covenant back to the city. If Jehovah is pleased with me he will let me come back to see it and the place where it stays.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>»Let him do to me what he wishes if he is not pleased with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>He also said to Zadok: »You are a seer, are you? Take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathars son Jonathan and go back to the city in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>»I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until you send news.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of the Covenant back into Jerusalem and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>David went up the slope of the Mount of Olives. He was barefoot and crying. He covered his head to show his sorrow. Everyone with him was crying. They covered their heads too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>Someone told David: »Ahithophel is helping Absalom conspire against you!« David said: »Please Jehovah keep Ahithophels plans from working!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>David reached the top of the Mount of Olives. He met Hushai the Archite at a place of worship. Hushais robe was torn, and dust was on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>David told him: »You might slow me down if you come with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>Go back into the city and tell Absalom: »Your Majesty, I am your servant. I will serve you just as I served your father in the past. Hushai, if you do that you can help me ruin Ahithophels plans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>»Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. You can tell them everything you hear in the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>»Have them send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what you hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>Davids advisor Hushai slipped back into Jerusalem. Absalom came into the city at the same time.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>David started down the other side of the Mount of Olives. He met Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred figs, and some wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>»What is all this?« David asked. Ziba said: »The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat. The wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>»Where is your master Sauls grandson?« The king asked. »He stayed in Jerusalem,« said Ziba. He said: »Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfathers kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>The king told Ziba: »In that case everything that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to you. I sincerely thank you,« said Ziba, »I hope to remain in your good graces, Your Majesty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>King David arrived at Bahurim. A man who was a distant cousin of Saul came out cursing. His name was Shimei, son of Gera.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>Shimei threw stones at David and his officials. This was in spite of the fact that his men and his bodyguards surrounded David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>Shimei cursed him and said: »Get out! Get out you murderer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>»You took Sauls kingdom. Now Jehovah is punishing you for murdering so many of Sauls family. Jehovah has given the kingdom to your son Absalom. You are ruined, you bloodthirsty murderer!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king: »Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over there and cut off his head!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>»What business is this of yours?« The king said to Abishai and his brother Joab. »If Jehovah told him to curse me who am I to stop him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>David said to Abishai and to all his officials: »My own son is trying to kill me. Why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite? Jehovah told him to curse. Leave him alone and let him curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>»Perhaps Jehovah will acknowledge my misery and give me some blessings to take away this curse.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them. He walked on the hillside. He cursed and threw stones and dirt at them as he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>The king and all the people with him finally arrived at their destination and rested there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>Absalom and all Israels troops came to Jerusalem. Ahithophel was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>Davids friend Hushai from Archis family came to Absalom. He said: »Long live the king! Long live the king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>»Is this how loyal you are to your friend?« Absalom asked Hushai. »Why did you not go with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>Hushai answered: »Jehovah and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I cannot leave. I must stay and serve the one they have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>»After all it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said: »Give us your advice! What should we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>Ahithophel answered: »Some of your fathers wives were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>They pitched a tent for Absalom on the palace roof. There in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his fathers concubines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God. David and Absalom followed it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Later Ahithophel said to Absalom: »Let me choose twelve thousand men. Tonight I will set out after David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>»I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged. He will be frightened! All his men will run away. I will kill only the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>»Then I will bring back all his men to you. It will be like a bride returning to her husband. Kill one man and the rest of the people return safely.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>Absalom said: »Bring in Hushai. Let us hear what he has to say about this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>Hushai came to Absalom. He told him what Ahithophel planned. Then Absalom said: »Should we do what he says? If we should not, can you come up with something better?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>Hushai said: »This time Ahithophels advice is not very good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>»You know your father and his followers are mighty warriors. They are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars. He will not spend the night with the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>»He has no doubt already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else. When people hear that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your entire army has been destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>»Even the bravest man with a heart like a lion would lose his courage. All Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and the men with him are brave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>»My advice is to gather all Israels troops from Dan to Beersheba. They are as numerous as the sand on the seashore. Lead them into battle yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>»Find him and attack him! We will fall on him as dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>»If he retreats into a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city and drag it into a valley. Not even a pebble will be found there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>Absalom and all the people of Israel said: »The advice of Hushai from Archis family is better than Ahithophels advice. Jehovah commanded Ahithophels good advice to be defeated in order to ruin Absalom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar: »Ahithophel advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do one thing. But I advised them to do something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>»Quickly send messengers to tell David: Do not rest tonight in the river crossings in the desert. Make sure you cross the river. Otherwise Your Majesty and all the troops with him will be wiped out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En Rogel. They could not risk being seen coming into the city. A servant girl was to go and tell them. They were to go and tell King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>A young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom. So both of them left quickly. They went to the home of a man in Bahurim who had a cistern in his courtyard. They climbed down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>The mans wife took a covering and spread it over the opening of the cistern. She scattered grain over it so that no one would notice anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>Absaloms officials came to the house and asked the woman: »Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?« She answered: »They crossed the river. The men looked for them but could not find them. So they returned to Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>After they left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the cistern. Then they reported to King David. They told him what Ahithophel planned against him. They said: »Hurry up and cross the river.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>So David and his men crossed the Jordan. By daybreak they had all gone across.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed. He saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown. He arranged his affairs in order and he hanged himself. He was buried in the family grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with the army of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>Absalom put Amasa in Joabs place as commander of the army. Amasas father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael, and his mother was Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joabs mother Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>The Israelites under Absaloms command set up camp in the region of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>David went to the town of Mahanaim. Shobi son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon, Machir son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>Here is a list of what they brought: sleeping mats, blankets, bowls, pottery jars, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>Also honey, yogurt, sheep, and cheese. They brought food for David and the others because they knew that everyone would be hungry, tired, and thirsty from being out in the desert.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>David called the troops that were with him. He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>David assigned a third of the troops under Joabs command. He put another third under Joabs brother Abishai son of Zeruiah. Then he placed the last third under Ittai from Gath. »I am going into battle with you,« the king said to the troops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>»You must not go with us,« they answered. »It will not make any difference to the enemy if the rest of us turn and run. It will not matter even if half of us are killed. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It will be better if you stay here in the city and send us help.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>»I will do what you think best,« the king answered. Then he stood by the side of the gate as his men marched out in units of a thousand and of a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: »Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.« All the troops heard him give the commanders this order regarding Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the troops went to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>Battles were fought all over the forest. Davids soldiers were winning. Twenty thousand soldiers were killed that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>More soldiers died from the dangers of the forest than from the fighting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>Absalom happened to come face to face with some of Davids men. He was riding on a mule. The mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree. Absaloms head became caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair when the mule under him ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>A man who saw this told Joab: »I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>»What! You saw what?« Joab said. »Why did you not strike him to the ground? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>The man told Joab: »Even if I felt the weight of twenty pounds of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the kings son. We heard the order the king gave you, Abishai, and Ittai. Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>»Would you have stood by me if I did something treacherous to him? There is nothing hidden from the king. You would turn against me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>»I will not waste any more time with you,« Joab said. He took three spears and plunged them into Absaloms chest while he was still alive and hanging in the oak tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>Ten of Joabs soldiers closed in on Absalom and finished killing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>Joab ordered the trumpet blown to stop the fighting. His troops came back from pursuing the Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>They took Absaloms body and threw it into a deep pit in the forest. Then they covered it with a huge pile of stones. All the Israelites fled to their own hometowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>During his lifetime Absalom built a monument for himself in Kings Valley. He had no son to keep his name alive. So he named it after himself. To this day it is known as Absaloms Monument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Ahimaaz son of Zadok said: »Joab let me run and tell King David that Jehovah rescued him from his enemies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>Joab answered: »You are not the one to tell the king his son is dead. You can take him a message some other time, but not today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Someone from Ethiopia was standing there. Joab told him: »Go tell the king what you have seen.« The man knelt down in front of Joab and then got up and started running.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again: »No matter what happens, I still want to run. The Ethiopian has already left.« Joab said: »Why should you run? You will not get a reward for the news you have!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>»I would like to run whatever happens, Let me run,« replied Ahimaaz. Joab told him: »Run!« So Ahimaaz ran along the valley road and got ahead of the Sudanese messenger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>David was sitting between the two gates. The watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall. He looked at the man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>The watchman called and alerted the king. If he is alone, the king said, »He has good news to tell.« The runner came closer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>The watchman saw another man running. He called: »There is another man running alone.« The king said: »This one is also bringing good news.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>The watchman said: »It appears the first one runs like Ahimaaz, Zadoks son. Hes a good man,« the king said. »He must be coming with good news.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>Ahimaaz approached the king, greeted him, and bowed down in front of him. Ahimaaz said: »May Jehovah your God be praised. He has handed over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>»Is the young man Absalom all right?« The king asked. Ahimaaz answered: »I saw a lot of confusion when Joab sent me away. I did not know what it meant.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>»Step aside, and stand here,« the king said. He stepped aside and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>Then the Sudanese messenger came. Good news for Your Majesty! He said. Today Jehovah freed you from all who turned against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>»Is the young man Absalom all right?« The king asked. The Sudanese messenger answered: »May your enemies and all who turned against you be like that young man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>The king was shaken by the news. He went to the room above the gate and cried. »My son Absalom!« He said. »My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.19'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.1'>They brought Joab word. They said: »The king weeps and mourns for Absalom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.2'>Davids army found out he was crying because his son died. Suddenly their day of victory turned into a day of sadness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.3'>The troops returned to Mahanaim without celebration. It was as if they ran away from battle and were ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.4'>David held his hands over his face and kept on crying loudly. »My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.5'>Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him: »You have made your soldiers ashamed! They saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and wives as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.6'>»You are more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. You show your officers and soldiers that they do not mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive even if the rest of us were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.7'>»Now stand up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you do not, I swear by Jehovah you will not even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past. But this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.8'>The king sat in the gateway. The troops were told: »The king is sitting in the gateway.« So they went to the king. Meanwhile, Israel fled back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.9'>All the people in all the tribes of Israel argued with one another. They said: »The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines. Now he has fled from Absalom and left the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.10'>»Absalom, whom we anointed to rule us, has died in battle. Why is no one talking about reinstating the king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.11'>What all Israel was saying reached the king at his house. So King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar: »Ask the leaders of Judah, Why should you be the last tribe to reinstate the king back to his palace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.12'>»You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. Why should you be the last to reinstate the king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.13'>»Say to Amasa: Are you my flesh and blood? May God strike me dead unless you are given Joabs place to serve me always as the commander of the army.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.14'>All the people of Judah were in total agreement. So they sent the king this message: »Come back with all your servants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.15'>The king returned to the Jordan River. The people of Judah went to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him across the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.16'>Shimei son of Gera from the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Bahurim, hurried down with the people of Judah to meet King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.17'>One thousand people from Benjamin were with him. Ziba the servant of Sauls family rushed to the Jordan River across from the king. Ziba brought his fifteen sons and twenty servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.18'>They brought Davids family and servants back across the river. They did everything he wanted them to do. Shimei crossed the Jordan River and bowed down in front of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.19'>He said: »I beg you not to punish me! Please forget what I did when you left Jerusalem. Do not even think about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.20'>»I know I was wrong and have sinned. That is why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.21'>But Abishai shouted: »You should be killed for cursing Jehovahs chosen king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.22'>David exclaimed: »Abishai, what will I do with you and your brother Joab? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong? I have been made king of all Israel today. No one will be put to death!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.23'>David promised Shimei that he would not be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.24'>Mephibosheth grandson of Saul also came to meet David. He missed David so much that he did not take a bath or trim his beard or wash his clothes the whole time David was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.25'>They returned to Jerusalem. Mephibosheth came to see David. David asked him: »Why did you not go with me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.26'>He answered: »Your Majesty, you know I cannot walk. I told my servant to saddle a donkey for me so I could go with you. But my servant left without me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.27'>»He told you lies about me. My lord the king is like an angel of God. Do what you think is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.28'>»You could have killed anyone in my entire family. Instead you seated me with those who eat at your table. I no longer have the right to complain to my lord the king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.29'>The king asked him: »Why do you keep talking about it? I said you and Ziba should divide the land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.30'>»Let him take it all,« Mephibosheth told the king. »It is enough for me that you have come home safely.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.31'>Barzillai, the man from Gilead, came from Rogelim with the king to the Jordan River to send him on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.32'>Barzillai was a very old man. He was eighty years old. He was very rich. He supplied the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.33'>The king said to him: »Come with me to Jerusalem. I will take care of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.34'>Barzillai answered: »I do not have long to live. Why should I go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.35'>»I am already eighty years old. Nothing gives me pleasure any more. I cannot taste what I eat and drink. I cannot hear the voices of singers. I would only be a burden to my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.36'>»I will cross the river with you. But I will only go a little way on the other side. You do not have to be so kind to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.37'>»Please let me return to my hometown. There I can someday be buried near my father and mother. My servant Chimham can go with you. You can treat him as your own.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>These are the last words of David: Here is the declaration by David, son of Jesse. The declaration by the man whom God raised up, whom the God of Jacob anointed, the singer of Israels psalms:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>»The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me. His word was on my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>»The God of Israel has spoken. The protector of Israel said to me: The king who rules with justice, who rules in obedience to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>»He is like the sun shining on a cloudless day. The sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>»That is how God will bless my descendants. He made an eternal covenant with me. It is an agreement that will not be broken, a promise that will not be changed. That is all I desire. That will be my victory, and God will surely bring it about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>»All the evildoers will be like thorns to be pushed away. They may not be gripped in the hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>»But with a sharp spear. They are burned on the spot.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of Davids warriors: Ishbosheth son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle, he killed eight hundred men with his spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>Eleazar was the exception. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped. He could not let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies weapons and armor. Jehovah gave Israel a great victory that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>Next in rank to him was Shammah, the son of Agee from Harar. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi, where there was a field of ripe lentils. When the troops fled from the Philistines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>he stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines. So Jehovah won an impressive victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>At harvest time three of the thirty leading men came to David at the cave of Adullam when a troop from the Philistine army was camping in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>David was on a fortified hill. A group of Philistines occupied Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>David grew homesick. He said: »I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp. They then drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it. He poured it out as an offering to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>David said: »Jehovah, I could never drink this! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives!« So he refused to drink it. Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>Joabs brother Abishai led the Thirty Warriors. In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>In fact he was just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors. Yet he still did not become one of the Three Warriors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moabs best fighters. On a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>He killed an Egyptian as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>Benaiah never became one of the Three Warriors. He was just as famous as they were and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. David made him the leader of his bodyguard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was honored over the rest of the Thirty Warriors. But he was not equal to the first three. David made him in charge over the fighting men who kept him safe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>King David said to Joab the commander of the army: »Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and count the people. That way I will know how many there are.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>Joab answered reluctantly: »Your Majesty, may Jehovah your God make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now. May you live to see him do it. But why does Your Majesty want to do this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>The king made Joab and his officers obey his order. They left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer, the city in the middle of the valley, in the territory of Gad. Then they went north to Jazer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria. Then they went to Dan Dan-jaan, Ijon, and on toward Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>They came to the fortress of Tyre. They went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>After they went through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It took them nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>Joab told David: In Israel there is eight hundred thousand who can serve in the army. In Judah there are five hundred thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>After David had everyone counted, he felt guilty and told Jehovah: »What I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Jehovah, please forgive me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>When David got up in the morning, Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Gad, Davids seer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>»Go tell David: This is what Jehovah says: »I offer you three choices. Choose the one you want me to do to you.« «</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>Gad told David the three choices as follows: »Seven years of famine could come to you and your land. You could flee from your enemies as they pursue you for three months. Or there could be a three-day plague in your land? Think it over, and decide what answer I should give the one who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>»I am in a desperate situation,« David told Gad. »Please let us fall into Jehovahs hands because he is very merciful. But do not let me fall into human hands.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So Jehovah sent a plague among the Israelites from that morning until the time he had chosen. Of the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>When the angel stretched out his arm to destroy Jerusalem, Jehovah changed his mind about the disaster. »Enough!« He said to the angel who was destroying the people. »Put down your weapon.« The angel of Jehovah was at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>David saw the angel who had been killing the people. He said to Jehovah: »I have sinned. I have done wrong. What have these sheep done? Please let your punishment be against me and against my fathers family.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>Gad came to David and said: »Go, set up an altar for Jehovah at Araunah the Jebusites threshing floor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>David obeyed Jehovahs command and went as Gad had told him to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>Araunah saw David and his soldiers coming toward him. He went over to David and bowed down low,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>and said: »My lord the king! Why have you come to see me?« David answered: »I came to buy your threshing place. I have to build Jehovah an altar here, so this disease will stop killing the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>Araunah said: »Take what you want and offer your sacrifice. Here are some cattle for the sacrifice. You can use the threshing-boards and the wooden yokes for the fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>Araunah gave this to the king and said: »May Jehovah your God accept you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>»No!« The king said to Araunah. »I must buy it from you at a fair price. I will not offer Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.« So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for one and one quarter pounds of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>David built an altar for Jehovah there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So Jehovah heard the prayers for the country. The plague on Israel stopped.</verse>
