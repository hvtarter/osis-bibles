        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the people of the congregation in Thessalonica, who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>Our friends, we should thank God at all times for you. It is right for us to do so, because your faith is growing so much and the love each of you has for the other abounds toward each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>That is why we boast rejoicehave glory about you in the congregations of God. We boast rejoicehave glory about the way you continue to endure and believe through all the persecutions and sufferings you experience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>All of this proves that Gods judgment is just, and as a result, you will become worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>It is a righteous thing for God to repay with affliction great suffering and distress those who afflict you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>You who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>They will render vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>They will suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the Lord and from the glory of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>He will then come to be glorified in his holy ones, and to be marveled at by all those who believed, because our testimony to you was believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>We pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>May the name of our Lord Jesus be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>do not get upset right away or alarmed when someone claims that we said through some spirit, conversation, or letter that the »Day of Jehovah« has already come. (Isaiah 13:6) (Zephaniah 1:14) (2 Peter 3:10)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Do not let anyone deceive you about this in any way. That day will not come unless apostasy a falling away from truth takes place first, and the man of lawlessness sin, the man of destruction, is revealed. (2 Timothy 4:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship. As a result, he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and declares promotes himself to be like God. (Ezekiel 28:2)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>There is something that keeps this from happening now, and you know what it is. At the proper time, then, the wicked one will appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>The secret of evil lawlessness is even now at work. But there is one who restrains the evil till he is taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>Then the evil lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will put him to death with the breath of his mouth, and destroy him by the manifestation brightnessadventrevelation of his coming. Greek: parousia: presence, return, being near</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>The evil lawless one will come with the power of Satan and perform all kinds of false signs and wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>He will use every kind of wicked deceit on those who will perish. They will perish because they did not welcome and love the truth so as to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>So God dispatches the power of deceit error to work in them so that they are allowed to believe what is false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>Then everyone who did not believe the truth, but was delighted with wickedness, will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>We always have to thank God for you, brothers. Jehovah loves you and we thank God that in the beginning he chose you to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>It was for this he called you through our good news. This is so you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the precepts Greek: paradosis: traditions of doctrines, teachings handed down you were taught by word of mouth or by letter from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brothers, pray for us that the word of God will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did also with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>Pray that we may be delivered rescued from perverse and evil men, for not all have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience steadfastness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Our friends, we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all believers who walk disorderly and who do not follow the instructions that we gave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>You know what you must do to imitate us. We lived a disciplined life among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>We did not eat anyones food without paying for it. Instead, we worked hard and struggled night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>It is not because we do not have the right, but to make ourselves an example for you to imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>While we were with you, we used to tell you: »Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>We say this because we hear that there are people among you who are lazy and who do nothing except meddle in other peoples business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command and warn them to lead orderly lives and work to earn their own living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>Brothers, do not grow weary of doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Do not regard him as an enemy. Admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace always grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a mark in every letter; this is the way I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
