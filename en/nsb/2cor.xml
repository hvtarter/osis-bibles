      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (55 C.E.) (Macedonia)</title>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the congregation of God at Corinth, with all the holy ones throughout Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>He comforts us in all our trouble, that we may be able to comfort those who also have trouble, through the comfort with which we are comforted from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort. It works through patience and longsuffering and is the same sufferings that we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>Our hope for you is steadfast; knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so you also partake of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>We do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that began in Asia. We were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yes, we have had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>God delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us. We have set our hope on him. He will deliver us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>You also helped with your prayer on our behalf. Many may give thanks for the gift granted to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>This is our pride and testimony of conscience. In holiness and Godly sincerity we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you. It was not by fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>as also you did acknowledge us in part, that we are your reason to be proud, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>In this confidence I was willing to come to you first that you might have a second benefit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>To pass by you to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be helped by you on my journey to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>When I planned this was I unfaithful? Or in other things do I perform according to the flesh. With me should there be a yes or a no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we, preached among you even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him is yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>All the promises of God in him are yes. Also in his is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>He who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>He also sealed us, and gave us the guarantee of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God for a witness against me. To spare you I did not come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>We do not control your faith. We are fellow workers for your joy: for you stand fast in faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>I decided this for myself that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sad, who then makes me glad? It is the same one whom I made sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>I wrote this very thing that when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice. I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears. Not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part that I press not too heavily to you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment that was inflicted by the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>To the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excess sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>I urge you to confirm your love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>I write for this purpose, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Whoever you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother: but leaving them, I went to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Thanks to God, who always leads us in triumph triumphal procession in Christ. He makes known through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God. We are an aroma for those who are saved and those who perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To the one an aroma of death leading to death and to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God; but sincere and from God. We speak in Christ in the sight of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>It is known that you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of flesh that are of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>We have such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>We are not adequate by ourselves to account for anything. Our adequacy is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>He also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>The ministry of death was written and engraved on stones. Glory came with it so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses. And this glory was passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation has glory then the ministry of righteousness would exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>Even what was glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the greater glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>If that which passes away was with glory, that which remains is even more glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Since we have such a hope we use great boldness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>We are not like Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look steadily on the end of that which was passing away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>Their minds were blinded. Until this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It is not revealed to them that Christ voided it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>When one turns to God, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now God is the Spirit and where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>We all, with unveiled face, behold as in a mirror the glory of God and are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as from Gods Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>We have this ministry to do, even as we obtained mercy, we do not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>We have renounced the hidden things of shame. And we do not walk in craftiness and deceit. We do not adulterate the word of God. But by the manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>If our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>The god of this age worldreligious, social, political, and economic arrangement has blinded the minds of unbelievers that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>We do not preach about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus as Lord. We are your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>God said: Light will shine out of darkness. He shined in our hearts. He gave the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face presence (person of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power beyond what is normal may be from God, and not from ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are pressed afflictedtroubled on every side, but not crushed. We are perplexed yet not to despair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>We are persecuted, yet not forsaken. We are struck down, yet not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>We always carry in the body the death of Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>But having the same spirit attitude of faith, according to that which is written, I believe, and therefore I speak. We also believe, and therefore we also speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>We know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>All things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>We do not give up! Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>Our light affliction is for the moment. It works more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>We do not look at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal for a season. But the things that are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>We know that if our earthly house human bodyhabitation of life is destroyed; we have a building from God. It is an everlasting house in the heavens, not made with human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>In this we sigh in silent prayer, longing to be clothed with our habitation that is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>Indeed being clothed we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>While in this tabernacle we groan and sigh with prayer. We are concerned that we would be clothed with what is mortal and be swallowed up devoured by this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>He that prepared us for this very purpose is God. He gave the Spirit to us as a guarantee pledgesecurity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>We are always confident for we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>We walk by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are of good courage, I say, and are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>We make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it is good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>We know what it means to respect the Lord so we persuade others. God knows us and I hope that you know us in your hearts consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We are not again commending ourselves to you. But we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us. That way you may have an answer for those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are beside ourselves crazyinsane it is to God. If we are of sound mind, it is to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ compels us to judge, that one died for all and therefore all died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>He died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for their sakes and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>From now on we know no man according to the flesh: even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things have passed away. Behold, they have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>All things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ. He gave the ministry of reconciliation to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ. He was not imputing their trespasses against them, for he had committed the word of reconciliation to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ that you be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>He made the one who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf. That way we might become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>Working together with him we plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain to no purposein emptiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he said: At an acceptable time I listened to you. In a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Give no occasion for stumbling offence in anything that our ministry may not be blamed discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>In everything we commend ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watching, in fasting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>Also as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians, we have spoken openly to you, our figurative heart is wide open enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>We do not restrict you, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now in return for the same in like kind I speak as to my children, you also be open open your hearts wide!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship does righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what communion does light have with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols? We are the temple of the living God. God said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people. (Leviticus 26:12) (Zechariah 8:8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore come out from among them and be separate set offsevered from themexcluded from them, said Jehovah. Do not touch the unclean thing and I will receive you. (Isaiah 52:11) (Jeremiah 51:45)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>I will be a Father to you, and you will be to me sons and daughters, said Jehovah God the Almighty. (Hosea 1:10)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness with deep reverence for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Open your hearts to us. We wronged no person. We wronged and corrupted no one. We took advantage of no person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my confidence in you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in our entire affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>When we came to Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side, fighting on the outside and fears on the inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>This is not by his coming only, but also by the comfort he brought from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me so that I rejoiced yet more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it for I see that that letter made you sorry, though but for a season,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>I now rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance; for you were made sorry after a godly fashion, that you might not suffer loss by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow works repentance leading to salvation. This is a repentance that brings no regret: but the sorrow of the world works death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>This very thing that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it made in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, yes what vindication! You demonstrated yourself to innocent in the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the one who did wrong, nor for the one who suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. We enjoyed our comfort the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his mental disposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>If in anything I have boasted about him to you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our boasting also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>His affection is even greater for you as he remembers your obedience and how with reverence and trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that in everything I am encouraged because of you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>We make known to you brothers the grace of God that has been given to the congregations of Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>Out of severe affliction they have an abundance of joy and their deep poverty abounds in the riches of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For according to their ability, I bear witness, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>They were very urgent in their concern for this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>This is not as we hoped. First they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>We exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you have plenty of everything, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love for us, see that you have plenty of this undeserved kindness also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now complete the doing. There was the eager will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>I do not say this for the ease of others and for your affliction</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent together with him the brother, whose praise in the good news has spread through all the congregations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only so, but who was also appointed by the congregations to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>Avoid this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty that is ministered by us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>for we think of honorable things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>We send our brother with them, whom we have many times proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you or our brothers, they are the messengers of the congregations, and they are the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Show to them as representatives of the congregations the quality of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>I do not need to write you about the ministry to the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>I know you are ready and I boast about to the Macedonians. That Achaia has been prepared since last year. Your zeal stirred up many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I have sent the brothers that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect. Even as I said, you may be prepared:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest by any means, if any from Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to speak of you, should be put to shame in this respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>I thought it necessary therefore to request the brothers to go before me to you, and prepare your generous gift before hand, that the same might be ready as a gift and not extortion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let each man do according as he has purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>God is able to make all grace abound toward you. You have plenty of everything you need and should abound in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>As it is written: He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor. His righteousness abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>The one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>You will be made rich in everything. And you can be generous on every occasion. This will cause thanksgiving to God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>This service not only takes care of the needs of the holy ones, but also abounds with many expressions of thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>The proof of this ministry is that they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the good news of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>They pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>The weapons we use in our fight are not of the flesh but God's powerful weapons, which we use to destroy strongholds. We destroy false arguments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>We cast down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God. We bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>We are ready to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>You look at the things that are before you. If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself that, even as he is Christ's, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>I should boast a great deal concerning the authority the Lord gave us to build you up, and not to tear you down, I would not be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong. But his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let a person like this take this into account: what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves. But they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves. They are without understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province that God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overstretching ourselves though we did not reach to you. We reached out to you with the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>We did not boast beyond our assignment in other men's labors. Having hope that, as your faith grows, we shall be made great among you according to our territory for further abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>Let us preach the good news to the parts beyond you. Let us not boast in someone elses territory in concerning things ready for our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he who boasts let him boast in Jehovah! (Jeremiah 9:24)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>It is not he that commends himself that is approved. It is the one whom Jehovah commends. (Proverbs 29:26)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I hope you can put up with me in a little foolishness: but indeed you do put up with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am zealous over you with a godly fervor ardorzeal! For I promised you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds will be lead away from the simplicity and the purity cleanness that is toward Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>If someone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you do well to put up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I do not consider myself inferior to the super apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>Though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. We have in every way made this evident to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you the good news of God without charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other congregations, taking pay from them that I might minister to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>When I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man. For the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will continue to do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me from doing this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Is it because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that in whatever matter they boast, they may be found equal with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, let no man think me foolish. If you do, yet receive me as foolish that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>You being wise tolerate the foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>You suffer, if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes advantage of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man strikes you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. If any are bold, I speak foolishly for I am also bold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more in labors more abundant, beaten beyond number, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, I suffered shipwreck three times, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>In weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Beside those things that are from the outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I do not burn with indignation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I need to boast, I will boast about the things that concern my infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed forever knows I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>The governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>So I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>I must brag, although it does not do any good. I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body, I do not know; or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows, such a one caught up even to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>I will brag about this person, but I will not brag about myself unless it is about my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>If I ever wanted to brag, I would not be a fool. Instead, I would be telling the truth. But I am going to spare you so that no one may think more of me than what he sees or hears about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>I was given a painful physical ailment that will keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw. It acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Three times I prayed to God about this and asked him to take it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>He told me: »My grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness.« Most gladly therefore, I would rather glory in my infirmities frailities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me cover me like a tentdescend upon meabide with me. (Isaiah 40:29-31)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool in boasting. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended about you: for in nothing am I inferior to the most prominent apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>What is it in which you were inferior to other congregations, except that I was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you. I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you. The children should not provide for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>I will gladly spend and be spent for you. When I love you more abundantly should I be loved less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>Just the same, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I gain you by any of them whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus gain you? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same mental disposition? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for youre up building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>I am afraid that I may come and find you different from what I want you to be, and that you may find me different from what you want me to be. I fear that there may be rivalry, jealousy, hot tempers, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence, and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication and loose conduct that they have practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This is now the third time that I am coming to visit you. The testimony of two or three witnesses must uphold an accusation. (Deuteronomy 19:15)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I told you in advance as if I were present the second time. Being absent now I write to those who have sinned and to all others. If I come again I will not spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you but is mighty in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>Though he was impaled through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. We are weak through him also, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith. Prove your own selves. Do you not know this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is with you, unless you are disqualified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we may seem disqualified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>We are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong. We also pray that you be readjusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power that the Lord gave me to enlightenment and not to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally brothers, farewell: Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the holy ones salute you.</verse>
