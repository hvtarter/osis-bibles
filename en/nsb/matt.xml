        <title>(Writer: Matthew) (Hebrew: Mattithiah, means Gift of Jehovah) (41 C.E.) (Palestine)</title>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon and Rahab were the father and mother of Boaz. Boaz and Ruth were the father and mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse the father of King David. David and Uriahs wife Bath-sheba were the father and mother of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. They lived at the time when the people were exiled to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ the Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations from the exile until the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>The birth genesis: originbeginning of Jesus Christ was as follows: His mother Mary had been promised to Joseph in marriage. But before they were married, Mary realized that she was pregnant by Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Her husband Joseph was an honorable man and did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to break the marriage agreement with her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>Joseph had this in mind when Gods angel appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him: »Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>»She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus »Jehovah is salvation« , because he will save his people from their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All this happened so that what God spoke through the prophet came true:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>»The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,« which means: »God God-like one is with us.« (John 1:18)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of God had commanded him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>He did not have marital relations with her before she gave birth to a son. Joseph named the child Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod. Astrologers arrived in Jerusalem from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>They asked: »Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and came to offer him praise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>King Herod was troubled when he heard this. Jerusalem was also troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law and asked where will the Messiah be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>»Bethlehem in Judea,« they answered. This is what the prophet wrote:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>»Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you are not the least of the leading cities of Judah. A leader will come out of you. He will shepherd my people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly called the astrologers to find out exactly the time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>He sent them to Bethlehem. He said: »Search diligently for the young child. When you find him, bring me word so I may come and bow down to him also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After they heard the king, they followed the star until it stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>They entered the house and saw the young child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and paid him homage. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>God warned the astrologers in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they departed for their country by a different road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>When they left, the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: »Herod is looking to kill the young child. Arise, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to leave.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Joseph took the child and his mother to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>They did not return until the death of Herod. The words spoken by Jehovah through the prophet were fulfilled: »I called my son out of Egypt.« (Hosea 11:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Herod saw that the astrologers tricked him and he was furious. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem. This matched the time he learned from the astrologers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Jeremiahs prophecy came true:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>»A sound was heard in Ramah, the sound of crying in bitter grief. Rachel is weeping for her children. She would not be comforted, because they were dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>After Herod died Gods angel appeared in a dream to Joseph who was in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>The angel told him: »Take the child and his mother and go to Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Joseph took the child and his mother to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>When he heard that Archelaus succeeded his father, Herod, as king of Judea, Joseph feared going. Warned in a dream, he left for Galilee instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>He made his home in Nazareth. Thus the prophecy came true: »He Jesus will be called a Nazarene.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>»Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>Isaiah spoke of John when he said: »He is a voice shouting in the wilderness: Prepare the way of Jehovah. Make his paths straight.« (Isaiah 40:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>John wore clothes made from camels hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the whole Jordan Valley went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>They confessed their sins and were baptized by John in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>He saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism. »You offspring of vipers,« he said, »who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>»Bear fruit worthy of repentance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>»Do not presume that Abraham is your father. I tell you that God can make descendants for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>»The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>»I baptize you with water because of your repentance. He that comes after me is mightier than I. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and fire. I am not even good enough to carry his sandals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>»His winnowing shovel is in his hand. He will clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into a barn. He will then burn the husks in a fire that cannot be put out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>»I need to be baptized by you,« John said. »Why are you coming to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Jesus answered emphatically: »This is the proper way to do everything that God requires. This is the way it must be!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Then Jesus was baptized and came up from the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened. He saw Gods Spirit coming down like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>Then a voice from heaven said: »This is my Son whom I love and whom I have approved.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Gods Spirit led Jesus into the desert wilderness. There he was tested tempted by the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>He fasted forty days and nights, and was very hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>Satan, the Tempter, said to him: »If since you are the Son of God order these stones to turn into bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>In reply Jesus answered: »It is written; man shall not live on bread alone, but on all everythingevery wordevery utteranceevery declaration that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.« (Deuteronomy 8:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the Devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on top of the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>»If since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. The Scriptures say: God will give orders to his angels about you and they will hold you with their hands, so that not even your feet will strike the ground.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>»Again it is written,« Jesus replied, »you must not put Jehovah your God to the test.« (Deuteronomy 6:16)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>This time the Devil took Jesus to an extremely high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world with all their greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>»I will give all this to you,« the Devil told Jesus, »if you kneel down and worship me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>»Go away, Satan!« demanded Jesus. »It is written, »It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.« (Deuteronomy 6:13-15)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the Devil left Jesus, and the angels came and served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Jesus heard that John had been arrested. So Jesus withdrew to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>He left Nazareth to reside at Capernaum, a town by Lake Galilee, in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>Thus the prophecy revealed to Isaiah would be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>»O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>»the people sitting in darkness saw a great light. Light rose upon those sitting in a region of deathly shadow.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time on Jesus preached this message: »Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Jesus walked on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. They were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>He said to them: »Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>At once they abandoned their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>He saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>Instantly they left the boat and their father, and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus walked all over Galilee teaching in the synagogues. He preached the Good News about the Kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>News about him spread throughout the country of Syria. People sick and suffering from diseases, people with demons, epileptics and paralytics, came to him. Jesus healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Because of this, large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the land on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing great masses of people, he went up to the mountain. When he was seated his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>He opened his mouth and taught them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>»Blessed Greek: makarios: happy, blessed are those conscious of their spiritual need, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>»Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>»Blessed are the meek gentlemildhumble, for they will inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>»Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>»Blessed are the merciful and compassionate, for they will receive mercy and compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>»Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>»Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>»Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>»Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>»Rejoice, and be filled with joy, for great is your reward in heaven. The prophets, who came before you, were also persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>»You are the salt of the earth. If its taste goes away, how will you restore it? It is good for nothing. All you can do is throw it on the ground and walk on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>»You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill may be seen by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>»A light is not placed under a cover. To the contrary, it is placed on a table so all may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>»Likewise, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>»Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill perfectexecuteaccomplish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>»I solemnly tell you, heaven and earth would pass away before one small letter detail will pass away from the Law. All things must be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>»Whoever disobeys even the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. On the other hand whoever obeys and teaches others to obey the Law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>»I also tell you, your righteousness must be greater than the scribes and Pharisees or you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>»You were told in the past, do not murder kill. Any one who murders will be brought to trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>»Now I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court. Whoever speaks to his brother with words of contempt shall receive condemnation before the Sanhedrin Supreme Court. Curse your brother and you will be guilty enough to be destroyed by fire, with the burning trash, at the Valley of Hinnom, outside of Jerusalem Greek: Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>»When making an offering at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>»leave your gift at the altar and go make peace with your brother. Then return and make your offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>»Come to an agreement quickly with the one who has a legal case against you. Do it before he turns the case over to the judge and you are thrown into jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>»Take it from me; you will stay in jail until you pay the very last penny of your fine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>»You have heard it was said, You should not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>»However, I tell you that whoever looks at a woman with lustful thoughts commits adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>»If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away! It is better to lose a part of your body then to have your whole body destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>»If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose part of your body, than for your whole body to be destroyed in the ever-burning fire. Figuratively: lose prospect for everlasting life; ever-burning fire means total destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>»Again, it was said, Whoever gets rid of his wife has to give her a certificate of divorce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>»I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for the reason of fornication, makes her liable to commit adultery. And if she marries again, the man she marries also commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>»You were also told that you should keep a promise oath. Always keep your promises vows to Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>»Let your answer be Yes or No. Anything more than this is from the evil one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>»But I tell you, do not resist a wicked person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to that person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>»If someone takes you to court to sue you and takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>He reached out his hand and touched him, saying: »I want to. Be made clean.« Right away his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Jesus told him not to tell anyone. »Show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>When he entered Capernaum, a centurion captain of one hundred men approached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>He said: »Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home and terribly tormented.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus said to him: »I will come and heal him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion replied to Jesus: »Lord, I am not worthy that you come under my roof. Say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>»I also am a man having authority and commanding soldiers. I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to the crowd: »I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>»I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Jesus said to the centurion: »Go. Just as you believe, so it will be done to you.« The servant was healed in that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Jesus went to Peters house. He saw his wifes mother lying sick of a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>He touched her hand and the fever left her. She arose, and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>That evening, they brought many people possessed with demons to him. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>In so doing, that which was spoken through Isaiah was fulfilled. Isaiah wrote: »He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Now when Jesus saw how large the crowd was growing, he gave orders to depart to the other side of the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>A scribe came to him and said: »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus replied: »Foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>One of his disciples said: »Lord, first allow me to go bury my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him: »Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>When he entered a boat, his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>Suddenly a storm blew in and the boat was covered with waves. Jesus was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And they came to him, woke him, and cried: »Save us, Lord, or we will perish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>He said to them: »Why are you afraid, you of little faith?« Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Suddenly there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>The disciples were in awe. They asked: »What kind of man is this, for even the winds and the sea obey him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>When he arrived at the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes two men possessed by demons came to him from out of the tombs. They were extremely violent, so no man could pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>They screamed at him, saying: »What have we to do with you, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the time?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>A large herd of swine was feeding in the distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>The demons pleaded with him: »If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>He told them to go. And they came out, and went into the swine. The entire herd rushed down the hill into the sea, where they perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>The herdsmen fled to the city to tell everything that happened to the swine that were possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>Everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged him to go away from their country.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Jesus entered a boat and crossed over to his own city Capernaum, on the other side of the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>A man on a bed, a paralytic, was brought to Jesus. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the sick man: »Have courage; your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>Some of the scribes said among themselves: »This man has no respect for God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said: »Why are your thoughts evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>»Which is easier, to say, your sins are forgiven, or to say, get up and walk?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>So that you know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he turned and spoke to the paralytic or paralyzed man: »Get up, take your bed and go to your house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>He arose, and departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>But when the people saw it, they marveled, and glorified God who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>Jesus moved on. He then saw Matthew seated at his work collecting taxes. He said to him: »Follow me.« He rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Jesus was a dinner guest at Matthews house. Many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>When the Pharisees saw it, they asked his disciples: »Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>When he heard it, he said: »People who are well do not have need of a physician. The sick do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>»You should learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; for I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>The disciples of John asked: »Why do your disciples not fast?« They frequently fasted, and so did the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus replied: »Should the wedding guests mourn and also celebrate with the groom? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>»Why patch an old garment with cloth that has not been shrunk? The patch shrinks and pulls away from the old cloth leaving a big hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>»Neither do men put new wine in old wineskins. The skins burst and the wine is lost. They put new wine in fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While he was speaking, an official came and paid him respect. He said: »By now my daughter must be dead. Come and lay your hand on her and she will live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>A woman who had a hemorrhage chronic flow of blood for twelve years came behind him. She touched the border of his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>She said to herself: »If I touch his garment, I will be healed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turned to see her and said: »Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.« The woman was healed at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>Jesus went into the officials house and saw flute players and the crowd making a lot of noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He told them to leave: »For the girl is not dead, but sleeps.« They all scornfully laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>The people were sent away. He went to the girl, took hold of her hand, and she got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>The news about this spread to all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>Jesus left that place and walked along the road. Two blind men followed him. They shouted: »Have mercy on us, Son of David!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>He went into a nearby house. The blind men followed him. Jesus asked them: »Do you believe that I can heal you?« They said: »Yes Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>He touched their eyes. »Let it be done,« he said, »according to your faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly warned them: »Do not let anyone know about this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>They spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>Next, a dumb man possessed with a demon was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>When the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd marveled, saying: »We have never seen anything like this in Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>The Pharisees complained: »He casts out demons with the help of the ruler of the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Jesus went to all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom. He healed every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>When he saw the large crowds of people, he was moved with compassion for them. He knew they were distressed and scattered like sheep not having a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Jesus said to his disciples: »The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>When Jesus finished speaking, he departed from Galilee. He went to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>Large crowds followed him, and he healed many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>Pharisees came to him. They tested him, asking: »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>He answered: »Have you not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>»For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>»So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has joined together, let no man pull apart separate!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They asked him: »Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, to send her away?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>He answered: »Moses allowed you to send your wives away because of your hardness of heart. It was not allowed from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>»I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. And he who marries her when she is divorced, commits adultery.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>The disciples said to him: »This being the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>He said: »This does not apply to everyone, only to those God has given it to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>»For there are men who, from birth, were without sex. There are some who were made that way by men. There are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this let him accept it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then some people brought little children to him. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples tried to stop them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>Jesus said: »Let the little ones children come to me. Do not keep them away: for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>He put his hands on them, and then went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>One man said: »Master, what good thing must I do, so that I may have eternal life?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>Jesus answered him: »Why are you questioning me about what is good? There is one who is good. If you desire life, obey the Law.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>The man replied: »Which law?« And Jesus said: »Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false witness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>»Honor your father and your mother, and Love your neighbor as yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The man said to him: »I have done all these things; what more is there?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus then replied: »If you wish to be complete, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor. You will have wealth in heaven. Then follow me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>But hearing these words, the young man went away grieving, for he was very wealthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Jesus said to his disciples: »Truly I tell you, it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>»Again I say, It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>The disciples were greatly surprised when they heard this. »Who, then, may have salvation?« they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus looked at them and said: »With men this is not possible. All things are possible with God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter said: »See, we have given up everything to follow you. What then will we have?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus replied: »Truly I say to you, when all things are made new, and the Son of man is seated in his glory, you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>»Everyone who has given up houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or child, or land, for my name, will receive many times as much, and have everlasting life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>They were near Jerusalem at Bethphage. Jesus sent two disciples to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>He told them, »Go to the nearby town and look for a donkey with a cord around her neck. There will be a young one with her. Turn them loose and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>»Tell anyone who asks, The Lord needs them, and right away he will allow them to go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>This took place so that the words of the prophet might come true:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>»Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your King comes to you, humble, and seated on a donkey, a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>So the disciples did as Jesus commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>They got the donkey and the young one, and laid their clothing on them. And he sat on the clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Most of the people spread their garments on the road. Others took branches from the trees and put them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>Those going ahead of him and following him shouted praise: »Glory to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah! Glory in the highest!« (Psalms 118:26)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When he came to Jerusalem, the people were excited. They asked: »Who is this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>Other people said: »This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all who were trading there. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those trading in doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>He told them: »It is written, My house is to be named a house of prayer, but you are making it a hiding place of thieves.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>The blind and the crippled came to him in the Temple, and he made them well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>The chief priests and the scribes saw the powerful works he did. They heard the children crying out in the Temple: »Glory to the son of David.« This made them very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>»Have you any idea what these people are saying?« Jesus answered: »Yes. It is written, From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>He left them and went out of the town to Bethany where he stayed for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>He was hungry in the morning when he returned to the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>He saw a fig tree along the side of the road. He went to it and saw nothing on it but leaves. He told it: »You will not bare fruit from this time forward, forever.« Immediately the fig tree became dry and dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>The disciples were surprised when they saw it. They asked how the fig tree became dry so quickly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus answered: »If you have faith and do not doubt, I make this promise to you: You will be able to do what was done to this fig tree. When you say to this mountain, be moved into the sea, it will be done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>When he went into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching. They asked: »By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answered: »I will ask you one question. If you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>»Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven or from men?« They talked among themselves. »If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not have faith in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>»But if we say, From men, we must fear the people, because they all recognize John to be a prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>Therefore they answered: »We have no idea.« He replied to them: »Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>»What do you think? A man had two sons. He asked the first to work today in the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>»The first son said in answer, I will not. Later he changed his mind and went to work.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>»Which of the two pleased his father?« They replied: »The first.« Jesus said to them: »I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will go into the kingdom of God before you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>»John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him. Even the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. When you saw this, you did not regret your sins and did not have faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>»Listen to another illustration. A master of a house made a vineyard, and put a wall around it. He made a wine press and built a tower. Then he rented it to workers and traveled to another country.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said to them: »Have you read the Scriptures, The stone the builders rejected has been made the chief cornerstone of the building. This was Jehovahs doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes. (Isaiah 28:16)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>»I tell you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>After they sang a song of praise to God, they went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Jesus said to them: »All of you will fall away because of me tonight. It is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>»When I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered: »Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said: »I say to you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter protested: »Even if I must die for you, I would not deny you!« His disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Jesus went with them to Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He was sorrowful and very troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>He told them: »My heart is deeply grieved to the point of death. Stay with me and watch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Then he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed: »My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>When he came to the disciples, they were sleeping. He said to Peter: »Could you not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>»Watch and pray continually that you do not enter into temptation!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>A second time he went away and prayed, saying: »Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>He returned to find them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>He went away to pray a third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>After returning to the disciples, he said: »Do you sleep now and take your rest? The hour is here and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>»Arise, let us go; the man who betrays me is here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>As he spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, followed by a crowd carrying swords and spears, approached him. The chief priest and elders of the people had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>He that betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them: »The one I kiss is he. Take him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>He went directly to Jesus and said: »Hail, Rabbi,« and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus told him: »Do that for which you came.« They laid hands on Jesus, and captured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Look, one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Jesus told him: »Put your sword in its place. Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>»Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help? He would send me more than twelve legions of angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>»How then will the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>That very hour Jesus said to the people, »Have you come out to take me with swords and sticks as if I were a thief? You did not take me when I taught in the Temple daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>»This has taken place so that the writings of the prophets will come true.« Then all his disciples left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Those who captured Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and those in authority also gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter kept his distance. He followed him to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the servants, to see the outcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>They failed, even though a number of false witnesses came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>Later two witnesses came. They said: »This man said, I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The high priest stood up and said to him: »Have you no answer? What is it these say against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>Jesus said nothing. The high priest said to him: »I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him: »You said it yourself. And I say to you, after this you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest ripped his robes apart and said: »He has said evil against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his words of blasphemy!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>»What is your opinion?« The crowd answered: »Put him to death!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>They spat in his face and hit him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>»Prophesy to us, you Christ; tell us who hit you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Peter was seated in the square outside the house, and a servant-girl came to him. She said: »You were with Jesus the Galilean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>In front of everybody, he replied: »I do not know what you are talking about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>When he reached the gate, another saw him and said: »This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Again he denied with an oath: »I have no knowledge of the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>A few moments later, those who were near approached and said to Peter: »Indeed, you are one of them, because the way you speak gives you away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then with curses and oaths he said: »I do not know the man!« And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Peter remembered what Jesus told him: »Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.« He went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>It was morning. The chief priests and those in authority conspired to put Jesus to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>They tied his hands with cords and led him to the ruler, Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Judas, his betrayer, heard he was to be put to death. Out of regret, he took the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and those in authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>He said: »I have done wrong in giving a righteous man to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>He left the silver in the Temple. Then he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the silver. They said: »It is not right to put it in the Temple treasury, for it is the price of blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>They decided to use the silver to buy the potters field. This would be a place to bury strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>This is the reason the field was named »Field of Blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then Jeremiahs prophecy was fulfilled: »They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price he was valued by the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>»Then they paid for the potters field, just as God directed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Jesus stood before the governor. He asked him: »Are you the King of the Jews?« Jesus said to him: »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>When the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Pilate said to him: »Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>Jesus did not answer. Not even a word! The governor was greatly surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>It was a custom for the governor to set one prisoner free at the time of the feast. The people were to help choose that prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>At that time they held an important prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>When they assembled, Pilate asked: »What is your choice? Barabbas or Jesus, the one called the Christ?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>He knew it was because of envy they gave him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was seated in judgment his wife sent a message to him. She said, »Do not judge that righteous man. I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>The chief priests and elders got the people to request Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor responded to them. He asked: »Which of the two do you want me to set free?« They shouted: »Barabbas!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them: »What am I to do with Jesus, the one called Christ?« They all said: »Put him to death. Impale him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>»What evil has he done?« Pilate asked. But they shouted: »Impale him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Pilate saw that he could do nothing. The people were ready to cause much trouble. He took water and washed his hands in front of the people. He said: »The blood of this man is not on my hands. You are responsible.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>The people answered: »Let his blood be on us, and on our children.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>He set Barabbas free. He had Jesus whipped. Then he commanded that he be put to death on the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the palace guard took Jesus into the open square and gathered their squad together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They placed a rod in his right hand. Then they bowed down on their knees before him. They mocked him, saying: »Long life to the King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spat on him and hit him on the head with the rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>After they mocked him, they took off the robe. He was dressed in his garments and he was led away to be impaled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>They then found Simon, a man from Cyrene. They forced him to go with them to carry the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>Golgotha, the Place of the Skull, was to be his final destination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They gave him vinegar bitter wine to drink mixed with poison a druggall. When he tasted it he would not drink. (Psalm 69:21)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>When they impaled him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then they sat and watched him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>A sign was placed above his head with an accusation written: »This is Jesus the King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Two robbers were impaled with him. One was on the right hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>People passing by spoke evil abuse to him. They wagged their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and said, »You who would destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God come down from the stake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In like manner the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>They said: »He saved others, but cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the stake and we will believe in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God. Let him save him now if he wants him. After all he said: »I am the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The robbers that were impaled with him also insulted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« Which translated means: »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>After hearing it some said this man calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Suddenly, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said: »Let it be, and see whether Elijah comes to save him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>The veil curtain of the temple was ripped in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>The tombs were split open and many dead bodies were tossed upright on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>They came out of the tombs after his resurrection.Manuscript text unclear. Many people saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>The centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake. Filled with much fear of the things that were done, they proclaimed: »Truly, this was the Son of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>The women who followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him watched from a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Included among the women were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>A disciple of Jesus named Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>He laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene was near the tomb. The other Mary was also there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>It was morning, the day after Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>They said: »Sir, we remember while he was yet alive, the deceiver said, After three days I will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>»Command the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise his disciples could come and steal him away. They could say to the people. He is risen from the dead. The last deception will be worse than the first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them: »You have a guard; make it as secure as you can.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they made the tomb secure. They sealed the stone and placed a guard there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, as an angel of God descended from heaven and rolled away the stone and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>The guards shook with fear and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel spoke to the women: »I know you seek Jesus who has been impaled; do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>»He is not here, for he has risen just as he promised. Come; see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>»Go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead. See, he goes before you to Galilee. You will see him there, as I have told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>They departed quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy. They ran to bring his disciples the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached and took hold of his feet and kissed them in adoration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus told them: »Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to travel to Galilee. I will see them there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While they were going, some of the guard came into the city. They told the chief priests all the things that happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>They took counsel with the elders. Then they bribed the soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>The soldiers were instructed to say: »His disciples came at night and stole him while we slept.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>»If the governor hears about this, we will persuade him so you may be free from worry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus specified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they bowed down in adoration for him. But some doubted were lacking faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying: »All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>»Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>»Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«</verse>
