      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (60-61 C.E.) (Rome)</title>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the congregation in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>I hear about your love, and about the faith you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>May the fellowship of your faith operate in the knowledge of every good thing that is in you for Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>I have all boldness in Christ to tell you what is appropriate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Because of love I appeal to you, since I am Paul, the aged. I am also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>He was once worthless to you, but now is useful to you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I send him back to you, like sending my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I would have kept him with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>Without your agreement I would do nothing. Your goodness should not be out of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps he was separated from you for a season, that you should have him forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>He is no longer a servant. He is more than a servant. He is a beloved brother, especially to me, but also to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he has wronged you and owes you anything at all, charge this to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul write with my own hand. I will repay. I do not say that you owe your own self life to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have joy in you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>I have confidence in your obedience. I write you, knowing that you will do beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Prepare a lodging for me. I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit mental dispositionattitude. Amen.</verse>
