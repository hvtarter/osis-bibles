        <title>(Writer: John) (98 C.E.) (Ephesus)</title>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love. That righteous man that dwelled among them was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in good health. May you prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and witnessed about the truth that is in you and that you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you do for the brothers and strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>They testify about your love seen by the congregation. You do well to send them forward on their journey worthily of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the people of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We ought to receive and welcome such ones, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote something to the congregation. But Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>If I come, I will remind you of what he does. He unjustly accuses us with wicked words and is never satisfied. He does not allow the brothers to greet one another and he throws them out of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is from God. He who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has the witness of all men, and of the truth itself. Yes, we also testify and you know our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write them to you with ink and pen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>I hope to see you shortly. We shall speak face to face. Peace to you! The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
