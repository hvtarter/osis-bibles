      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <title>(Writer Samuel) (1100 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying: »Who will go first to fight against the Canaanites for us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>Jehovah said: »Judah will go up. I have delivered the land into his hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>Judah said to Simeon his brother: »Come up with me to my allotted territory that we may fight against the Canaanites. I likewise will go with you to your territory.« So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>Judah went up and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They killed ten thousand men at Bezek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him. They killed the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>Adoni-bezek fled and they chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-bezek said: »Seventy kings with their big toes cut off have gathered food scrapes under my table. God has repaid me for what I have done.« So they brought him to Jerusalem where he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that lived in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>Judah went against the Canaanites that lived in Hebron previously called Kirjath-arba and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>From there they advanced against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>Caleb said: »He that attacks Kirjath-sepher, and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>When she came to him she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey Caleb said to her: »What do you wish?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>She said: »Give me a blessing: for you have given me a land south with spring water.« And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>The children of the Kenite, Moses father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah to the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad to live with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they attacked the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Judah took Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory as well as Ekron with its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>Jehovah was with Judah. He drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised and he expelled the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem. The Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel: and Jehovah was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>The house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>The spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him: »Show us the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>When he showed them the entrance into the city, they struck the city with the edge of the sword. But spared the man and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city. He called it Luz, which is its name this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites wanted to live in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>When Israel was strong they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor. They did not completely drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that lived in Gezer. But the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became forced laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced laborers to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain. They would not allow them to come down to the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became forced laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>The boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>An angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: »I led you out of Egypt and brought you to the land about which I swore to your fathers that I would never break my covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>»You will make no covenant with people of this land. You will throw down their altars. You have not obeyed my voice. Why have you done this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>»I also said: I will not drive them out from before you. They will be thorns in your sides. Their gods will snare trap you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>When the angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel the people wept loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>They called that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>When Joshua let the people go the children of Israel went, every man, to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>The people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works Jehovah did for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>They buried him on the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of Gaash hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>After those generations were gathered to their fathers died another generation followed them. This new generation did not know Jehovah or the works he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>The children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served Baalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>They forsook Jehovah God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them. They bowed to them and provoked Jehovah to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel. He delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil. For Jehovah had sworn to them and as Jehovah had sworn they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Nevertheless Jehovah established judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>Yet they would not listen to their judges, but prostituted themselves to other gods. They worshiped them. They turned quickly, out of the way in which their fathers walked obeying the commandments of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>When Jehovah established judges he supported each judge. He delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days the judge lived. He had compassion for them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>When the judge was dead they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers. They followed other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel. He said: »Because this people have transgressed my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>»I will not drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>»That through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of Jehovah and walk in it as their fathers did.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out. He did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations that Jehovah left to test the Israelites who had not known all the wars of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>He did this to teach warfare to the generations of the children of Israel who had not had previous battle experience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>Those left in the land were the five Philistine cities, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Hamath Pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>They were to be a test for Israel. This would find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commandments that Jehovah gave their ancestors through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>The people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>The people of Israel forgot Jehovah their God. They sinned against him and worshiped the idols of Baal and Asherah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Jehovah became angry at Israel and let King Cushan Rishathaim of Mesopotamia conquer them. They were subject to him for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>The Israelites cried out to Jehovah, and he sent someone to free them. This was Othniel, the son of Calebs younger brother Kenaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>The Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he became Israels leader judge. Othniel went to war, and Jehovah gave him the victory over the king of Mesopotamia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>There was peace in the land for forty years until Othniel died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>The people of Israel sinned against Jehovah again. Because of this Jehovah made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites. They defeated Israel and captured Jericho, the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>Then the Israelites cried out to Jehovah. So he sent someone to free them. This was Ehud, a left-handed man, who was the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. The people of Israel sent Ehud to King Eglon of Moab with gifts for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>Ehud made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long. He fastened it on his right side under his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>He took the gifts to Eglon, who was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>When Ehud gave him the gifts, he told the men who carried them to go back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But Ehud turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal, went back to Eglon, and said: »Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.« So the king ordered his servants: »Leave us alone!« Then they all went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>The king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof. Ehud went over to him and said: »I have a message from God for you.« The king stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the kings belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>The whole sword went in, handle and all, and the fat covered it up. Ehud did not pull it out of the kings belly, and it stuck out behind, between his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Ehud went outside, closed the doors behind him, locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>Then he left. The servants came and saw that the doors to the upstairs room were locked. They only thought that the king was inside, relieving himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>They waited as long as they thought they should. When he still did not open the door, they took the key and opened it. There lying dead on the floor was their master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>Ehud got away while they were waiting. He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim, he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle. Then he led them down from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>He said to them: »Follow me! Jehovah has given you victory over your enemies, the Moabites.« So they followed Ehud and captured the place where the Moabites were to cross the Jordan. They did not allow anyone to cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>They killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers. None of them escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>That day the Israelites defeated Moab. There was peace in the land for eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath. He too rescued Israel, and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>After Ehud died, the people of Israel sinned against Jehovah again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>Jehovah let them be conquered by Jabin, a Canaanite king who ruled in the city of Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived at Harosheth-Hagoyim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots, and he ruled the people of Israel with cruelty and violence for twenty years. The people of Israel cried out to Jehovah for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet, and she was serving as a judge for the Israelites at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>She held court under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The children of Israel came to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>She sent for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him: »Has Jehovah the God of Israel commanded, saying: Go and deploy troops at mount Tabor. Take ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>»And I will lure Sisera, the captain of Jabins army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>Barak said to her: »If you will go with me, then I will go. If you will not go with me I will not go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>She said: »I will surely go with you. Never the less there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking. For Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.« Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men under his command. Deborah went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent at the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>They showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>Sisera gathered together all his nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the nations to the Kishon River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>Deborah said to Barak: »Get up, for this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand. Jehovah has gone out before you.« So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>Jehovah routed Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera dismounted his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army to Harosheth-Hagoyim. All of Siseras army fell by the edge of the sword. Not one person was left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite. There was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him: »Come my lord, come right in. Do not be afraid.« When he came in to her tent, she covered him with a mantle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>He said to her: »Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty.« She opened a jug of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>Again he said: »Stand at the door of the tent. When any man comes to inquire and asks: Is there a man here? Say: »No.« «</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael Hebers wife picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went to him while he was fast asleep and drove the peg into his temple and it went down into the ground. He was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>Barak pursued Sisera and Jael came out to meet him. She said to him: »Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.« He went to her tend and saw Sisera lay dead with the peg in his temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>The children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>That day Deborah and Barak sang this song:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>»Praise Jehovah! The Israelites were determined to fight. The people gladly volunteered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>»Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you rulers! I will sing and play music to Israels God, Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.4'>»Jehovah, when you left the mountains of Seir, when you came out of Edom, the earth shook, and rain fell from the sky. Yes, water poured out of the clouds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.5'>»The mountains shook before Jehovah of Sinai, before Jehovah, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.6'>»In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted. Travelers used the back roads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.7'>»The towns of Israel were abandoned. They stood empty until I Deborah came, came like a mother for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.8'>»There was war in the land when the Israelites chose new gods. Of the forty thousand men in Israel, did anyone carry shield or spear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.9'>»My heart is with the commanders of Israel, with the people who gladly volunteered. Praise Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.10'>»Speak of it, you who ride on white donkeys, sitting on saddles. You that must walk wherever you go.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.6'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>Again the people of Israel sinned against Jehovah. Therefore he let the people of Midian rule them for seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>The Midianites were very oppressive over Israel. So much so that the people of Israel hid from them in caves and other safe places in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>When the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites along with the desert tribes attacked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>They camped on the land and destroyed the crops as far south as Gaza. They took all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, and left nothing for the Israelites to live on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.5'>They came with their livestock and tents, as thick as locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels. They entered the land and destroyed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>Israel was helpless against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>The people of Israel cried out to Jehovah for help against the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>Then Jehovah sent a man, a prophet, to the Israelites. He said to them: »Jehovah, the God of Israel says, It was I who brought you out of slavery in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.9'>»I rescued you from the Egyptians and from the people who fought you in this land. I drove them out as you advanced. I gave you their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.10'>»I said to you: I am Jehovah your God. You should not worship the gods of the Amorites, whose land you are now living in. But you have not listened to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>The angel of Jehovah came to the village of Ophrah. He sat under the oak tree that belonged to Joash, a man of the clan of Abiezer. His son Gideon was secretly threshing wheat in a wine press, so that the Midianites would not see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>Jehovahs angel appeared to him there and said: »Jehovah is with you, mighty man of valor!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>Gideon said to him: »May I ask, sir, why has all this happened to us if Jehovah is with us? What happened to all the wonderful things that our fathers told us Jehovah used to do, how he brought them out of Egypt? Jehovah has abandoned us. He left us to the mercy of the Midianites.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>Jehovah answered him: »Go in the strength you have and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>Gideon replied: »But Jehovah, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh. I am the least important member of my family.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.16'>Jehovah answered: »You can do it. I will help you. You will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.17'>Gideon replied: »If you are pleased with me, give me proof that you are really Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.18'>»Please do not leave until I return and bring you an offering.« Jehovah said: »I will stay until you come back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>So Gideon went into his house and cooked a young goat and used a bushel of flour to make bread without any yeast. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, brought them to Jehovahs angel under the oak tree, and gave them to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>The angel told him: »Put the meat and the bread on this rock, and pour the broth over them.« Gideon did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Jehovahs angel reached out and touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick he was holding. Fire came out of the rock and burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel disappeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>With that Gideon realized that it was Jehovahs angel he saw. He said in terror: »Sovereign Lord Jehovah! I have seen your angel face-to-face!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>Jehovah told him: »Peace. Do not be afraid. You will not die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>Gideon built an altar to Jehovah there and named it: »Jehovah is Peace.« Jehovah-shalom It is still standing at Ophrah and belongs to the clan of Abiezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>That night Jehovah told Gideon: »Take your fathers bull and another seven year old bull, tear down your fathers altar to Baal, and cut down the symbol of the goddess Asherah, that is beside it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>»Build a well-constructed altar to Jehovah your God on top of this mound. Take the second bull and burn it as a whole offering. Cut down the symbol of Asherah and use it for firewood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what Jehovah instructed him to do. He was afraid of his family and the people in town, so he did it at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>The people in town got up early the next morning. They found that the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah had been cut down. The second bull had been burned on the altar that was built there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>They asked each other: »Who did this?« They investigated and found out that Gideon, son of Joash, did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>They said to Joash: »Bring your son here. We will kill him!« He tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the symbol of Asherah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>Joash replied: »Are you arguing for Baal? Are you defending him? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning. If Baal really is a god he can defend himself. It is his altar that was torn down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>From then on Gideon was known as Jerubbaal, because Joash said: »Let Baal defend himself for his altar was torn down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>The Midianites, Amalekites, and the desert tribes assembled, crossed the Jordan River, and camped in Jezreel Valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>The Spirit of Jehovah took control of Gideon. He blew a trumpet to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh to call them to follow him. He sent messengers to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they also came to join him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>Gideon said to God: »You have said you will rescue Israel using me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>»Look I will place wool on the threshing floor where we thresh the wheat. If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground, I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>That is what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>Then Gideon said to God: »Do not be angry with me. Allow me to speak just once more. Please let me make one more test with the wool. This time let the wool be dry, and the ground wet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>That night God did it. The next morning the wool was dry, but the ground was wet with dew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring. The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>Jehovah said to Gideon: »The men you have are too many for me to give them victory over the Midianites. They might think that they had won by themselves and not give me credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>»Announce to the people: Anyone who is afraid should go back home. We will stay here at Mount Gilead. Twenty-two thousand went back, but ten thousand stayed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>Jehovah said to Gideon: »You still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will separate them for you. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>Gideon took the men to the water. Jehovah told him: »Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue like a dog, from everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it. The others got down on their knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>Jehovah said: »I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites. Use the three hundred men who lapped the water. Tell everyone else to go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>Gideon sent the Israelites home, except the three hundred. They kept all the supplies and trumpets. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>That night Jehovah commanded Gideon: »Get up and attack the camp. I give you victory over it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>»If you are afraid to attack, go to the camp with your servant Purah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>»You will hear what they are saying, and then you will have the courage to attack.« Gideon and his servant Purah went to the edge of the enemy camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts. They had so many camels they could not be counted. They were as plentiful as there are grains of sand on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling a friend about a dream. He was saying: »I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent. The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>His friend responded: »This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash. For God delivered Midian and its army to this man of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel, and called out: »Arise! Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>He divided the three hundred men into three companies. He put a trumpet in every mans hand, with empty jars, and lamps within the jars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>He said to them: »Look at me, and do as I do. When I come to the outside of the camp do the same as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>»When I blow the trumpet, all who are with me should blow the trumpets. Blow the trumpets on every side of the camp and say: The sword of Jehovah, and of Gideon!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>Gideon and the hundred men, who were with him, came to the outside of the camp. It was the beginning of the middle watch and they had just posted the new watch. They blew the trumpets, and broke the jars that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the jars, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands. Then they cried: »The sword of Jehovah, and of Gideon!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>Every man stood in his place around the camp. The army ran, and cried, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>The three hundred blew the trumpets. Jehovah set every mans sword against his companions. They turned on each other throughout all the army. The army fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>The men of Israel gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say: »Come down and fight the Midianites! Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah, to keep the Midianites from crossing them.« The men of Ephraim were called together, and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock, and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>Then the people of Ephraim said to Gideon: »Why did you not call us when you went to fight the Midianites? Why did you treat us like this?« They complained bitterly about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>He said: »What have I accomplished compared to you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>»God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, to you. What was I able to do in comparison to you?« Then their anger toward him subsided at what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.4'>Gideon and his three hundred men passed over the Jordan. Their pursuit continued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.5'>He said to the men of Succoth: »Give my troops some bread. They are tired. I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.6'>The princes of Succoth said: »Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.7'>Gideon said: »When Jehovah delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>He went up to Penuel and made the same request of them. The men of Penuel gave the same answer as the men of Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>He spoke to the men of Penuel: »When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor. Their armies were with them, about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the armies of the children of the east. They had already lost a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.11'>Gideon went up by the way of the nomads who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah. They attacked the army while the camp felt secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.12'>When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured them and routed the entire army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.13'>Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun came up at Heres Pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.14'>He captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He described the princes of Succoth, and the elders and even seventy-seven men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.15'>Then Gideon went to the men of Sukkoth and said: »Remember when you refused to help me? You said that you could not give any food to my exhausted army because I had not captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet. Well, here they are!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>Then he took the elders of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.17'>He tore down the tower at Penuel. He also killed the men of that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.18'>Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna: »What kind of men were the men you killed at Tabor?« They answered: »They looked like you, every one of them like the son of a king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.19'>He said: »They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Jehovah lives, if you had saved them alive, I will not kill you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.20'>He said to Jether his firstborn: »Rise up and kill them.« But the youth would not draw his sword. He was afraid because he was still a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.21'>Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon: »Kill us yourself. It takes a man to do this job.« Gideon killed them and took the ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.22'>The Israelites said to Gideon: »Be our ruler, you and your descendants after you. You saved us from the Midianites.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.23'>Gideon answered: »I will not be your ruler, nor will my son. Jehovah will be your ruler!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.24'>He also said: »Let me ask one thing of you. Every one of you must give me the earrings you took.« The Midianites wore gold earrings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.25'>They answered: »We will gladly give them to you.« They spread out a cloth, and everyone put the earrings that he had taken on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.26'>The gold earrings that Gideon got weighed over forty pounds. This did not include the ornaments, necklaces, and purple clothes that the kings of Midian wore. It also did not include the collars that were around the necks of their camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.27'>Gideon made an idol from the gold and placed it in his hometown, Ophrah. The Israelites abandoned God and went there to worship the idol. It was a trap for Gideon and his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.28'>Midian was defeated by the Israelites and was no longer a threat. The land was at peace for forty years, until Gideon died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.29'>Gideon went back to his home and lived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.30'>He had many wives and seventy sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.31'>He also kept a concubine in Shechem. She bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.32'>Gideon son of Joash died at an old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, at Ophrah. Ophrah was the town of the clan of Abiezer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.14.3'>His father and mother asked him: »Why do you go to those heathen Philistines to get a wife? Can you not find someone in our own family or among all our people?« Samson told his father: »I like her! She is the one I want. Get her for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>His parents did not know Jehovah was leading Samson to do this. Jehovah was looking for an opportunity to fight the Philistines. At this time the Philistines were ruling Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.5'>Samson went to Timnah with his father and mother. When they traveled through the vineyards he heard a young lion roaring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.6'>Suddenly the power of Jehovah made Samson strong. He tore the lion apart with his bare hands, as if it were a young goat. But he did not tell his parents what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.7'>Then he went and talked to the young woman. He wanted her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.8'>A few days later Samson returned to marry her. On the way he left the road to look at the lion he had killed. He found a swarm of bees and some honey inside the dead body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.9'>He scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. Then he went to his father and mother and gave them some. They ate it, but Samson did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the dead body of a lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.10'>Samsons father went to the womans house. Samson gave a banquet there. This was a custom among the young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.11'>The Philistines saw him. They sent thirty companions to stay with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.12'>Samson said to them: »Let me tell you a riddle. If you can tell me the meaning before the seven days of the wedding feast are over, I will give each of you a piece of fine linen and a change of fine clothes.« »Tell us your riddle,« they said: »Let us hear it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.13'>»If you cannot tell me the answer you must give me thirty pieces of fine linen and thirty sets of fine clothes.« »Tell us the riddle,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.14'>He said: »Out of the eater came something to eat; Out of the strong came something sweet.« Three days later they still could not figure out the riddle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.15'>On the fourth day they said to Samsons wife: »Trick your husband into telling us what the riddle means. If you do not, we will burn your fathers house with you in it. Did you invite us here to rob us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.16'>Samsons wife approached him in tears and said: »You do not love me! You just hate me! You told my friends a riddle and did not tell me its meaning!« He said: »I have not told my father and mother. Why should I tell you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.17'>She cried about it for the whole seven days of the feast. She nagged him so that on the seventh day he told her what the riddle meant. Then she told the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.18'>On the seventh day, before Samson went into the bedroom, the men of the city said to him: »What could be sweeter than honey? What could be stronger than a lion?« Samson replied: »If you had not been plowing with my cow, you would not know the answer now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.19'>Suddenly the power of Jehovah made him strong. He went to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty men. He stripped them and gave their fine clothes to the men who had solved the riddle. He returned home, furious about what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.14.20'>His wife was given to his best man at the wedding.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.15'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.1'>Later Samson went to visit his wife during the wheat harvest and took her a young goat. He told her father: »Let me go to my wife in her room. But he would not let him go in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.2'>He told Samson: »I thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your friend. Her younger sister is prettier. You can have her, instead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.3'>Samson said: »This time I am not going to be responsible for what I do to the Philistines!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.4'>He caught three hundred foxes. Two at a time, he tied their tails together and put torches in the knots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.5'>Then he set fire to the torches and turned the foxes loose in the Philistine wheat fields. In this way he burned up both the shocks and the standing grain still in the fields. The olive orchards were also burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.6'>When the Philistines asked who had done this, they learned that Samson had done it because his father-in-law, a man from Timnah, had given Samsons wife to a friend of Samsons. So the Philistines burned the woman to death and burned down her fathers house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>Samson said to them: »This is how you act! I swear that I will not stop until I pay you back!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.8'>He attacked them fiercely and killed many of them. After that he stayed in the cave in the cliff at Etam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.9'>The Philistines came and camped in Judah. They attacked the town of Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.10'>The men of Judah asked: »Why do you attack us?« They answered: »We came to take Samson prisoner and to treat him as he treated us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.11'>These three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the cliff at Etam and said to Samson: »Do you know that the Philistines are our rulers? What did you do?« He answered: »I did to them just what they did to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>They replied: »We have come here to tie you up and hand you over to them.« Samson said: »Give me your word that you will not kill me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.13'>They said: »We are only going to tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.« So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him back from the cliff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>When he got to Lehi, the Philistines shouted and ran toward him. Suddenly Jehovahs power made him strong. He broke the ropes around his arms and hands as if they were burnt flax.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>Samson found a fresh jawbone of a donkey. He picked it up, and killed a thousand men with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.16'>Then Samson said: »With the jawbone of a donkey I piled them in piles. With the jawbone of a donkey I killed a thousand men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.17'>When he finished speaking he threw the jawbone away. The place where this happened was named Ramath Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.18'>Samson became very thirsty. He called to Jehovah: »You gave me this great victory. Will I now die of thirst and be captured by these heathen Philistines?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.19'>God opened a hollow place in the ground there at Lehi, and water came out of it. Samson drank it and felt better. The spring was named Hakkore. It still exists there at Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.20'>Samson judged Israel for twenty years while the Philistines ruled the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.16'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.1'>Samson went to the Philistine city of Gaza. He met a prostitute and went to bed with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.2'>The people of Gaza discovered that Samson was there. They surrounded the place and waited for him all night long at the city gate. They were quiet all night, thinking: »We will wait until daybreak and kill him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.3'>However Samson stayed in bed until midnight. He got up and took hold of the city gate and pulled it up, doors, posts, lock, and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them far off to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.4'>After this, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.5'>The five Philistine kings said to her: »Entice Samson into telling you why he is so strong and how we can overpower him. Tie him up, and make him helpless. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.6'>Delilah said to Samson: »Tell me what makes you so strong. How could you be subdued and tied up?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.7'>Samson answered: »If they tie me up with seven new bowstrings that are not dried out, Ill be as weak as anybody else.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>The Philistine kings brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that were not dried out, and she tied Samson up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>She had some men waiting in another room, so she shouted: »Samson! The Philistines are coming!« But he snapped the bowstrings just as thread breaks when fire touches it. They still did not know the secret of his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.10'>Delilah told Samson: »You made a fool of me. What is the truth? Please tell me how someone could tie you up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.11'>He said: »If I am tied with new unused ropes I will be weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.12'>Delilah tied him with new ropes. Then she shouted: »Samson! The Philistines are coming!« The men were waiting in another room. However he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.13'>Delilah said to Samson: »You still make a fool of me. What is the truth? Tell me how someone could tie you up.« He told her: »If you weave my seven locks of hair into a loom, and make it tight with a peg, I will be weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.14'>Delilah lulled him to sleep. She took his seven locks of hair and wove them into the loom. She made it tight with a peg and shouted: »Samson! The Philistines are coming!« He woke up and pulled his hair loose from the loom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.15'>»How can you say you love me,« she asked: »when you do not mean it? You have made a fool of me three times. You still have not told me what makes you strong.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.16'>She kept asking him, day after day. He got sick and tired of her nagging him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.17'>So finally he told her the truth: »My hair has never been cut,« he said: »I have been dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the time I was born. I would lose my strength if my hair were cut.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>When Delilah realized that he told her the truth, she sent a message to the Philistine kings: »Come back one more time. He told me the truth. They came and brought the money with them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.19'>Delilah lulled Samson to sleep in her lap and called a man, who cut off Samsons seven locks of hair. Then she tormented him, for he had lost his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.20'>She shouted: »Samson! The Philistines are coming!« He woke up and thought: »I will get loose and go free, as always.« He did not know that Jehovah had left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.21'>The Philistines captured him and put his eyes out. They took him to Gaza, chained him with copper chains. They put him to work grinding at the mill in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.22'>His hair grew back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.23'>The Philistine kings met together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced and said: »Our god gave us victory over our enemy Samson!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.24'>They praised their god and said: »Call Samson, and make him entertain us!« They brought Samson out of the prison and they made him entertain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.25'>They forced him to stand between the columns. When the people saw him, they sang praise to their god: »Our god gave us victory over our enemy, who devastated our land and killed so many of us!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.26'>Samson said to the boy who led him by the hand: »Let me touch the columns that hold up the building. I want to lean on them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.27'>The building was crowded with men and women. All five Philistine kings were there. There were about three thousand men and women on the roof, watching Samson entertain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.28'>Samson prayed: »Sovereign Lord Jehovah please remember me. Please, God, give me my strength just this one time. With this one blow I can get even with the Philistines for putting out my two eyes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.29'>Then Samson took hold of the two middle columns holding up the building. He put one hand on each column. He pushed against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.30'>Samson shouted: »Let me die with the Philistines!« He pushed with all his might, and the building fell down on the five kings and everyone else. Samson killed more people at his death than he had killed during his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.31'>His brothers and the rest of his family came to get his body. They took him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had been Israels judge for twenty years.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.17'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.1'>There was a man named Micah, who lived in the mountains of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.2'>He said to his mother: »When someone stole those eleven hundred pieces of silver from you, you put a curse on the robber. I heard you do it. Look, I have the money. I am the one who took it.« His mother said: »Jehovah blesses you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.3'>He gave the money back to his mother. She said: »To keep the curse from falling on my son, I myself solemnly dedicate the silver to Jehovah. It will be used to make a wooden idol covered with silver. Now I will give the pieces of silver back to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.4'>He returned them to his mother. She took two hundred of the pieces of silver and gave them to a metalworker. The metalworker made an idol, carving it from wood and covering it with the silver. It was placed in Micahs house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.5'>Micah had his own place of worship. He made some idols and an ephod, and appointed one of his sons as his priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.6'>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did whatever he or she wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.7'>There was a young Levite who had been living in the town of Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.8'>The man left Bethlehem to find another place to live. While he was traveling, he came to Micahs house in the mountains of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.9'>Micah asked him: »Where do you come from?« He answered: »I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I need a place to live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.10'>Micah said: »Stay here with me. Be my adviser and priest. I will give you ten pieces of silver a year along with some clothes, and your food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.11'>The young Levite agreed to stay with Micah. He became like a son to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.12'>He lived in Micahs home. Micah made him his priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.17.13'>Micah said: »Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, since I have a Levite as a priest.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.18'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.1'>There was no king in Israel in those days. The tribe of Dan was looking for territory to claim and settle in because they had not yet received any land of their own among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.2'>The people of Dan sent five qualified men out of all the families in the tribe from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol with instructions to explore the land and spy on it. When they arrived in the mountains of Ephraim, they stayed at Micahs house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.3'>While they were at Micahs house, they recognized the accent of the young Levite, so they went up to him and asked: What are you doing here? Who brought you here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.4'>He answered: »Micah and I have an arrangement. He pays me to serve as his priest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.5'>They said to him: »Please ask God if our journey will be successful.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.6'>The priest answered: »Do not worry. Jehovah is taking care of you on this trip.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.7'>So the five men left and traveled to the town of Laish. They saw how the people there lived in security like the Sidonians. They were a peaceful, quiet people, with no argument with anyone. They had all they needed. They lived far away from the Sidonians and had nothing to do with any other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.8'>When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, the people asked them what they found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.9'>They said: »Come and attack Laish. We saw the land, and it is very good. Do not stay here doing nothing. Enter and possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.10'>»When you go you will find a secure people who do not suspect a thing. It is a big country. God has given it to you and it has all you could want.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.11'>Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol, ready for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.12'>They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place is still called Camp of Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.13'>They went from there to Micahs house in the mountains of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.14'>The five men who had gone to spy on the country around Laish said to their companions: »Did you know that here in one of these houses there is a wooden idol covered with silver? There are also other idols and an ephod. Consider what you should do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.15'>They went into Micahs house, where the young Levite lived. They greeted the Levite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.16'>The six hundred soldiers from the tribe of Dan, ready for battle, stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.17'>The five spies went straight into the house. They took the wooden idol covered with silver, the other idols, and the ephod. The priest stayed at the gate with the six hundred armed men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.18'>The men went into Micahs house and took the sacred objects. The priest asked them: »What are you doing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.19'>They told him: »Be quiet. Do not say a word. Come with us and be our priest and adviser. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.20'>This filled the priest with joy. He took the sacred objects and went along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.21'>They turned around and started off, with their children, their livestock, and their belongings going ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.22'>They traveled a good way from the house when Micah gathered his neighbors for battle. They caught up with the Danites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.23'>They shouted at them. The Danites turned around and asked Micah, »What is the problem? Why have you gathered such a company?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.24'>Micah answered: »What do you mean? You take my priest and the gods that I made, and walk off! What do I have left?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.25'>The Danites responded: »Do not say anymore or these men will get angry and attack you. You and your whole family would die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.26'>The Danites went on their way. Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.27'>They took the things Micah made and the priest who belonged to him and attacked Laish. Laish was a town of peaceful, quiet people in the same valley as Bethrehob. They killed the inhabitants and burned the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.28'>There was no one to save them, because Laish was a long way from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any other people. The Danites rebuilt the town and settled down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.29'>They changed its name from Laish to Dan, after their ancestor Dan, the son of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.30'>The Danites set up the idol to be worshiped, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses, served as a priest for the Danites. His descendants served as their priests until the people were taken away into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.31'>Micahs idol remained there as long as the Tent where God was worshiped was at Shiloh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.19'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.1'>There was still no king in Israel. There was a Levite who lived in the remote area of Mount Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.2'>She was unfaithful to him and went to her fathers house at Bethlehem in Judah. She was there four whole months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.3'>The man went after her to persuade her to return. He took his servant and two donkeys with him. The woman invited the Levite into the house, and when her father saw him, he gave him a friendly greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.4'>The young womans father insisted that he stay. So he stayed for three days. The couple had their meals and spent the nights there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.5'>The morning of the fourth day they woke up early and prepared to go. But the womans father said to the Levite: Eat first. You will feel better. You can go later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.6'>The two men sat down and ate and drank together. Then the womans father told him: »Spend the night and enjoy yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.7'>The Levite got up to go. However the father encouraged him to stay, so he spent another night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.8'>The morning of the fifth day he started to leave. The womans father said: »Eat something and wait until later in the day.« The two men ate together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.9'>When the man, his concubine, and the servant once more started to leave, the father said: »It is almost evening. Please spend the night. It will be dark soon. Stay and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early for the trip and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.10'>The man did not want to spend another night there. He and his concubine started on their way, with their servant and two donkeys with packsaddles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.11'>It was late in the day when they came near Jebus that is, Jerusalem. The servant said to his master: »Why not stop and spend the night here in this Jebusite city?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.12'>But his master said: »We are not going to stop in a city where the people are not Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.13'>»We will pass by and go a little farther and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.14'>They passed by Jebus and continued on their way. It was sunset when they came to Gibeah in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.15'>They turned off the road to spend the night there. They went into town and sat down in the city square. However no one offered to take them home for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.16'>An old man came by at the end of a days work on the farm. He was originally from the mountains of Ephraim, but he was now living in Gibeah. The other people there were from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.17'>The old man saw the traveler in the city square and asked: »Where do you come from? Where are you going?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.18'>The Levite answered: »We have been in Bethlehem in Judah. We are on our way home deep in the mountains of Ephraim. No one will put us up for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.19'>»We have fodder and straw for our donkeys and we have bread and wine for my concubine and me and for my servant. We have everything we need.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.20'>The old man said: »Come to my home. You are welcome! I will take care of you. You do not have to spend the night in the square.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.21'>He took them home and fed their donkeys. They washed their feet and ate and drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.22'>They were enjoying themselves when suddenly some sexual perverts from the town surrounded the house and pounded on the door. They said to the old man: Bring out the man who came to your house! We want to have sex with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.23'>The old man went outside and said to them: »No, my friends! Please! Do not do such an evil, immoral thing! This man is my guest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.24'>»Here is his concubine and my virgin daughter. I will bring them out now. You can have them. Do whatever you want with them. But do not do such an awful thing to this man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.25'>The men would not listen to him. The Levite took his concubine and put her outside with them. They raped her and abused her all night long and did not stop until morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.26'>At dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the old mans house. She was still there when daylight came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.27'>When her master opened the door that morning to go on his way, he found his concubine lying in front of the house with her hands reaching for the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.28'>He said: »Get up and let us go.« But there was no answer. Then he put her body across the donkey and started on his way home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.29'>When he arrived at his house he got a knife. He took his concubines body and cut it into twelve pieces. He sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.30'>Everyone who saw it said: »No such deed has been seen or done since the people of Israel left Egypt! We must do something about this! What will we do?«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.20'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.1'>The people of Israel came from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, as well as from the land of Gilead in the east. They were united in Jehovahs presence at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.2'>The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were present at this gathering of Gods people. There were four hundred thousand foot soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.3'>Now the people of Benjamin heard that all the other Israelites had gathered at Mizpah. The Israelites asked: »Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.4'>»The Levite whose concubine had been murdered answered: »My concubine and I went to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.5'>»The men of Gibeah came to get me. They surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me. Instead they raped my concubine, and she died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.6'>»I took her body and cut it in pieces. Then I sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel for these people have committed an evil and immoral act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.7'>»What are you Israelites going to do about this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.8'>The people stood together and said: »None of us, whether he lives in a tent or in a house, will go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.9'>»This is what we will do: We will draw lots and choose some men to attack Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.10'>»One tenth of the men in Israel will provide food for the army. The others will go and punish Gibeah for this immoral act they committed in Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.11'>The men of Israel assembled with one purpose, to attack the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.12'>The tribes of Israel sent messengers through the territory of the tribe of Benjamin to say: »What is this crime that you have committed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.13'>»Hand over those perverts in Gibeah, so that we can kill them and remove this evil from Israel.« But the people of Benjamin would not listen to their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.14'>People from all the cities of Benjamin came to Gibeah to fight the other people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.15'>They mobilized twenty-six thousand soldiers from their cities that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.16'>Besides these, the citizens of Gibeah gathered seven hundred specially chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a strand of hair and never miss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.17'>Not including the tribe of Benjamin, the well-trained soldiers of Israel numbered four hundred thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.18'>The Israelites went to the house of God at Bethel, and there they asked God: »Which of us should attack the Benjaminites first?« Jehovah answered: »The tribe of Judah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.19'>So the Israelites started out the next morning and camped near the city of Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.20'>They went to attack the army of Benjamin, and placed the soldiers in battle array to fight against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.21'>The army of Benjamin came out of the city. That day they killed twenty-two thousand Israelite soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.22'>The Israelite army was encouraged as they placed the soldiers in position again at the place where they put themselves the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.23'>They mourned in the presence of Jehovah until evening. They asked him if they should go again in battle against their brothers the Benjaminites? Jehovahs answer was: »Yes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.24'>The Israelites marched against the army of Benjamin a second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.25'>The second time the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah. This time they killed eighteen thousand trained Israelite soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.26'>The people of Israel went up to Bethel and mourned. They sat there in Jehovahs presence and fasted until evening. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole in the presence of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.27'>The Ark of the Covenant was there at Bethel in those days. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, was in charge of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.28'>The people asked Jehovah: »Should we go to battle against our brothers the Benjaminites again, or should we cease?« Jehovah answered: »Fight. Tomorrow I will give you victory over them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.29'>The Israelites hid some soldiers around Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.30'>Then for the third straight day they marched against the army of Benjamin. They placed their soldiers in battle position facing Gibeah, as they had done before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.31'>The Benjaminites came out to fight and were drawn away from the city. Just as before they killed some Israelites in the open country, on the road to Bethel and on the road to Gibeah. They killed about thirty Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.32'>The Benjaminites said: »They are defeated just as before. But the Israelites planned to retreat and lead them away from the city onto the roads.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.33'>The main army of the Israelites pulled back and regrouped at Baaltamar. The men surrounding Gibeah suddenly rushed out of hiding in the rocky country around the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.34'>Ten thousand, specially chosen men, out of all Israel, attacked Gibeah, and the fighting was fierce. The Benjaminites did not realize they were about to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.35'>Jehovah gave Israel victory over the army of Benjamin. The Israelites killed twenty five thousand one hundred of the enemy that day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.36'>The Benjaminites knew they were defeated. The main body of the Israelite army had retreated from the Benjaminites. This is because they relied on the men that were hiding around Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.37'>These men ran quickly toward Gibeah. They spread out and killed everyone there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.38'>The main Israelite army and the men in hiding had a prearranged signal. When they saw a big cloud of smoke going up from the town,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.39'>the Israelites out on the battlefield were to turn around. By this time the Benjaminites had already killed the thirty Israelites. They told themselves: »We have beaten them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>The signal appeared. A cloud of smoke rose above the town. The Benjaminites looked behind them to see the whole city going up in flames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.41'>Then the Israelites turned around. The Benjaminites were thrown into panic because they could see that they were about to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.42'>They retreated from the Israelites. They ran toward the open country and could not escape. They were caught between the main army and the men now coming out of the city. They were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.43'>The Israelites trapped the enemy. Without stopping they pursued them as far as a point east of Gibeah. They killed them as they advanced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.44'>Eighteen thousand of the best Benjaminite soldiers were killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.45'>The others turned and ran to the open country to Rimmon Rock. Five thousand of them were killed on the roads. The Israelites continued to pursue the rest to Gidom, killing two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.46'>In all, twenty-five thousand brave Benjaminites were killed that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.47'>Six hundred men were able to escape to the open country to Rimmon Rock. They stayed there four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.48'>The Israelites turned back against the rest of the Benjaminites and killed them all, men and women, children and animals as well. They burned every town in the area.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.21'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.1'>The Israelites gathered at Mizpah. They made a solemn promise to Jehovah: »None of us will allow a daughter to marry a Benjaminite.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.2'>The people of Israel went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening. They lifted their voices and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.3'>They said: »Jehovah God of Israel, why has this happened? Why is the tribe of Benjamin about to disappear from Israel?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.4'>The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.5'>They asked: »Is there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in Jehovahs presence at Mizpah?« They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who had not gone to Mizpah would be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.6'>The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites. They said: »Israel has lost one of its tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.7'>»We have made a solemn promise to Jehovah that we will not give them any of our daughters. How can we make sure that the remaining men of Benjamin will have wives?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.8'>When they asked if some group out of the tribes of Israel had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah, they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.9'>No one from Jabesh responded to the roll call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>The assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders: Go kill everyone in Jabesh, including women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.11'>Kill all the males, and also every woman who is not a virgin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.12'>They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.13'>The whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>The Benjaminites came back. And the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed. But there were not enough of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because Jehovah had broken the unity of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>So the leaders said: »There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin. What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>»Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>»We cannot allow them to marry our daughters. We have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>They said: »The yearly festival of Jehovah at Shiloh is coming soon. Shiloh is north of Bethel, south of Lebonah, and east of the road between Bethel and Shechem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.20'>They told the Benjaminites: »Go hide in the vineyards.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>»When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you should take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>»If their fathers or brothers come to you and protest, you can tell them: Please let us keep them, because we did not take them from you in battle to be our wives. Since you did not give them to us, you are not guilty of breaking your promise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>The Benjaminites did this. Each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away. They went back to their own territory, rebuilt their towns, and lived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>The rest of the Israelites left, and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</verse>
