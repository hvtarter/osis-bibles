      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (55 C.E.) (Ephesus)</title>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>This letter is from Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>To the congregation of God at Corinth. To you, who are sanctified in Christ Jesus. You who are called to be holy ones, with all whom in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. He is both their Lord and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>He enriches you in every way, in all speaking, and in all knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>The testimony of Christ was confirmed verifiedestablished in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>You do not lack spiritual gifts as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>He will also confirm establish you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there are no divisions among you. You should be perfectly joined together united in the same mind and thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>The house of Chloe told me, my brothers, that there are disputes among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Concerning that I say, that each one of you said, »I follow Paul;« and »I follow Apollos;« and »I follow Cephas;« and »I follow Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul impaled for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>So no one should say that I baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides that I do not know whether I baptized any others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the good news: not with wisdom of words, lest the stake of Christ be emptied of its effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the preaching of the stake is foolishness to those who perish. It is the power of God to us who are saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>It is written: »I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.« (Isaiah 29:14)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>This is the wisdom of God that the world through its wisdom did not come to know God. God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>We preach Christ impaled. It is a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, it is Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>Consider your calling, brothers. Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>Instead God chose the foolish things of the world to confuse shame the wise. God chose the weak things of the world to confuse shame the things that are mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>God also chose the base things of the world, and things which are despised, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>No human being should boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>It is because of him you are united with Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>Let it be as it is written, »He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah!« (Jeremiah 9:24)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>Brothers, I did not come to you with superiority of speech or with human wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>I decided not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and his death on the torture stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I came to you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith should not exist in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>How is it we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who come to nothing are doomed to destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>We speak the wisdom of God in a secret, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the ages generations and human entities for our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this age knew understood for had they known it they would not have impaled the glorious Lord esteemed Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>It is written: »Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, and it has not entered into the heart of man, the things God prepared for those who love him.« (Isaiah 64:4)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God revealed them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit investigates searches all things, yes even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knows the things of a man, except the mental disposition that is in man? Even so no one knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God. This is so we might know the things that are freely given to us from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>We speak these things, not in the words that man's wisdom teaches. But we speak them with the words the Holy Spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God. They are foolishness to him! He cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>He that is spiritual judges all things, yet no man judges him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>»Who has understood the mind of Jehovah, or has instructed him, as his counselor?« (Isaiah 40:13) But we do have the mind purposefeelingsthoughtsunderstanding of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as fleshly men, as babes infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you milk and not solid food. You were not able to receive it. You are not able now!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>You are still fleshly! There is envy, strife, and divisions among you. Do you not walk as ordinary men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>While one said, »I belong to Paul;« and another, »I belong to Apollos;« are you not fleshly human beings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God caused the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>Neither he that plants and neither he that waters is anything; but God gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one in purpose and every man will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are fellow workers together with God. You are God's field under cultivation. You are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let every man take heed how he builds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>No other foundation can be laid than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any man builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, and stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>every man's work will be made known, for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will prove what sort every man's work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If a man's work that he built upon lasts, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If a man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he will be saved by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>God will destroy any man who defiles the temple of God! For the temple of God is holy. You are that temple!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. It is written: »He catches the wise in their own craftiness deception.« (Job 5:13)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again: »Jehovah knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain uselessempty.« (Psalm 94:11)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no man boast in men. For all things are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>People should regard us as servants of Christ. God has trusted us with his secrets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>It is required of stewards that a man is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>I know nothing against myself. Yet this does not acquit me, but he that judges me is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make apparent the counsels of the hearts. Then each mans praise will come from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Brothers I have applied these things to myself and to Apollos for your sakes. That way you might learn the value of the saying: Do not go beyond the things written. None of you should be arrogant self-important against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who made you superior to different than another? What do you have that you did not receive? If you did receive it, why do you brag, as if you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are full and now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us. I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has placed us apostles last as men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ. But you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honorable, but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst. We are naked. We are treated badly and we are homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>We labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being slandered, we answer kindly. We are made as the filth of the world and are the refuse of all things to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>Though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>For this reason I urge you to imitate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>I send Timothy, my beloved son faithful in the Lord, to you for this purpose. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ, just as I teach it in every congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some have become proud arrogant, thinking that I would not come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if God wills, and I will get to know what the proud ones do and not what they say, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you want? Shall I come to you with punishment or with love, and in the mild spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is reported that there is sexual immorality among you. This type of fornication is not even found among the people of the nations who do not know God. There is a man who has his fathers wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are proud! You should have been filled with sadness that he did this deed. And you should have ejected expelledexcommunicateddisfellowshiped him from your congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>I am not there with you in person. But I am with you in spirit. I have already judged the man who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>When you assemble in the name and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, I will be with you in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>Deliver this one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch of dough. For even Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote in a letter to you not to keep company with fornicators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Yet you cannot completely avoid the fornicators of this world, nor the greedy persons, nor cheaters and robbers, nor those who worship idols. To do so you would have to leave this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>I wrote you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother who is a fornicator, or who is greedy, or who worships idols, or constantly gets drunk, or cheats people. Do not even eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>What have I to do with judging those outside in the world? Do we not judge those who are inside the congregation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>God judges those outside. Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>If you have a dispute with another Christian do you dare to go to a law court before judges who are ungodly? Why not let the holy ones decide who is right?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if you will judge the world, are you unworthy to judge these small matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the matters that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, would you appoint as judges those who mean nothing to the congregation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to shame you. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? Not one who would be able to judge between his brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court against brother, and this before unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>It is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not let yourself be wronged? Why not let your selves be defrauded cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Instead you do wrong and defraud, and you do this to your brothers and sisters!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor people who worship idols, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>That is what some of you were. You have been washed clean and now you are sanctified. The Spirit of our God declares you righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient profitablegood. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the authority powercontrol of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will destroy both of them. Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>God has resurrected the Lord, and will also resurrect us by his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and unite them with turn them into the members of a prostitute? God forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>What? Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one united with her body? For he said: »Two will be one flesh.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>He who is joined to the Lord is one united with him in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee from fornication! Every sin that a man does is outside his body. But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>What? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? That one Greek: »hos he ho« which, that one is in you. You received it from God. You are not your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>You are bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Concerning the things that you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch have sex with a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband fulfill his marital duties to his wife and also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife has no authority over her own body, but her husband does. Likewise also the husband has no authority over his own body, but his wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for a time. That way you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I speak this by concession and not by commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I prefer that all men were as I am. But every man has his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they stay unmarried like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. It is better to marry than to be inflamed with lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord commands do not let the wife depart from her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>If she leaves, let her remain unmarried or become reconciled to her husband. A husband should not divorce his wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Each man should remain in the same condition in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called being a slave? Do not let it worry you. But if you can become free, do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>He who is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman. Likewise also he who is called, being free, is Christ's slave.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But he who is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. She who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>I say this for your benefit and not to restrict you. I show you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>If any man thinks he behaves improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, let him do what he will, he does not sin if they get married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virginity he does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who gives his virginity in marriage does well; but he who does not get married does even better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>The wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she remains as she is. This is my opinion and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you:« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>Those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable, we offer these more honors. Our less acceptable parts have more abundant acceptability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>For our acceptable parts have no need. But God has assembled the body together, having given more abundant honor to the part that was lacking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>There should be no division in the body. So the members should have the same care for each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>When one member suffers all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>God has appointed some in the congregation: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helpers, abilities to direct, different tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and do not have love, I have become like loud sounding brass, or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>If I have the gift of prophesy, and know all secrets and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not arrogant proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Love does not act indecently. It is not selfish. It is not provoked and does not take into account a wrong suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Love does not rejoice with evil, but rejoices with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails. Where there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away. Where there are tongues, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>When the perfect comes, the partial imperfectincomplete will be done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, and reason like a child. When I became an adult I did away with childish things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see in a mirror dimly, and then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, yet zealously desire spiritual gifts, especially prophesy proclaiming Gods Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For the person who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to men, but to God. No man understands him. He speaks secrets by the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But the person who prophesies proclaims Gods Word openly speaks to men to build up, encourage and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The person who speaks in an unknown tongue enlightens himself; but he who declares Gods Word enlightens the entire congregation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I would like it that you all speak with tongues, but I prefer that you prophesy. The person who announces teachespreaches Gods Word is greater than the person who speaks with tongues. The person who speaks with tongues should have an interpreter so the congregation may receive understanding and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Inanimate objects that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>If the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>The same for you unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will speak into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore if I do not know the meaning of what someone is saying I will be a foreigner to him that speaks. And he that speaks will be a foreigner to me too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>As much as you are zealous for spiritual gifts, strive to build-up increase the enlightenment understanding of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Let the one who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding Greek: nous: mind also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding mind also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>When you bless with the spirit, how will the audience of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you said?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you give thanks well, but the other is not given understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I speak with tongues more then all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>Yet in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not be like children in understanding. When it comes to evil be innocent children but in your thinking be mature adults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>It is written in the law: »With men of other tongues and lips of foreigners I will speak to this people. Even then they will not listen to me,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Therefore speaking in tongues is a sign not for believers, but for those who do not believe. Prophesying proclaiming Gods Word serves the believer and not the unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole congregation comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and the unlearned, or unbelievers, come there will they not say that you are out of your mind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all proclaim Gods Word and an unbeliever comes there he is convinced by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>The secrets of his heart are made known. So falling down on his face he will worship God, and report, »God is truly among you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>How is it then, brothers? When you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, and has an interpretation. Let all things be done to clarify and offer understanding!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three. It should be orderly by plan and someone must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let the speaker keep silence in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak and let the others listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If there is a revelation to another while sitting there, let the others keep quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>You may all prophesy one by one in turn that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>Let the prophets control the spirits mindsmental disposition of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the congregations of the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let women keep silent in the congregations. They are not permitted to speak. They must be in submission as it says in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>When they want to learn something, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is improper for a woman to speak in the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man does not recognize understand this he will not be recognized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Seek to prophesy brothers, and do not forbid speaking with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Brothers, I declared the good news to you. You have received it and should continue strong in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>You will be saved through the good news if you hold fast to the word I preached to you. That way you will not believe in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>First of all, I delivered to you what I also received, how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>He was buried, and he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>He was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>More than five hundred brothers saw him at the same time after that. Most of them remain to this day, but some have fallen asleep in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he was seen by James, and then by all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all I also saw him, as of one with an untimely birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>I am the least of the apostles and do not deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>By the divine influence of God I am what I am. His grace was not given to me in vain for I labored more than all of them. Yet it was not I. It was the divine influence and favor of God in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore whether they preached or I preached, you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>If we preached that Christ was raised from the dead, how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is worth nothing, and your faith is also without value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>We are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified that God raised Christ from the dead. If he did not raise him up from the dead then the dead are not raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised up then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ is not resurrected, your faith is worth nothing, and you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>Christ has risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of those who slept in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>Death came because of what one man did. The resurrection of the dead also comes because of what one man did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>In Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>Everyone will be raised to life in the right order: Christ the first fruits and afterward those who belong to Christ at the time of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>In the end Christ will deliver the kingdom to God the Father. Christ will destroy every ruler and all authority and all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he Christ must rule as king until he God puts all enemies under his feet his control. (Psalm 2; 110) (Daniel 2:44) (Revelation 5:10; Revelation 20:6)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be destroyed will be death. (Revelation 20:14)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>According to the Scriptures: God has placed all things under his control subjection. (Ephesians 1:22) But when he said all things are placed under him, it is with the exception of God. For God is the one who placed all things under him Christ. (1 Peter 3:22) (John 3:35)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>When all things shall be subdued under the Son, then the Son will also be subjected to God who put all things under him, that God may be all in all ruler over everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>What will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why do we stand in jeopardy in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I face death daily even as I rejoice over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage was it to me if the dead do not rise? Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived: Bad company corrupts good morals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Wake up to righteousness and do not sin. Some do not have knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say: How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>You fool, that which you sow is not alive unless it first dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>That which you sow, you sow not that body that will develop, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body as it pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also celestial heavenly bodies and terrestrial earthly bodies. The glory of the celestial is one thing and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differs from another star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness and it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body and it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus it is written: »The first man Adam was made a living being.« The last Adam became a life giving spirit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>How is it the first is not spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is from the earth, earthy: the second man is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the earthy so are those who are of the earth. And as is the heavenly, so are those who are of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Corruption may not inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I show you a secret. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last reverberation of the trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>When this corruptible shall be clothed with Greek: enduo: dressed, put on incorruption, and this mortal shall be clothed with immortality, then the saying will come true: »Death is swallowed up in victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>»O death, where is your sting power to hurt? O grave, where is your victory?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks to God, because he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and unmovable. Always have plenty to do in the work of the Lord, for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
