      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Jeremiah) (580 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now King David was old and advanced in years. They put covers over him but he could not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>His servants said to him: »Your Majesty let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>They searched all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>She was very beautiful. She waited on the king and took care of him. However, he did not have intercourse with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Adonijah, son of Haggith, was very handsome. His mother gave birth to him after Maacah had Absalom. Adonijah boasted about himself, saying, »I will be king.« He got a chariot and horses and fifty men to run ahead of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>His father never confronted him by asking: »Why have you done this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>But Adonijah had discussed his actions with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, so they supported him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But the priest Zadok, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the prophet Nathan, Shimei, Rei, and David's thirty special guards did not join Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's other sons, all the men of Judah, and the king's officials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But he did not invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the special guard or his brother Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then Nathan asked Solomon's mother Bathsheba: »Have you heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, has become king, and our master David does not even know about it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>»Bathsheba, let me give you some advice about how to save your life and your son's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>»Go now to King David and ask him: Your Majesty, did you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king? How is it that Adonijah has become king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Nathan added: »While you are still talking with King David, I will come in and confirm your story.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, was taking care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>Bathsheba bowed low before the king. He asked: »What do you want?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>She answered: »Your Majesty, you made me a solemn promise in the name of Jehovah your God that my son Solomon would be king after you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>»Adonijah has already become king. You do not know anything about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>»He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited your sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of your army to the feast. However he did not invite your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>»Your Majesty. The people of Israel want you to tell them who is to succeed you as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>»If you do not my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors when you die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>Nathan arrived at the palace while she spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>The king was told that the prophet was there. Nathan went in and bowed low before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>Nathan said: »Your Majesty. Did you announce that Adonijah would succeed you as king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>»This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited all your sons, Joab the commander of your army, and Abiathar the priest, and right now they are feasting with him and shouting: Long live King Adonijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>»But he did not invite Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon or me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>»Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>King David said: »Ask Bathsheba to come back in.« She came and stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>Then he said to her: »I promise you by the living God Jehovah, who has rescued me from all my troubles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, that your son Solomon would succeed me as king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Bathsheba bowed low and said: »May my lord the king live a very long time!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>Then King David sent for Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah. When they came in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>he said to them: »Take my court officials with you; have my son Solomon ride my own mule, and escort him to Gihon Spring,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout: Long live King Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>»Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king. He is the one I have chosen to be the ruler over Israel and Judah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>»It will be done,« answered Benaiah, »and may Jehovah your God confirm it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>»Jehovah has been with Your Majesty. May he also be with Solomon and make his reign even more prosperous than yours.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>Zadok took the container of olive oil that he had brought from the Tent of Jehovahs presence, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted: »Long live King Solomon!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>All the people followed him. They blew flutes and celebrated so loudly that their voices shook the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>Adonijah and all his guests heard this while they were eating. When Joab heard the sound of the horn, he asked: »Why all this noise in the city?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>He was still speaking when Jonathan, son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. »Come in,« Adonijah said: »You are an honorable man. You must be bringing good news.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>»Not at all,« Jonathan answered Adonijah. »His Majesty King David has made Solomon king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>»The king sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites with him. They placed him on the king's mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>»The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anointed him king at Gihon. They came from there celebrating. The city is excited. That is the sound you heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>»Solomon is seated on the royal throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>»Even the royal officials have come to congratulate His Majesty King David, saying: May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his reign greater than your reign. The king himself bowed down on his bed</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>and prayed: Let us praise Jehovah the God of Israel. Today he made one of my descendants succeed me as king. He let me live to see it!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>Adonijah's guests were afraid. So they all left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>Adonijah, in great fear of Solomon, went to the Tent of Jehovahs presence and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>King Solomon was told that Adonijah was afraid of him and that he was holding on to the corners of the altar. He heard that he said: »First, I want King Solomon to swear to me that he will not have me put to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>Solomon replied: »If he is loyal, not even a hair on his head will be touched. If he is not, he will die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar. Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him. The king said to him: »You may go home.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>David was about to die. He called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>»It is my time to die. I go the way of all people of the earth. Be strong and be a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>»Do what Jehovah your God orders you to do. Obey all his laws and commands, as written in the Law of Moses. That way wherever you go you may prosper in everything you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>»If you obey Jehovah he will keep the promise he made when he told me, Your descendants will rule Israel as long as they are careful to obey my commands faithfully with all their heart and being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>»Remember what Joab did to me by killing the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. You remember how he murdered them in time of peace. This was revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war. He killed innocent men. I bear the responsibility for what he did. I suffer the consequences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>»You know what to do. You must not let him die a natural death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>»But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead and take care of them. They were kind to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>"There is also Shimei son of Gera, from the town of Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me with a bitter curse the day I went to Mahanaim. When he met me at the Jordan River, I gave him my solemn promise in the name of Jehovah, saying, I will not have you killed by the sword.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>»However you must not let him go unpunished. You know what to do. You must make sure he is put to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>David died and was buried in David's City.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>He was king of Israel for forty years. He ruled seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Solomon succeeded his father David as king. His royal power was firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. »Is this a friendly visit?« She asked. »Yes,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>I have something to discuss with you. He said. What is it? She asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>He said: »You know the kingship was mine. All Israel expected me to be their king. But the kingship has been turned over to my brother because Jehovah gave it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>»I have one request to make to you. Do not say no to me.« She responded: »Tell me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>He said: »Will you go to Solomon the king for he will not say No to you. And make my request that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>Bathsheba said: »Indeed, I will make your request to the king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to meet her and bowed down to her. He took his place on the king's throne and she sat at his right hand on the seat made ready for the king's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said: »I have one small request to make of you. Do not say No to me.« The king replied: »Speak mother for I will not say no to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>She said: »Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>Then King Solomon answered: »Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah? Take the kingdom for him in addition, for he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, are on his side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>King Solomon took an oath by Jehovah, saying: »May God's punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>»Now by the living God Jehovah who has given me my throne from David my father. He made me one of a line of kings. He gave me his word. Adonijah will be put to death this day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada to attack and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>The king spoke to Abiathar the priest: »Go to your fields at Anathoth. You deserve death. But I will not put you to death now, because you carried the Ark of Jehovah God before David my father. You were with him in all his troubles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>Solomon did not allow Abiathar to be priest any longer. So the word of Jehovah came true concerning the sons of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>Joab received news of this for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters. He was not on Absalom's side. Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of Jehovah and put his hands on the corners of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>When King Solomon heard about this he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovah and told Joab: Come out. Joab said: »No! Let me die here.« So Benaiah returned to the king and gave him the answer Joab gave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>The king said: »Do as he said. Kill him there and bury him in the earth. This will remove the guilt of his senseless murders from my fathers family and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>»Jehovah will punish Joab for those murders he committed without my father David's knowledge. Joab killed two innocent men who were better men than he: Abner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, commander of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>»Jehovah will repay him for the blood Joab shed. The blood will fall on Joab and on his descendants as long as they live. Jehovah will always give success to David's descendants who sit on his throne.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovahs presence and killed Joab. He was buried at his home in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>The king sent for Shimei and said to him: »Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Live in it and do not leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>»If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook, you will die and it will be your fault.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>»As you say, Your Majesty,« Shimei answered. »I will do what you say.« So he lived in Jerusalem a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>Three years later, however, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath, Achish son of Maacah. When Shimei heard that they were in Gath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath, to find his slaves. He found them and brought them back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>When Solomon heard what Shimei did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>he sent for him and said: »I made you promise in Jehovahs name not to leave Jerusalem. I warned you that if you ever did, you would die. Did you not agree to it and say that you would obey me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>»Why did you break your promise and disobey my command?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>»You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David. Jehovah will punish you for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>»But he will bless me, and he will make David's kingdom secure forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>The king gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada. He killed Shimei. Solomon was now in complete control.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>Solomon made an alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. He brought her to live in David's City until he finished building his palace, the Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>A Temple had not yet been built for Jehovah. The people were still offering sacrifices at many different altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>Solomon loved Jehovah. He followed the instructions of his father David. He also slaughtered animals and offered them as sacrifices on different altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>One time he went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because that was where the most used altar was. He offered hundreds of burnt offerings there in the past.</verse>
        <title>SOLOMON ASKS FOR WISDOM</title>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>That night Jehovah appeared to him in a dream and asked him: »What do you want me to give you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>Solomon answered: »You always showed great love for my father David, your servant. He was good, loyal, and honest in his relation with you. You have continued to show him your great and constant love by giving him a son who today rules in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>»O Jehovah God, you allowed me to succeed my father as king, even though I am very young and do not know how to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>»I am among the people you have chosen to be your own. They are a people who are so many that they cannot be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give me the wisdom I need to rule your people with justice. Help me know the difference between good and evil. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>Jehovah was pleased that Solomon asked for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>He said to him: »Because you have asked for the wisdom to rule justly, instead of long life for yourself or riches or the death of your enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.12'>»I will do what you have asked. I will give you more wisdom and understanding than anyone has ever had. There has never been nor will ever be anyone like you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.13'>»I will also give you what you did not ask for. All your life you will have wealth and honor, more than that of any other king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.14'>»If you obey me and keep my laws and commands, as your father David did, I will give you a long life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.15'>Solomon woke up and was aware that God had spoken to him in the dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of Jehovahs Ark of the Covenant. He offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to Jehovah. Then he gave a feast for all his officials.</verse>
        <title>SOLOMON JUDGES TWO MOTHERS</title>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.16'>One day two women who were prostitutes came to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.17'>One of them said: »Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby boy at home while she was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.18'>»Two days after my child was born she also gave birth to a baby boy. Only the two of us were there in the house. No one else was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.19'>»One night she accidentally rolled over on her baby and smothered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.20'>»She got up during the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep. She took him to her bed and put the dead child in my bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.21'>»The next morning I woke up and was going to nurse my baby. It was dead. I looked at it more closely and saw that it was not my child.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.22'>The other woman said: »The living child is mine, and the dead one is yours!« The first woman answered back: »The dead child is yours, and the living one is mine!« They argued before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.23'>King Solomon said: »Each of you claims that the living child is hers and that the dead child belongs to the other one.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.6'>Each room in the lowest story was seven and one half feet wide. The middle story was nine feet wide. The top story was ten and one half feet wide. The Temple wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without having their beams built into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.7'>The stones with which the Temple was built were prepared at the quarry. That way there was no noise made by hammers, axes, or any other iron tools as the Temple was built.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.26'>Both were the same size and shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.27'>They were placed side by side in the Most Holy Place. Their outstretched wings touched each other in the middle of the room, and the other two wings touched the walls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.3'>It had three rows of cedar pillars, fifteen in each row, with cedar beams resting on them. The ceiling was of cedar, extending over storerooms, which were supported by the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.4'>On each of the two sidewalls there were three rows of windows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.5'>All the doors and doorframes were rectangular. There were three doors facing each other on opposite sides of the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.6'>Solomon made the Hall of Pillars seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide. In front of the hall was an entrance hall with pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.7'>He made the hall for the throne. It was a place where he could sit on his throne and judge. The hall was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.8'>His own private quarters were in a different location than the hall containing the throne. They were similar in design. Solomon also built private quarters like this for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.9'>From the foundation to the roof, all these buildings, including the large courtyard, were built with high-grade stone blocks. The stone blocks were cut to size and trimmed with saws on their inner and outer faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.10'>The foundation was made with large, high-grade expensive stones. Some were twelve feet and others fifteen feet long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.11'>Above the foundation were cedar beams and high-grade expensive stone blocks, which were cut to size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.12'>The large courtyard had three layers of cut stone blocks and a layer of cedar beams, like the inner courtyard of Jehovahs Temple and the entrance hall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.13'>King Solomon sent for a man named Huram, a craftsman living in the city of Tyre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.14'>Huram was knowledgeable and skilled in making things out of copper. He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali. His father had been from Tyre. He went to do all of King Solomons work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.15'>Huram cast two copper columns. Each one was twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet in circumference. They were placed at the entrance of the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.16'>He also made two copper crowns. Each one was seven and one half feet tall. They were to be placed on top of the columns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.18'>They had two rows of copper pomegranates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.19'>The crowns on the top of the columns were shaped like lilies, six feet tall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.20'>and were placed on a rounded section which was above the chain design. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows around each crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.21'>Huram placed these two copper columns in front of the entrance of the Temple. The column on the south side was named Jachin and the one on the north was named Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.22'>The lily-shaped copper crowns were on top of the columns. The work on the columns was completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.23'>Hiram made a round tank of copper, seven and one half feet deep, fifteen feet in diameter, and forty-five feet in circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.24'>All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of copper gourds. They were all cast in one piece with the rest of the tank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.25'>The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward. Three faced in each direction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.26'>The sides of the tank were three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup. It curved outward like the petals of a lily. The tank held about ten thousand gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.27'>Huram also made ten copper carts. Each cart was six feet long, six feet wide, and four and one half feet high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.28'>They were made of square panels set in frames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.29'>There were figures of lions, bulls, and cherubim on the panels. And there were spiral relief figures on the frames above and underneath the lions and bulls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.30'>Each cart had four copper wheels with copper axles. At the four corners were copper supports for a basin. The supports were decorated with spiral relief figures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.31'>There was a circular frame on top for the basin. It projected eighteen inches upward from the top of the cart and seven inches down into it. It had carvings around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.32'>The wheels were under the panels. They were twenty-five inches high. The axles were of one piece with the carts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.33'>The wheels were like chariot wheels. Their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.34'>There were four supports at the bottom corners of each cart. They were of one piece with the cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.35'>There was a nine-inch band around the top of each cart. Its supports and the panels were of one piece with the cart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.36'>The supports and panels were decorated with figures of cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was space for them, with spiral figures all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.37'>This is how the carts were made. They were all alike, having the same size and shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.38'>Huram made ten basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet in diameter and held two hundred gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.39'>He placed five of the carts on the south side of the Temple. The other five were placed on the north side. The tank was placed at the southeast corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.40'>Huram made the pots and spades and the basins. Huram finished all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.41'>The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars; and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.45'>And the pots and the spades and the basins; all the vessels which Huram made for King Solomon, for the house of Jehovah, were of polished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.46'>He made them of liquid metal in the lowland district of the Jordan River. This was at the river crossing at Adama, between Succoth and Zarethan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.47'>Solomon did not weigh all the utensils because so much copper was used. No one tried to determine how much the copper weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.48'>Solomon made all the furnishings for Jehovahs Temple: the gold altar, the gold table on which the bread of the presence was placed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.49'>lamps stands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north in front of the inner room, flowers, lamps, gold tongs,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.5'>King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Ark and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle, too many to count.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.7'>Their outstretched wings covered the box and the poles it was carried by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.8'>The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.9'>There was nothing inside the Ark of the Covenant except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.10'>As the priests were leaving the Temple, it was suddenly filled with a cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.11'>It shined with the dazzling light of Jehovahs presence. They could not go back in to perform their duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.12'>Solomon prayed: »Jehovah, you have placed the sun in the sky, yet you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.13'>»Now I have built a majestic temple for you, a place for you to live in for a very long time.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.64'>On that day the king designated the courtyard in front of Jehovahs Temple as a holy place.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.65'>At that time Solomon and all Israel celebrated the festival. A large crowd had come from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt to be near Jehovah our God for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.8.66'>On the eighth day he dismissed the people. They blessed the king and went to their tents. They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings Jehovah had given his servant David and his people Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.18'>They left Midian and went to Paran. Taking some men from Paran with them, they went to Pharaoh the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a home, a food allowance, and land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.19'>Pharaoh approved of Hadad. So he gave Hadad his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, to be Hadad's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.20'>Tahpenes' sister had a son named Genubath. Tahpenes presented the boy to Pharaoh in the palace, and Genubath lived in the palace among Pharaoh's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.21'>When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David had died and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to the king: »Let me go back to my own country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.22'>»Why?« The king asked. »Have I failed to give you something? Is that why you want to go back home?« Hadad answered: »Just let me go.« He went back to his country. As king of Edom, Hadad was an evil, bitter enemy of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.23'>God also caused Rezon son of Eliada to turn against Solomon. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.24'>and had become the leader of a gang of outlaws. This happened after David defeated Hadadezer and slaughtered his Syrian allies. Rezon and his gang lived in Damascus, where his followers made him king of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.25'>He was trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon. This is the damage Hadad did: he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.26'>Jeroboam rebelled against the king. He was the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.27'>This is how he rebelled: Solomon was building the Millo supporting terraces and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.28'>Jeroboam was a capable and responsible man. Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.29'>When Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road. Ahijah was wearing a new robe. They were by themselves in the open country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.30'>Ahijah took his new robe in his hands and tore it into twelve pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.31'>He said to Jeroboam: »Take ten of the parts, for this is what Jehovah said: I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force. I will give ten tribes to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.32'>»But one tribe will be his because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem. Out of the tribes of Israel he will have the town I have made mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.33'>»I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has worshiped foreign gods. Astarte, the goddess of Sidon; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Molech, the god of Ammon. Solomon disobeyed me. He has done wrong! He has not obeyed my laws and commands as his father David did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.34'>»I will not take the entire kingdom away from Solomon. I will keep him in power as long as he lives. This I will do for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who obeyed my laws and commands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.39'>»Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.40'>For this reason Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam. Jeroboam escaped to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon's death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.41'>Everything else that Solomon did, his career, and his wisdom, are all recorded in The History of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.42'>He was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.43'>He died and was buried in David's City. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.1'>Rehoboam went to Shechem. All the people of northern Israel gathered to make him king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.2'>Jeroboam son of Nebat went to Egypt to escape from King Solomon. When he heard this news he returned from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.3'>The people of the northern tribes sent for him. Then they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.4'>»Your father Solomon treated us harshly and placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.5'>»Come back in three days and I will give you my answer,« he replied. So they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.6'>Then King Rehoboam consulted elders who had been with Solomon his father when he was living. He said: »In your opinion, what answer am I to give to these people?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.7'>They said to him: »If you will be a servant to this people today, caring for them and giving them a favorable answer, then they will be your servants for ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.8'>But he paid no attention to the opinion of the elders. He went to the young men who were his advisors:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.9'>»What is your opinion?« He asked: »What answer are we to give to this people? They want me to lighten the burdens placed on them by my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.10'>His young advisors said: »This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying: Your father put a hard yoke on us; will you make it less? Say to them: My little finger is thicker than my father's body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.11'>»If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder! My father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.12'>So all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day just as the king ordered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.13'>The king gave them a harsh answer. He paid no attention to the suggestion of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.14'>He gave them the answer suggested by the young advisors. He said: »My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder! My father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.15'>The king did not listen to the people. This came about by Jehovahs purpose, so that what he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat, might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.16'>When all Israel realized that the king would not respond to their request, the people in answer said to the king: »What share do we have in David? What is our heritage in the son of Jesse? To your tents, O Israel; now see to your people, David.« So Israel went away to their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.17'>Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.18'>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the overseer of the forced work. He was stoned to death by all Israel. King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to escape to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.19'>Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.20'>When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they requested a meeting of the people. At that meeting they made him king over Israel. There was none who followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.21'>When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together one hundred and eighty thousand of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He wanted to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.22'>But God told the prophet Shemaiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.23'>»Give this message to Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.24'>»Do not attack the people of Israel, your own relatives. All of you go home. What has happened is my will.« They all obeyed Jehovahs command and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.25'>King Jeroboam of Israel fortified the town of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there for a while. Then he left and fortified the town of Penuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.26'>He thought to himself: »The way things are my people will go to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices to Jehovah at the Temple there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.27'>»They will transfer their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah and will kill me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.28'>After asking for advice, the king made two golden calves. He said: You have been worshiping in Jerusalem long enough. Israel, here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.29'>He placed one in Bethel and the other in Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.30'>This became Israels sin, worshiping the golden calves. The people went as far as Dan to worship the one calf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.31'>Jeroboam built worship sites on hilltops. He appointed men who were not descended from Levi to be priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.32'>Jeroboam appointed a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, just like the festival in Judah. He went to the altar in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had made. He appointed priests from the illegal worship sites to serve in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.33'>He went to his altar in Bethel to burn an offering on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the festival he invented for the Israelites.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.1'>A man of God from Judah went to Bethel. He arrived there while Jeroboam was at the altar ready to offer a sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.2'>He actually spoke against the altar: »O altar, altar, this is what Jehovah says: A child, whose name will be Josiah, will be born to the family of David. He will slaughter the priests serving at the pagan altars who offer sacrifices on you. He will burn human bones on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.3'>The prophet went on to say: »This altar will fall apart. The ashes on it will be scattered. Then you will know that Jehovah has spoken through me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.4'>King Jeroboam heard this. He pointed his outstretched hand at him and ordered: »Seize that man!« At once the king's arm became paralyzed so that he could not pull it back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.5'>The altar suddenly fell apart and the ashes spilled to the ground. This is what the prophet predicted in the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.6'>King Jeroboam said to the prophet: »Please pray to Jehovah your God for me, and ask him to heal my arm!« The prophet prayed to Jehovah and the king's arm was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.7'>Then the king said to the prophet: »Come home with me and have something to eat. I will reward you for what you have done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.8'>The prophet answered: Even if you gave me half of your wealth, I would not go with you or eat or drink anything with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.9'>I was ordered by the word of Jehovah, he said: »You are not to take food or a drink of water, and you are not to go back the way you came.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.10'>So he went another way, and not by the way he came to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.11'>There was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons told him what the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They reported what he said to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.12'>Their father asked: »Which way did he go?« His sons saw which way the man of God went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.13'>So the prophet said to his sons: »Saddle the donkey for me.« So they saddled the donkey and he mounted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.14'>He rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree. »Are you the man of God who came from Judah?» He asked. « I am.« Came his reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.15'>He said: »Come back to the house with me and have a meal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.16'>But the man of God from Judah replied: »I may not go back with you or go into your house. I will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.17'>»Jehovah said to me: You are not to take food or water there, or go back again by the way you came.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.18'>Then he said: »I am a prophet like you. An angel said to me by the word of Jehovah, Take him back with you and give him food and water.« But he lied to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.19'>So he went back with him, and had a meal in his house and a drink of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.20'>But while they were seated at the table, the word of Jehovah came to the old prophet who had brought him back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.21'>Crying out to the man of God who came from Judah, he said: »Jehovah says, because you have gone against the voice of Jehovah, and have not done as Jehovah ordered you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.22'>but have come back, and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water; your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.23'>After the meal he made the donkey ready for the prophet whom he had taken back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.24'>He went on his way. A lion met him on the road and jumped him and killed him. His dead body was stretched in the road with the donkey by its side. The lion was by the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.25'>Some people who passed by saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side. They brought the news to the town where the old prophet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.26'>The old prophet heard about it and said: »That is the prophet who disobeyed Jehovahs command! Jehovah sent the lion to attack and kill him, just as Jehovah said he would.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.27'>He said to his sons: »Saddle my donkey for me.« They did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.28'>He rode away to find the prophet's body lying on the road. The donkey and the lion were still standing by it. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.29'>The old prophet picked up the body and brought it back to Bethel on the donkey. There he mourned over it and buried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.30'>He buried it in his own family grave. He and his sons mourned over it, saying: »Oh my brother, my brother!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.31'>After the burial the prophet said to his sons: »When I die, bury me in this grave and lay my body next to his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.32'>»The words that he spoke at Jehovahs command against the altar in Bethel and against all the places of worship in the towns of Samaria will surely come true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.33'>King Jeroboam of Israel still did not turn from his evil ways. He continued to choose priests from ordinary families to serve at the altars he had built. He ordained as priest anyone who wanted to be one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.13.34'>This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam. It brought about its ruin and total destruction from the face of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.10'>He was king for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.11'>Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as David his father did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.12'>He banished perverted persons from the land. He removed those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods. He removed all the idols his fathers had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.13'>He would not let Maacah his mother be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah. Asa had the obscene image cut down and burned by the Kidron Stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.14'>The high places were not taken away. Nevertheless Asas heart was true to Jehovah all his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.15'>He brought into the Temple of Jehovah all the things he and his father made holy, silver and gold and vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.16'>There was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, through out their reigns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.17'>And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah. He fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or in to Asa the king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.18'>Then Asa took all the silver and gold still stored in Jehovahs Temple, and in the king's house, and delivered them, in the care of his servants, to Ben-hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Rezon, king of Aram, at Damascus. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.19'>Let there be an agreement between us just as there was between my father and your father. I have sent you an offering of silver and gold. End your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel that he may give up attacking me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.20'>Ben-hadad agreed to King Asas request and sent his armies to attack Israel. He conquered Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth as far as the land of Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.21'>When Baasha heard this he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.22'>Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah. Every man came to carry away the stone and the timber Baasha used to fortify Ramah. King Asa used them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.23'>The rest of the events of Asas reign, the extent of his power and the names of the cities he built are all recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Judah. His feet became diseased, as he grew old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.24'>So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was buried in the town of David his father. Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.25'>Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah; and he was king of Israel for two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.26'>He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. He copied the evil ways of his father. He made Israel sin so much that they provoked Jehovah to anger with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.27'>And Baasha, the son of Ahijah, of the family of Issachar, made a secret design against him, attacking him at Gibbethon, a town of the Philistines. Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.28'>In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha put him to death, and became king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.29'>When he became king, he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam. He killed every person of the family of Jeroboam according to the word of Jehovah as stated by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.30'>This happened because Jeroboam aroused the anger of Jehovah, the God of Israel, by the sins he committed and that he caused Israel to commit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.31'>Everything else that Nadab did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.32'>King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war as long as they reigned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.33'>In the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel. He ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.15.34'>Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against Jehovah and led Israel into sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.1'>Jehovah spoke to the prophet Jehu son of Hanani and gave him this message to give to Baasha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.2'>»I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over my people Israel. You have gone the way of Jeroboam. You made my people Israel do evil, moving me to wrath by their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.3'>»Truly, I will take away the family of Baasha. I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.4'>»Dogs will eat anyone of the family of Baasha who dies in town. The birds of the air will eat anyone who dies in the open country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.5'>The rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his power, are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.6'>Baasha rested with his fathers. He was buried at Tirzah; and Elah his son became king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.7'>The word of Jehovah came to the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani. This was a warning against Baasha and his family because of all the evil he did in the eyes of Jehovah. He made Jehovah angry by the work of his hands, because he was like the family of Jeroboam, and because he killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.8'>In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, became king of Israel in Tirzah. He was king for two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.9'>His servant Zimri, commander of half his war-carriages made plans to kill him. He was in Tirzah, drinking hard at the house of Arza, controller of the king's house in Tirzah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.10'>Zimri attacked and killed him. It was the twenty-seventh year that Asa was king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.11'>Immediately after he became king and took his place on the throne of the kingdom, he put to death all the family of Baasha. Not one male child survived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.12'>So Zimri destroyed the entire family of Baasha as Jehovah promised through the prophet Jehu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.13'>This happened because of the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, and because of all the sins they led Israel to commit. It aroused the anger of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.14'>The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.15'>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah. The people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.16'>The Israelites in the camp heard it said: »Zimri plotted against the king and killed him.« So all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king that day there in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.17'>Then Omri went up from Gibbethon, with all the army of Israel, and they attacked Tirzah, Israels capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.18'>Zimri saw that the city had fallen. So he went into the palace's inner fortress and set the palace on fire. He died in the flames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.19'>This happened because of his sins against Jehovah. Like his predecessor Jeroboam, he displeased Jehovah by his own sins and by leading Israel into sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.20'>Everything else that Zimri did, including the account of his conspiracy, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.21'>Then the army of Israel was divided into two factions. Half of the army followed Tibni, son of Ginath, and wanted to make him king. The other half followed Omri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.22'>But the half that followed Omri was stronger than the half that followed Tibni, Ginath's son. Tibni died and Omri became king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.23'>Omri began to rule Israel in Asa's thirty-first year as king of Judah. He ruled for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.24'>Omri bought a hill from Shemer for one hundred and fifty pounds of silver. He fortified the hill and built the city of Samaria on it. He named the city after its former owner, Shemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.25'>Omri did what Jehovah considered evil. He did more evil things than all the kings before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.26'>He lived exactly like Jeroboam, Nebat's son. He sinned and led Israel to sin with worthless idols. The Israelites made Jehovah the God of Israel furious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.27'>Everything else about Omri is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.28'>Omri rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria. Ahab his son became king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.29'>In the thirty-eighth year that Asa was king of Judah, Ahab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel. Ahab was king in Samaria for twenty-two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.30'>Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, even worse than all who went before him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.31'>It was as if he copied the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He took as his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidon, and became a servant and worshipper of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.32'>He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal that he built in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.33'>Ahab made an image of Asherah. He did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make Jehovah, the God of Israel, angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.16.34'>In his days Hiel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the price of Abiram, his oldest son, and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub. This was according to the word of Jehovah spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.17'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.1'>Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab: »By the living Jehovah, the God of Israel, whose servant I am, there will be no dew or rain in these years, but only at my word.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.2'>Then the word of Jehovah came to him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.3'>»Go east from here and hide by the Cherith Brook, east of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.4'>»You will drink from the brook. I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.5'>So he did as Jehovah said, living by the Cherith Brook, east of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.6'>The ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening. And he drank water from the brook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.7'>Now after a time the brook became dry, because there was no rain in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.8'>Then the word of Jehovah came to him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.9'>»Go now to Zarephath, in Zidon, and live there. I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.10'>He went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, he saw a widow woman gathering sticks. He said to her: »Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.11'>As she was going to get it, he said: »And get me some bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.12'>Then she said: »By the life of Jehovah your God, I have nothing but a little meal, and a drop of oil in the bottle; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son, so that we may have a meal before our death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.13'>Elijah said to her: »Have no fear. Go and do as you said, but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me. Then make something for yourself and your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.14'>»For this is the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel: Your supply of meal will not come to an end. The bottle will never be without oil, till the day when Jehovah sends rain on the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.15'>She did as Elijah told her and they all had food for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.16'>The store of meal did not come to an end. The bottle was never without oil. This was just as Jehovah said through the mouth of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.17'>After this the son of the woman of the house became ill. He was so ill that there was no breath in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.18'>She said to Elijah: »What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to put God in mind of my sin, and to put my son to death?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.19'>He said: »Give your son to me.« And lifting him out of her arms, he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.20'>Crying to Jehovah he said: »O Jehovah my God, have you sent evil even on the widow I now visit, by causing her son's death?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.21'>Stretching himself out on the child three times, he made his prayer to Jehovah. He said: »O Jehovah my God, be pleased to let this child's life come back to him again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.22'>Jehovah listened to the voice of Elijah. The child began to breath and came back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.17.23'>Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother. »See, your son is alive.« He said.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.18'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.1'>After a long time, the word of Jehovah came to Elijah. In the third year he said: »Go and let Ahab see you. I will send rain on the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.2'>So Elijah went to let Ahab see him. There was no food to be had in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.3'>Ahab sent for Obadiah, the controller of the king's house. Obadiah had great respect for Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.4'>When Jezebel massacred the prophets of Jehovah, Obadiah took a hundred of them, and hid them secretly in a hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.5'>Ahab said to Obadiah: »Come! Let us go through all the country, to all the fountains of water and all the rivers. Let us see if there is any grass for the horses and the transport beasts. We must save some of the livestock.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.6'>They went through all the country by dividing it between them. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.7'>While Obadiah was on his way, he came face to face with Elijah. Seeing who it was, he went down on his face and said: »Is it you, my lord Elijah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.8'>Elijah answered: »It is I. Go tell your lord Elijah is here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.9'>He said: »What sin have I done that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.12'>»What if the Spirit of Jehovah carries you off to some unknown place as soon as I leave? Then, when I tell Ahab that you are here and he cannot find you, he will put me to death. Remember that I have been a devout worshiper of Jehovah ever since I was a boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>»Have you not heard that when Jezebel was killing Jehovahs prophets I hid a hundred of them in caves, in two groups of fifty, and supplied them with food and water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>»So how can you order me to go and tell the king that you are here? He will kill me!«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>So Obadiah went to Ahab and gave him the news. Ahab went to see Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>Ahab saw Elijah. He said: »Is it you, Israels troublemaker?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.18'>Then he said in answer: »I have not made trouble for Israel. You and your family have. You have disobeyed Jehovahs commands and have gone after the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.19'>»Now gather all Israel together before me at Mount Carmel. Also gather the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebel's table.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.20'>So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and assembled the prophets together at Mount Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>Elijah came near to all the people and said: »How long will you balance bounce back and forth between two opinions? If Jehovah is God, then give worship to him. If Baal is, give worship to him.« The people did not answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>Then Elijah said to the people: »I, even I, am the only living prophet of Jehovah but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>»Let them give us two bulls. Let them take one for themselves and have it cut up, and put it on the wood, but put no fire under it. I will get the other bull ready, and put it on the wood, and put no fire under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>»You pray to your god and I will pray to Jehovah. The God who answers with fire is God!« All the people answered: »It is well said.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>So they took the bull that was given them, and made it ready. They cried out to Baal from morning till the middle of the day. They said: »O Baal, give ear to us.« But there was no voice and no answer. They jumped up and down before the altar they had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>In the middle of the day, Elijah made sport of them, saying: »Give louder cries, for he is a god; he may be deep in thought. He may have gone away for some purpose. Perhaps he is on a journey. By chance he is sleeping and must be woke up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>So they gave loud cries and they cut themselves with knives and swords till the blood came streaming out all over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>They went on with their prayers from midday till the time of the offering; but there was no voice, or any answer, or any who gave attention to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>Then Elijah said to all the people: »Come near to me.« Then all the people came near. He repaired the altar of Jehovah that was broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>Elijah took twelve stones, the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah said: »Israel will be your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>He used the stones to make an altar to the name of Jehovah. He dug a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two seahs of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>He put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on there. Then he said: Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood. Do it a second time, and they did it a second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>Then he said: »Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood. Do it a second time« They did it a second time. Then he said: »Do it a third time« and they did it a third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>The water went all round the altar until the drain was full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>Then at the time of the offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, »Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things by your order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>»Give me an answer, O Jehovah. Give me an answer so that this people may see that you are God. That you have made their hearts come back again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of Jehovah came down. It burned up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and drinking up the water in the drain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>When the people saw it, they all went down on their faces. They said: »Jehovah is God! Jehovah is God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>Elijah said to them: »Take the prophets of Baal. Do not let one of them get away.« So they took them, and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon, and executed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>Then Elijah said to Ahab: »Get up and take food and drink, for there is a sound of much rain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>So Ahab went up to have food and drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel. He bowed down to the earth and put his face between his knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>He told his servant to look in the direction of the sea. After he looked the servant said: »There is nothing.« Elijah said: »Go again seven times.« So he went seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>The seventh time he said: »I see a cloud coming up out of the sea, as small as a man's hand.« Then Elijah said: »Go up and say to Ahab, Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>After a very little time, the heaven became black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>The hand of Jehovah was on Elijah. Jehovah gave special strength to Elijah and he ran ahead of Ahab until they came to Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.3'>Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He took his servant and went to Beersheba in Judah. He left the servant there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.4'>Elijah walked a whole day into the wilderness. He stopped and sat down under a broom plant and wished he would die. »It is just too much, Jehovah,« he prayed. »Take away my life. I could just as well be dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.5'>Stretching himself on the earth, he went to sleep under the broom-plant. An angel touched him and said: »Get up and eat some food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.6'>Looking up, he saw near his head a cake cooked on coals and a bottle of water. So he ate food and drink water and went to sleep again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.7'>The angel of Jehovah came again a second time, and touched him and said: »Get up and have some food, or you will not have strength for the journey.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.8'>So he got up and took food and drink. He was strengthened to go for forty days and forty nights, to Horeb, the mountain of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.9'>He went into a cave and spent the night. The word of Jehovah came to him, saying: »What are you doing here, Elijah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.10'>He said: »I have been zealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. The children of Israel have not kept your agreement covenant. They have destroyed your altars. They killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I, am the only one living. Now they seek to take my life too.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.11'>Then he said: »Go out and take your place on the mountain before Jehovah.« Jehovah passed by and the force of a great wind parted the mountains. Rocks were broken before Jehovah but Jehovah was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.12'>After the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sounds of a soft breathe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.13'>Elijah heard it and went out covering his face with his robe. He stood by the entrance of the cave. He heard a voice saying: »What are you doing here, Elijah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.14'>He replied: »I have been very zealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. The children of Israel have not kept your agreement. They have torn down your altars. They killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I, am the only one living. Now they seek to take my life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.15'>Jehovah said to him: »Go back on your way through the wasteland to Damascus.« When you get there, put holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.16'>»And also anoint Jehu, son of Nimshi, making him king over Israel; and Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, to be prophet in your place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.17'>»Whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death. Whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.18'>»I will leave seven thousand people alive in Israel; all those who are loyal to me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.19'>Elijah left there and found Elisha plowing with a team of bulls. There were eleven teams ahead of him. He was plowing with the last one. Elijah took off his cloak and put it on Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.20'>Elisha then left his bulls and ran after Elijah. He said: »Let me kiss my father and mother good-bye and then I will go with you.« Elijah answered, »All right, go back. I am not stopping you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.21'>Then Elisha went to his team of bulls, killed them, and cooked the meat. He used the yoke as fuel for the fire. He gave the meat to the people, and they ate it. Then he followed Elijah as his helper.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.1'>King Benhadad of Syria mustered his entire army, accompanied by thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots, he laid siege on Samaria, and launched attacks against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.2'>He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel to say: »King Benhadad demands that</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.3'>you surrender to him your silver and gold, your women and the strongest of your children.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.4'>Tell my lord, King Benhadad, that I agree; he can have everything I own, Ahab answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.5'>Later the messengers came back to Ahab with another demand from Benhadad: »I sent you word that you were to hand over to me your silver and gold, your women and your children.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.6'>Now I will send my officers to search your palace and the homes of your officials. They will take everything they consider valuable. They will be there about this time tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.7'>Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land, and said: »Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man. He sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, and I did not keep them back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.8'>All the responsible men and the people said to him: »Do not pay attention to him or do what he says.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.9'>So he said to the representatives of Benhadad: »Say to my lord the king: All the orders you sent the first time I will do. But I will not do this thing.« The representatives went back with this answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.10'>Benhadad sent Ahab the following message: »May the gods strike me dead if there will be enough dust left from Samaria to give a handful to each soldier who follows me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.11'>The king of Israel responded: »It is said, let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.12'>Benhadad heard this when he and his allies were drinking in their tents. He told his officers to get ready. So they got prepared to attack the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.13'>A prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said: »This is what Jehovah says: Have you seen this large army? I will hand it over to you today. Then you will know that I am Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.14'>Ahab asked: »How will this be done?« The prophet answered: »This is what Jehovah says: By using the young officers of the district governors.« »Who will start the battle?« Ahab asked. »You will,« the prophet answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.15'>Ahab mustered the young officers of the district governors. There were two hundred and thirty-two. After counting them, he counted all the Israelite soldiers. There were seven thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.16'>In the middle of the day they went out. But Benhadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.17'>The servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first. Benhadad sent out a patrol and they told him: »Men have come out from Samaria.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.18'>He said: »If they have come out for peace, take them alive and if they have come out for war, take them alive.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.19'>So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town, with the army following them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.20'>Each one killed his opponent. The Syrians Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them. Benhadad the king of Aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.21'>The king of Israel took the horses and the war-carriages and caused great destruction among the Syrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.22'>Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel, and said: »Now make yourself strong. Be careful what you do. Otherwise a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.23'>Then the king of Aram's servants said to him: »Their god is a god of the hills. That is why they were stronger than us. If we attack them in the lowlands, we will certainly be stronger than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.24'>»This is what you must do: take the kings from their positions, and put captains in their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.25'>»Assemble another army like the one that was destroyed. Horse for horse, and carriage for carriage let us make war on them in the lowlands, and certainly we will be stronger than they.« He listened and did what was suggested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.26'>So, a year later, Benhadad got the Syrians Aramaeans together and went to Aphek to make war on Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.27'>And the children of Israel assembled, and food was made ready and they went against them. The children of Israel camped like two little flocks of goats before them. All the country was full of the Syrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.28'>A man of God came to the king of Israel. He said: »Jehovah says, Because the Aramaeans have said, »Jehovah is a god of the hills and not of the valleys; I will give all this great army into your hands, and you will see that I am Jehovah.« «</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.29'>The two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days. The seventh day the fight was started. The children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.30'>The rest went in flight to Aphek, into the town, where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living. Benhadad went in flight into the town, into an inner room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.31'>His servants said to him: »It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy: let us then put on haircloth, and cords on our heads, and go to the king of Israel. Maybe he will give you your life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.32'>So they put on haircloth, and cords on their heads, and went to the king of Israel and said: »Your servant Benhadad says: Let me now keep my life.« And he said: »Is he still living? He is my brother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.33'>Now the men took it as a sign, and were quick to pick up on his word. They said: »Benhadad is your brother.« Then he said: »Go and get him.« So Ben-hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.34'>Benhadad said: »The towns my father took from your father I will give back. You may name streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria.« As for me, at the price of this agreement you will let me go. So he made an agreement with him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.35'>A man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbors by the word of Jehovah: »Give me a wound.« But the man would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.36'>Then he said: »Because you have not listened to the voice of Jehovah, immediately after you leave me a lion will kill you.« When he went away a lion came rushing at him and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.37'>Then he came across another man, and said: »Give me a wound.« And the man gave him a blow wounding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.38'>So the prophet went away, and pulling his headband over his eyes to keep his face covered. He took his place by the road waiting for the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.39'>When the king went by he cried out to him: »Your servant went out into the fight. A man came to me. He brought a man to me and said: guard this man. Do not let him get away. Your life is the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.40'>»But while your servant was turning this way and that, he was gone. Then the king of Israel said to him: You are responsible; you have given the decision against yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.41'>He quickly took the headband from his eyes. The king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.42'>He said to him: »These are the words of Jehovah: Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.43'>Then the king of Israel went back to his house, bitter and angry, he went to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.1'>Naboth the Jezreelite had a garden in Jezreel, near the house of Ahab, king of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.2'>Ahab said to Naboth: »Give me your garden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants. Since it is near my house let me give you a better vine-garden in exchange. If it seems good to you, let me give you its value in money.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.3'>But Naboth said to Ahab, »God forbid that I give you the heritage of my fathers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.4'>Ahab returned to his house bitter and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite said to him: »I will not give you the heritage of my fathers.« Stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away, he would not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>Jezebel his wife came to him and asked: »Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>He replied: »I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite. I said to him: Let me have your garden for money, or, if it pleases you, I will give you another garden for it. But he said: »I will not give you my garden.« «</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>Then his wife Jezebel said: »Are you now the ruler of Israel? Get up, eat and be happy. I will give you the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she sent a letter in Ahab's name, stamped with his stamp, to the elders and nobles who were in authority with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>The letter she wrote is as follows: »Let a time of public sorrow be fixed, and put Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>»Get two good-for-nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king. Then take him out and have him stoned to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>So the elders and nobles in authority in his town did as Jezebel said in the letter she sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They gave orders for a day of public sorrow and put Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>The two good-for-nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against Naboth, in front of the people. They said: »Naboth has been cursing God and the king.« Then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying: »Naboth has been stoned and is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>Jezebel, hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, said to Ahab: »Get up and take as your heritage the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he would not give you for money. Naboth is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>When he heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab went down to the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite to take it as his heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>»Go to Ahab, king of Israel, in Samaria. He is in the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite. He went there to take it as his heritage.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>»Say to him: Jehovah says: »Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage?« « »Then say: Jehovah says: »Your blood will become the drink of dogs! You will go to the same place where the dogs drink the blood of Naboth.« «</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>Ahab said to Elijah: »Have you come face to face with me, O my enemy?« Elijah said: »I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Jehovah says to you: »I will bring disaster on you. I will do away with you and get rid of every male in your family, young and old alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>»Your family will become like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah. This is because you have stirred up my anger by leading Israel into sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>No one else devoted himself so completely to doing wrong in Jehovahs sight as Ahab all at the urging of his wife Jezebel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols the way the Amorites had done. Jehovah drove the Amorites from the land as the people of Israel advanced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>Elijah finished speaking. Ahab tore his clothes and took them off. He dressed in sackcloth. He refused food fasted and slept in the sackcloth. He was gloomy and depressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>Jehovah said to the prophet Elijah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>»Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has done this, I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime. It will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>There was peace between Israel and Syria for the next two years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>Ahab asked Jehoshaphat: »Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?« »I am ready when you are,« Jehoshaphat answered. »And so are my soldiers and my cavalry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>»First let us inquire of Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them: »Should I attack Ramoth, or not?« They answered: »Attack, Jehovah will give you victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>Jehoshaphat asked: »Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>Ahab answered: »There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, always something bad.« »The king should not say such things!« Jehoshaphat replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then Ahab called a court official and told him to get Micaiah at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>They dressed in their royal robes and sat on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria. The two kings listened to all the prophets prophesy in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab: »Jehovah says: With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>All the other prophets said the same thing: »March against Ramoth and you will win,« they said. »Jehovah will give you victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>The messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him: »All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king. You had better do the same.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>Micaiah answered: »By the living God Jehovah I promise that I will say what he tells me to say!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>He appeared before King Ahab. The king asked him: »Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack!« Micaiah answered. »You will win. Jehovah will give you victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>But Ahab replied: »Tell the truth when you speak to me in the name of Jehovah! How many times do I have to tell you that?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>Micaiah answered: »I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd.« Jehovah said: »These men have no leader. Let them go home in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>Israels king said to Jehoshaphat: »Did I not say to you, He will prophesy about me? It is always something bad!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>Micaiah continued: »Now listen to what Jehovah says! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>Jehovah asked: »Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and be killed at Ramoth? Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>until a spirit stepped forward, approached Jehovah,« and said: »I will deceive him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>»How will you deceive him?« Jehovah asked. The spirit replied: »I will make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.« Jehovah said: »Go and deceive him. You will succeed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Micaiah concluded: This is what has happened. Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you. He has decreed that you will meet with disaster!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>The prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and slapped his face. He asked: »Since when did Jehovahs spirit leave me and speak to you?«</verse>
