        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>»I will use my power against Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will destroy followers of Baal in this place. I will remove the names of the pagan idolatrous priests along with my priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>»I will remove those who bow down to worship the host of heaven on the housetops and those who bow down and swear to Jehovah and yet swear by Malcolm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>»The same for those who have turned back from following Jehovah, and those who have not sought Jehovah or inquired of Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah! For the day of Jehovah is near! Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice. He has sanctified His guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>»On that day of Jehovahs sacrifice,« said Jehovah, »I will punish the officials, the king's sons, and all who practice foreign customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>»I will punish all who worship false gods and who steal and kill in order to fill their master's house with violence.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>»On that day,« said Jehovah, »you will hear the sound of crying at the Fish Gate in Jerusalem. You will hear wailing in the newer part of the city and a loud crash from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>»Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh! The people of Canaan have perished. Those wealthy with silver will be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>»At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps. I will punish the men that are satisfied with their wayward lifestyle. They say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good and he will not do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>»Their wealth will be looted. Their homes will be demolished. They will build houses. However they will not live in them! They will plant vineyards. But they will not drink their wine!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>»The great Day of Jehovah is near. It is near and coming quickly. Listen! The mighty man will cry out bitterly on the Day of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>»That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish. That day will be a day of trouble, devastation and desolation! It will be a day of darkness and gloom. Indeed that day will be a day of clouds and overcast skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>»That day will be a day of alarm signals and battle cries against the fortified cities and against the high corner towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>»I will bring distress on humans and they will walk like they are blind! They have sinned against Jehovah! Their blood will be poured out like dust and their intestines like manure.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Come together, make everyone come together, you nation without shame!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>Before the decree takes effect. Before the day passes like the chaff. Before the fierce anger of Jehovah comes upon you. Yes, before the Day of Jehovah's anger comes upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek Jehovah all you meek ones of the earth, you who have obeyed his Law! Seek righteousness! Seek meekness that you may be hidden in the Day of Jehovah's anger. Hebrew: ulay-ulay, may-be; Septuagint: »you may be hid.« Hebrew: sathar: concealed, hidden, protected (Zephaniah 1:2) (Amos 5:15)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For Gaza will be abandoned. Ashkelon will be a desolate waste. They will drive out Ashdod at high noon. Ekron will be exterminated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>»Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you and you will not be inhabited.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>»The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will feed their flocks there. They will rest at night in the houses of Ashkelon. Jehovah their God will visit them and gather back the captive ones.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>»I have heard the reproach of Moab and the taunting by the children of Ammon. They have reproached my people. They behave arrogantly at the border.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>»Just as I live,« said Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, »Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah.

        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>»They will have this instead of their pride. This is because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>»Jehovah will fill them with fear for he will starve emaciate all the gods of the earth! Men will worship him, each one from his place, even the coastlands of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>»You Ethiopians Cushites will be slain by my sword!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>»He will stretch out his hand exercise his power against the north, and destroy Assyria. He will make Nineveh a desolation. It will be barren like the desert wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.14'>»And herds will lie down in her midst, all the beasts of the nations. The pelican and the porcupine will lodge on the top of her pillars. Their voice will sing hootcroak in the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds for he will lay bare that which is built with cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>»This is the joyous city that dwelled in security. She said in her heart, I am! There is no one else! She has become an object of desolation, a place for wild animals to lie down in. Every one who passes by her will hiss, and wag his hand.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Woe to the oppressive city for she is rebellious and polluted defiled!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She did not obey the voice of Jehovah. She would not accept correction discipline. She did not trust Jehovah and draw close to her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her princes rulers within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing till the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets are insolent and treacherous persons. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary! They have done violence to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>Jehovah is righteous within her. He will do no wrong. He brings justice to the dawn of the morning. He does not fail! Yet the unjust know no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>»I have destroyed nations! Their battlements are completely destroyed! I have made their streets waste so that none pass by. I destroyed the people and the cities so that there is no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>»I said, show me respect and receive discipline instructioncorrection! That way she would not loose her dwelling. This is according to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds.«</verse>

I will assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them my indignation, even all my fierce anger! All the earth will be devoured with the fire of my zeal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>»I will give the peoples a pure language. They may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him united in total agreement and purpose shoulder to shoulder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.20'>»At that time I will bring you in! At that time I will gather you together. I will give you a name honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth! This will happen when I gather back your captive ones before your very eyes,« declares Jehovah.</verse>
