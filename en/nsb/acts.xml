      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Luke) (61 C.E.) (Rome)</title>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The first account I composed, O Theophilus, was about all that Jesus did and taught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until the day he was received up to heaven. After that he gave orders through the Holy Spirit to his chosen apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>He presented himself alive to them after his suffering. He gave many convincing proofs. He appeared to them during forty days speaking about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>When they were gathered together he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem. They were to wait for the promise of the Father that he spoke about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>»John baptized with water; but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days,« He said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>When they met they asked him: »Lord will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He replied: »It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has set within His own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>»You will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When he said these things, while they watched, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>They gazed intently into the sky as he went into heaven. Two men wearing white stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>They said: »You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven will come in a similar manner as you saw him go into heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath days journey away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they entered the city they went to the upper chamber where they were staying. Included were Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealous one, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>They all continued united in earnest prayer. The women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers were also there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>In these days Peter stood up among the brothers about a hundred and twenty, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>»Brothers, the Scripture needed to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>»He was numbered among us, and shared in this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>»This man obtained a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open and all his intestines spilled out. Matthew 27:5 says he hanged himself. The rope broke or the branch on which it was tied broke. Then he fell to the ground and burst open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>»It became known to all who live in Jerusalem that the field was called the field of blood, in their language; Akeldama.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>»It is written in the book of Psalms: Let his habitation be made desolate and let no man dwell there. Let another take his office. (Psalm 109:8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>»Someone must join us as a witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. He must be one of the men who were in our group during the time that the Lord Jesus traveled about with us. This should be from the time John preached his message of baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>»One who was with us from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us must become a witness with us of his resurrection.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>They proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>They prayed: »You O Jehovah, know the hearts of all men. Show us which of these men you choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>»Which of these men should assume this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>They cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias. So he was included with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>Suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind. It filled the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>Tongues of fire that sat on each of them appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak with different tongues, as the Spirit moved them to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Devout Jews from every nation under heaven were dwelling at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>When they heard this sound a crowd came together in confusion, because men heard them speak in their own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were all amazed and marveled. They said to each other: »Behold, are not all these that speak Galileans?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>»How do we each hear them in our own language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>»Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>»Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>»Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our language the wonderful works of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed and were in doubt. They asked each other: »What does this mean?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Others mockingly said: »These men are full of new wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them: »You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem let me explain this to you. Listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>»These men are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>»This is what the prophet Joel spoke about:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>»It will come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. Greek: apo, from Your sons and your daughters will prophesy proclaim Gods Word. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>»And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out a portion fromsome of my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy: (Joel 2:28)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>»I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>»The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable awesome Day of Jehovah arrives. (Joel 2:31)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>»It will come to pass, that whoever will call on the name of Jehovah will be saved. (Joel 2:32)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>»You men of Israel hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God came among you with miracles and wonders and signs. God did these by him in your midst, as you also know:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>»You took this man and delivered him by the determined counsel purpose and foreknowledge of God. With wicked hands you impaled and murdered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>»God resurrected him, loosing the pains of death. This is because it was not possible that he should be held fast by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>»David spoke concerning him: I had Jehovah always before my face, for he is at my right hand, that I should not be shaken. (Psalm 16:8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>»Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>»Because you will not leave me in the grave, neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption. (Psalm 16:10)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>»You have made known to me the ways of life, and you will fill me with joy with your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>»Men and brothers let me freely speak to you about the patriarch David that he is dead and buried. His grave is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>»Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>»He seeing this before spoke about the resurrection of Christ. That he would not be left in the grave and his flesh did not see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>»God resurrected Jesus and we all witnessed this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>« He is exalted to the right hand of God. He has received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father. So he poured out what you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>»For David has not ascended into heaven and yet he said: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>»until I make your enemies your footstool. (Psalm 110:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>»Therefore let all the house of Israel know for sure that God has made that same Jesus, whom you impaled, both Lord and Christ.« (Acts 10:36)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: »Men and brothers, what shall we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Then Peter said: »Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>»The promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as Jehovah our God calls.« (Micah 4:5) (Deuteronomy 6:4)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>He gave a thorough witness with many words and exhorted them, saying: »Save yourselves from this indecent generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Those who gladly received his word were baptized. About three thousand persons were added the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They continued devoting themselves to doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Every person experienced a sense of awe, for the apostles did many wonders and signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All those who believed stayed together. They held all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>They continued daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house. They ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>As they praised God, they had favor with all the people. God added to the congregation daily those being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Peter and John went up to the temple at the hour of prayer. It was the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>A man who had been crippled from birth was carried to the gate of the temple called Beautiful. There he begged for handouts from those who entered the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he begged from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter and John looked at him and said: »Look at us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>He looked at them expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then Peter said: »We have no money but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>He took him by the right hand, and lifted him up. Immediately his feet and anklebones received strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>He leaped up, stood and walked. He entered the temple with them walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>They knew he was the one who begged at the Beautiful gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement because of what happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>The beggar held on to Peter and John while all the people came to them at the place called Solomons Colonnade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When Peter saw this he spoke to the people: »You men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you look at us as though our own power or holiness made this man walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>»The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus. You handed him over to Pilate. When he was determined to let him go you denied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>»You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and requested a murderer to be released to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>»You killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead. We witnessed this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>»This man you see and know was made strong by his faith in the name of Jesus. His faith has given him total healing in your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>»Brothers, I know you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>»The things God fulfilled he announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>»Repent therefore, and turn around, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times seasons of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah. (Deuteronomy 18:18, 19)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>»He will send Jesus Christ, who preached to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things. God spoke about this through all his holy prophets since the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>»Moses said to the fathers, Jehovah will raise up for your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to all the things he speaks to you. (Deuteronomy 18:18)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>»It will happen. Every person who will not listen to the prophet will be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>»Yes, all the prophets from Samuel and his successors also announced these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>»You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with our fathers. He said to Abraham: All the families of the earth will be blessed in your seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>»God raised up his servant and sent him to you first. He sent him to bless you and to turn every one of you from your wicked ways.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>As they spoke to the people, the chief priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>They were annoyed because they taught the people through Jesus. They preached the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>Many who heard the word believed. There were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next morning their rulers, elders, scribes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>They stood them in their presence and asked: »By what power or by what name do you do this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said: »You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>»If we are on trial for a good deed done to a sick man, concerning how this man was made well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>»Let it be known to you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you impaled and whom God raised from the dead, even by him this man stands before you healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>»This is the stone that was rejected by you builders. It became the chief corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>»There is no salvation in anyone else. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>They observed the confidence of Peter and John. Yet they thought they were uneducated not formally educated and ordinary men. They were amazed and recognized them as having been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>They ordered them to leave the council. Then they conferred among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>They said: »What shall we do to these men? The fact that a notable miracle has been done by them is evident to all who live in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>»We must warn these men not to speak about it in order to stop this from spreading further among the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>Peter and John answered: »You judge whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>»We cannot stop speaking the things we have seen and heard.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>When they further threatened them, they let them go. They found no basis for punishment because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>The man who received the miracle of healing was about forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>Being released, they went to their own and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>When they heard they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said: »Jehovah, you are God, who made heaven and earth, the sea and all in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>»You spoke by the mouth of your servant David: Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? (Psalm 2:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>»The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against Jehovah, and against his Christ. (Psalm 2:2)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>Truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the people of the nations and the people of Israel, were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>»They were there to do the things your hand and council foreordained to occur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>»Now Jehovah behold their threats and grant that your servants keep speaking your word with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>»You extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders appear in the name of your holy servant Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they prayed, the place where they assembled together was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>The congregation that believed was of one heart and mind. No one claimed his or her own possessions for everything was common property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>The apostles witnessed about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. Grace Gods loving kindness was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>There was no needy person among them for as many as possessed land or houses sold them, and brought the money from the things that were sold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>They gave it to the apostles. Distribution was made to every man according as he had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, this meaning: The son of consolation, was a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>He sold his land and brought the money to the apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Saul got up from the ground. Even though he opened his eyes, he saw nothing. They led him by the hand into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>He went for three days without sight. He did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>The disciple Ananias was in Damascus. The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision: »Ananias.« He replied: »Yes, I am here, Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said to him, »Arise, and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>»He has seen a man named Ananias in a vision. He came in and laid his hand on him that he might receive his sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>Ananias answered: »Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your holy ones at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>»He has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>The Lord said to him: »Be on your way. This man is a chosen vessel to bear my name to the people of the nations, and kings and the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>»I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Ananias went his way. He entered the house and put his hands on him and said, »Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you along the road sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he received sight. He got up and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>He ate and was strengthened. Saul spent several days with the disciples at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>He preached in the synagogues immediately. He preached Christ the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All who heard him were amazed. They asked: »Is he the one who raised havoc with those who called on this name in Jerusalem? Did he come for that purpose to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>Saul increased in power and confounded the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>After many days the Jews took counsel to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>Saul learned about their plot against him. They watched the gates day and night to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>During the night the disciples let him down by the wall in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When Saul came to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples. They were afraid of him and did not believe he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>Barnabas led him to the apostles. He declared to them how he had seen the Lord in The Way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>He was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He had a dispute with the Greek speaking Jews and they made attempts to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When the brothers detected this they brought him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>The congregations throughout all Judea, Galilee and Samaria, were built up. They walked in deep respect for Jehovah and were comforted by the Holy Spirit and continued to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Peter traveled through all parts. He came to the holy ones at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>He found a man named Aeneas who lay in his bed for eight years. He was sick of the palsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him: « Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole! Stand up and take your bed.« And he stood up immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>All who lived at Lydda on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>A disciple named Tabitha was at Joppa. Her name, when translated means Dorcas. This woman did many good works and gave gifts of mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>She was sick, and died. They washed her body and laid her in an upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him requesting that he come to them quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Peter went to them right a way. When he arrived they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter put them all outside, kneeled down, and prayed. He turned to the body and said: »Tabitha, rise!« She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>He gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then he called the holy ones and widows and presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>It became known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>He waited many days in Jappa with Simon a tanner.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a devout man who respected God with his entire household. He gave many gifts of mercy to the people and prayed to God always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw a vision. An angel of God came to him and said, »Cornelius.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>He looked at him and was afraid. »What is it, Lord?« He replied. The angel said: »God hears your prayers and sees your gifts of mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>»Send men to Joppa to bring back Simon, whose surname is Peter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>»He is staying with a tanner named Simon whose house is by the sea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was his attendant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>He told them what happened and sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>The next day they journeyed to the city. As they drew near, Peter went to the housetop to pray. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He became very hungry. While the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>He saw heaven opened, something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners was descending to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>Peter heard a voice say: »Kill and eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said: »No Lord for I have never eaten any thing that is defiled or unclean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>The voice spoke to him again the second time: »You stop calling defiled that which God has cleansed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened a third time and immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>While Peter doubted in himself what this vision ment, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius inquired for Simons house, and stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>They called out and asked if Simon surnamed Peter lived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him: « Behold, three men seek you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>»Stand up and go down to greet them. Do not doubt for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius. He said: »I am the one you are looking for. Why did you come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They said: »We come from Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man who respects God. He has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so he could hear what you have to say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>He invited them in to be his guests. The next day Peter went away with them. Brothers accompanied them from Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>The day after that they entered Caesarea. Cornelius expected them so he called his relatives and close friends to join him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>Cornelius met Peter and fell down at his feet with adoration for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>»Stand up,« Peter said, as he lifted him up, »I am also a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>He talked with him and went in to find many people gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He said to them: »You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company, or approach someone of another nation. But God revealed to me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>»Therefore I came to you without objection, as soon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent you sent for me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius replied, »Four days ago I was praying at this hour. It was the ninth hour and I prayed in my house. A man dressed in bright clothing stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>»He said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your gifts of mercy are noticed in the sight of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Peter opened his mouth, and said, »I truly perceive that God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>»In every nation he accepts every person who respects him and does what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>»You know the Word of God was sent to the children of Israel. He Jehovah God presented peace through the anointed Lord or Master of all, Jesus Christ. (Acts 2:36) (Jesus identified his father, Jehovah God, as Lord of all heaven and earth at Matthew 11:25)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>»You know that message which began in Galilee and was published throughout all Judea, after the baptism that John preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil. God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>»We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a stake.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>»However, all the people did not see him. Witnesses who were previously chosen by God saw him. We who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>»He commanded us to preach to the people. We testify that he was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>Holy Spirit descended on all who heard the message Peter spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>Those circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of Holy Spirit was also poured out on the people of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>They heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then Peter responded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>»Can any man keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit as we have.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>They said: »You went to the uncircumcised and ate with them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Peter started at the beginning and explained what happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>»I was in the city of Joppa praying. In a trance I saw a vision. A vessel descended like a great sheet. It let down from heaven by four corners and it came to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>News of these things came to the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem. They sent Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them was named Agabus. He indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire earth. He said it would come to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>He saw that it pleased the Jews so he captured Peter also. This happened during the feast of unleavened bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>When he apprehended him, he put him in prison. He turned him over to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him. After Passover he would be presented to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Peter was kept in prison. Prayer was made without ceasing by the congregation to God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>It was the night before Herod was to bring him to trial. Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was bound with two chains. Sentries stood guard at the prison door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>Suddenly Gods angel came to him. A light shined in the prison. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up saying: »Get up quickly.« And his chains fell off of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>The angel said: »Dress yourself and put on sandals. Put on your coat and follow me.« So Peter did as he was told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>Peter followed him out of the prison. He did not know what the angel was doing was really happening. He thought he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>They went past the first and second guard to the Iron Gate that leads to the city. The gate opened and went out on the street. The angel then departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Peter came to himself and he said: »Now I know for sure that God sent his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>After he thought about what happened he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark. Many were gathered there to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>Peter knocked on the door and a young woman named Rhoda answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>When she recognized Peters voice she was so overjoyed she ran back into the house to tell others he was there. She forgot to open the door for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said to her: »You are mad.« But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said: »It must be his angel.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>Peter motioned for them to be quiet. Then he told them how God brought him out of the prison. He said: »Tell James and the brothers.« Then he went away to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>When day came the soldiers were disturbed by what happened to Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Herod had a thorough search made for him and could not find him. He cross examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Herod went from Judea to Caesarea to stay for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Herod highly disagreed with them at Tyre and Sidon. But they finally came to an agreement. They secured the support of Blastus a trusted personal servant of the king. They desired peace because their country was supported by the kings country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>Dressed in royal apparel, Herod delivered a public address to the people on a special day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people shouted: »It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Immediately the angel of God killed him, because he did not give God the glory. He was eaten by worms and died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>»Look Jehovahs hand is on you. You will be blind and not see the sun for a season.« Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness. He went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>When he saw what was done the deputy believed. He was astonished at the teaching of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Paul and his company put out to sea from Paphos. They went to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them to return to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted to have him travel with him. So he had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in the area. For they knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>The Jews were moved with jealousy so they gathered bad people who organized a crowd for a riot. They assaulted the house of Jason in order to bring them out to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>When they did not find them they dragged Jason and other brothers before the rulers of the city. They said: »These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>The Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. Some said: What is this babbler saying? Others: He seems to be advocating strange gods because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus. They said, »May we know what is this new teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>»You bring strange ideas to our ears. We want to know what these things mean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>The Athenians and the strangers who lived there spent their time doing nothing else except talking about and listening to new ideas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said: »Men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that you are very religious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>« As I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: »To An Unknown God.« What you worship as unknown, this I will proclaim to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>»The God that made the world and all things in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He does not live in temples made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>»Mens hands do not serve him as if he needed anything. He gives life and breath to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>»From one person he made every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth. He determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>»God did this so man could seek him and might find him. He is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>»In him we live, and move, and have our existence. Your own poets have said: For we are also his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>»Being then the offspring of God, we should not think that the divine being is like gold, or silver, or stone, a device made by mans design or skill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>»God overlooked the times of ignorance; but now he commands men everywhere to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>»He has established a day time in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man Jesus whom he has ordained. Of that he gives proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.« (John 5:22) (Isaiah 2:4) (Acts 10:42)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>Some mocked when they heard about the resurrection of the dead. Yet others said: »We will hear you again concerning this«.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>Thus Paul went out from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>Some men joined themselves to him and believed. Included among the believers were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>He was of the same trade as Paul. So he stayed with them and worked at their tentmaker trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia. He witnessed to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>When they opposed Paul and treated him abusively he shook out his garment and said to them: »Your blood is upon your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to the people of the nations.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>He left the synagogue and went next door to the house of a man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord and so did his household. Many of the Corinthians who heard and believed were baptized.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>He lived there a year and six months teaching the word of God to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>They said: »This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews: »If you Jews were about to complain about some crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>»But it involves questions about words and names in your own law so look to it yourselves. I will not be judge of these matters.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>He drove them from the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>They all grabbed Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the court. Gallio did not care about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul stayed many days. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria. Also with Paul were Priscilla and Aquila. Paul clipped this hair short in Cenchreae because of a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>They traveled to Ephesus where he left them. Paul entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they asked him to stay longer he declined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>»I will return again to you if it is Gods will,« Paul said. Then he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>When he landed at Caesarea, he greeted the congregation and traveled to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After spending some time there he departed through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was an Alexandrian who had a comprehensive knowledge of the scriptures and spoke eloquently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in Gods way. Being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He spoke boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him home and explained Gods word more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>When he decided to travel to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him. They wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived he was a great help to those who by grace believed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>Paul asked: »What kind of baptism did you get?« They replied: »It was the baptism John taught.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Paul said: »John baptized with the baptism of repentance. He told the people they should believe in Jesus, the one who came after John.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>Paul laid his hands on them and Holy Spirit came upon them. They spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>There were twelve men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly reasoning and persuading about the kingdom of God. He did this for three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>Some were obstinate and publicly maligned The Way before the crowds. He departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This continued for two years so that all who lived in this part of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God did special miracles by the hands of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were put on the sick and the evil spirits went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Some Jews went around driving out evil spirits saying: »In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, and a chief priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>The evil spirit answered and said to them: »Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them, and overpowered them. He gave them such a beating that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>This became known to all both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They were all afraid. The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many of the believers confessed openly about the evil things they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they totaled the value of them it came to about fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>»There is danger that our trade will lose its good name. The temple of the great goddess Artemis Diana would then become useless. The goddess who is worshiped in all Asia would be robbed of her divine majesty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>When they heard this they were filled with anger. They shouted: »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The city was filled with the confusion. They rushed with one accord into the theatre and seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Pauls companions in travel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>They perceived that he was a Jew and all with one voice shouted for two hours: »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>The city recorder quieted the crowd. He said: »You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>»Seeing that these things are indisputable it is fitting that you keep calm and do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>»You brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>»If Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a grievance against any man, the courts are open, and there are judges. Let them accuse one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, »Might I say something to you?« He replied: »Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>»Are you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand assassins into the desert?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, »I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city and I request that you allow me to speak to the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>The commander gave permission so Paul stood on the stairs, motioned to the people. When there was silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>»Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>They heard him speak in the Hebrew tongue and became quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>»I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up here in Jerusalem as a student of Gamaliel. I received instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as zealous for God as are all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>»I persecuted the people who followed this Way to the point of death. I arrested men and women and threw them into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>»The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth. I received letters from them written to fellow Jews in Damascus, so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>»While I was traveling I came near Damascus about midday. Suddenly a bright light from the sky flashed around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>»I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>»Who are you, Lord?« I asked. »I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute,« he said to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>»Everyone with me saw the light. They did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>»I asked: What shall I do, Lord? He said: Go to Damascus. There you will be told what God wants you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>»I was blind because of the bright light. So my companions took me by the hand and led me to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>»A man named Ananias was in that city. He is a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>»He came and stood by me, and said: Brother Saul, see again! At that very moment I saw again and looked at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>»He said: The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will. You are to see his righteous servant, and to hear him speak with his own voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>You will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>Wait no longer! Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>»I went back to Jerusalem. Then I have a vision while I prayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>»I saw the Lord. He said to me: Hurry and leave Jerusalem because the people here will not accept your witness about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>»I answered, Lord they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>»When your witness Stephen was put to death, I was there, approving of his murder and taking care of the coats of his murderers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>»The Lord said: Go! I will send you far away to the people of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>The people listened to Paul until he said this. Then they shouted at the top of their voices: »Away with him! Kill him! He is not fit to live!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>They were screaming, throwing off their clothes, and throwing dust up in the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the barracks. He told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>When they tied him up to be whipped Paul said to the officer standing there, »Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who has not been tried for a crime?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked him: »What are you doing? That man is a Roman citizen!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>The commander went to Paul and asked him: »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?« »Yes,« answered Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>The commander said: »I became one by paying a large amount of money.« »I am one by birth,« Paul answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him. The commander was frightened when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of. The next day he had Pauls chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet. Then he took Paul and made him stand before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Paul looked straight at the Council and said: »Fellow Israelites! My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Paul said to him: »God will strike you, white washed wall! Do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be struck?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>Those who stood near him said, »Do you revile the high priest of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then Paul said, »I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. It is written: You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>When Paul saw that part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin: »Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>When he said this dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The crowd was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit. The Pharisees believe both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>There arose a great cry. The scribes who were on the Pharisees side arose and spoke, »We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>The dispute became so violent the commander was afraid they would pull Paul to pieces. He commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>The following night the Lord stood by him and said: »Be of good courage, Paul, for just as you testified about me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>When day arrived some of the Jews came together and united with an oath saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty involved in this conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They went to the chief priests and elders and said: »We have united with a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>»Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, inform the commander that he bring him down to you tomorrow. You say you would inquire some more regarding him. We are ready to put him to death before he comes near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>Hearing about the ambush, Pauls sisters son entered the barracks and reported to Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Paul called one of the centurions and said: »Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>The officer took him to the commander, and said: »The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to say to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The commander took him by the hand and led him off by himself, and asked: »What do you have to tell me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>He said: »The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council. They want you to pretend the Council wants to get more accurate information about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>»Do not give in to them. There are more than forty men lying in wait for him. They are united with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready and looking for a promise from you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the commander sent the young man away commanding, »Tell no one that you have told these things to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>He called two centurions, saying, »Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea. Also prepare seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>»Claudius Lysias to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>»The Jews seized this man and were about to kill him. I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and rescued him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>»I took him to their council to find out of what they accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>»I found that he did not do a thing for which he deserved to die or be put in prison. The accusation against him had to do with questions about their own law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>»When I was informed that there was a plot against him, I decided to send him to you. I told his accusers to make their charges against him before you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>The soldiers carried out their orders. That night they took Paul as far as Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>They took him to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor. Then they turned Paul over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from. When he found out that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, »I will hear you fully when your accusers arrive.« He commanded him to be kept in the praetorian of Herod.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>After five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders. They brought an orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>Tertullus presented his case:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>»We have seen peace under your rule. Excellent accomplishments have come to this nation due to your forethought. We acknowledge this with profound gratitude, most excellent Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>»That I not hinder you more, I request that you to hear us briefly in fairness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>»We have found this man to be a troublemaker who stirs up sedition resists lawful authority among all the Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>»He even tried to desecrate the temple. So we captured him according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>»But the Roman commander Lysias came to us with the use of force and snatched him from our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>»He commanded his accusers to come to you. Examine him yourself and you will learn the truth about these charges we bring against him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews also joined in accusing him, saying that these things were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>The governor motioned for Paul to speak. He said, »I know that you have been a judge for this nation for many years. For this reason I cheerfully make my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>You can easily verify that it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to worship in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>»They did not find me in the Temple, in the synagogues nor in the city disputing with any man. Neither did I cause a riot with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>»Neither can they prove the things for which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>»This I confess to you that according to The Way, which they call a sect, I serve the God of our fathers. I believe all the things written in the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>»I have hope toward God, which they also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>»I exercise myself always, to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>»Now after many years I came to bring offerings and gifts of mercy to my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>»Some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple. There was neither crowd nor disturbance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>»They should have been here before you to testify against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>»Or let the men here say what wrong they found in me while I stood before the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>»Except for one utterance I cried out while standing among them. It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am called in question by you this day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>When Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them saying, »When Lysias the commander comes here I will decide your case.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He commanded a centurion to keep Paul. Allow him some freedom of custody and that some of his people should come and minister to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>A few days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>He reasoned about righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come. Felix trembled, and answered: »Go your way for now. When I have time I will send for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. He sent for him frequently and conversed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>After two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. Felix was willing to show the Jews a favor. He left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Three days after arriving in the province Festus ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>The high priest and Jewish leaders brought charges against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>They desired favor against him that he would transfer him to Jerusalem. Then they would ambush him along the way and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he would go there shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>He said: »Let those who have authority among you go there with me to present your case against this man if there is anything out of the way about the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>After he stayed there more than ten days, he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat in judgment. He commanded Paul be brought before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he arrived the Jews who also came there from Jerusalem presented many grievous complaints against Paul. They could not prove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul defended himself: »Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I committed any sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Festus was willing to do the Jews a favor, so he answered Paul: »Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>»I stand at Caesars court,« Paul replied, »where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you are finding out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>»If I am a wrongdoer, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if charges brought against me by the Jews are not true no man has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus conferred with his council and answered: »Have you appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>A few days later king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>While they were there Festus declared Pauls cause to the king. He said, »There is a man that Felix left a prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>»When I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him. They desire to have judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>»I told them it is not the Roman practice to deliver any man to die before his accusers face him. He should answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>»When they came before me, without any delay I sat in judgment, and commanded the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>»When the accusers took the stand they produced no charge of the wicked things I supposed about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>»They had questions against him about their own superstition. They had one about Jesus, who is dead, but Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>»Since I doubt such manner of questions, I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>»Paul appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus. So I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said to Festus: »I would also hear the man myself.« Festus replied: »Tomorrow, you will hear him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great elegance. They entered the place of hearing with the commanders and important men of the city. Festus gave the order for Paul to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Festus said, »King Agrippa and all men who are present with us, you see this man, about whom all the crowds of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he should not live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>»I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death. He has appealed to Augustus and I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>»I have no certain thing to write to my lord. I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination I might have something to write.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Agrippa said to Paul, »You are permitted to speak for yourself.« Then Paul stretched out his arm and began his defense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>»I would be happy, King Agrippa, to answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which the Jews accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>»I know you are an expert in all customs and controversy among the Jews. Therefore I urge you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>»All the Jews know the way I first lived as a youth among my own nation at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>»They knew me from the beginning. They could testify that I was from the strictest sect of our religion and I lived as a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>»Now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>»Our twelve tribes served God day and night with the promise and hope of what was to come. It is because of this hope that the Jews accuse me, King Agrippa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>»Why should it be an incredible thought to you that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>»I was convinced that I should oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>»That I did in Jerusalem. I locked up many of the holy ones in prison. I received authority from the chief priests and gave the command to put them to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>»King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said to Paul: »In a short time you would persuade convince me to become a Christian.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Paul replied, »I pray to God, that you and also all that hear me this day were altogether such as I am, except for these bonds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>When he finished speaking, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and all who sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>As they left they talked between themselves, saying, »This man does nothing worthy of death or of prison.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, »This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>When it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and other prisoners to a man named Julius, a centurion of the band of Augustus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>We entered a ship at Adramyttium and set sail. We intended to sail by the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we landed at Sidon. Julius treated Paul in a kind way and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>When we set sail from there we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>When we sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy. He put us on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>We sailed slowly for many days and had problems arriving off Cnidus. The wind did not allow us to hold our course. So we sailed to the downwind part of Crete near Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>It was difficult to move along the coast. We came to a place called Fair Havens near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>Much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous. Because the fast was over Paul admonished them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>»Men, I see that our voyage from here on will be dangerous. There will be great damage to the cargo and to the ship, and loss of life as well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the army officer was convinced by what the captain and the owner of the ship said, and not by what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>It was not a good harbor in which to spend the winter. Nearly everyone was in favor of putting out to sea and trying to reach Phoenix in order to spend the winter there. Phoenix is a harbor in Crete that faces southwest and northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>A gentle wind from the south began to blow. The men thought they could accomplish their plan. So they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>Soon a very strong northeast wind blew down from the island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>It hit the ship and it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind. We gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>We had shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda. There, with some difficulty we managed to make the ships boat secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship. They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks quicksand off the coast of Libya, so they lowered the sail and allowed the ship be carried by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>The violent storm continued. The next day they began to throw some of the ships cargo overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>The following day they threw part of the ships equipment overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>The sun and stars did not appear for many days. No small tempest pressed upon us. All hope of our being saved was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>After they spent a long time without eating Paul stood up and said: »Sirs, you should listen to me. You should not have put out to sea from Crete to sustain this damage and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>»I urge you to be of good cheer for none of you will lose your life, only the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>»Last night an angel of the God of whom I serve stood beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>»He said, »Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caessar and God has graciously given you the lives of you and all who sail with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>»Be of good cheer. I believe God. It will happen just as he spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>»But we must run aground on some island.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>On the fourteenth night we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria. About midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>They sounded and found twenty fathoms. After a little space they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Fearing they would be cast ashore on rocky ground they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>The sailors were seeking to flee from the ship. They lowered the boat into the sea by pretending they were lowering some anchors from the bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: »Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>At daybreak Paul encouraged all of them to eat some food, saying, »This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue without food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>»I encourage you to take some food for this is for your safety. Not a hair will perish from the head of any of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>After he said this he took some bread, gave thanks to God in the presence of all. He broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they were all cheerful and ate some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>Together there were two hundred and seventy six persons on board.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When daylight came they saw no land. But they thought they saw a bay with a beach. They debated whether to drive the ship upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>They threw the anchors overboard and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>The ship stuck fast on a sandbar and ran aground. The bow struck fast and would not move. Then the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any from swimming away and escaping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>The centurion desired to save Paul so he kept them from doing what they planned. He commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard, and get to the land first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>The rest were to use planks or something from the ship. So they all escaped safe to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we made it to shore safely we learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The natives there were very friendly to us. It started to rain and was cold, so they built a fire and made us all welcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul gathered an armful of sticks and put them on the fire. A snake came out on account of the heat and fastened itself to his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>The natives saw the snake hanging on Pauls hand and said to one another: »This man must be a murderer, but Fate will not let him live, even though he escaped from the sea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But Paul shook the snake off into the fire without being harmed at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>The people were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. They waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him. They changed their minds and said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>A man named Publius, who was the governor of the island, had property around the area. He welcomed us and treated us kindly. We were his guests for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>His father was sick in bed. He suffered from fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, placed his hands on him, and made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After that happened, other sick people on the island went to Paul and were made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They honored us with many gifts. When we were going to set sail, they put whatever we needed on board.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>After three months we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that wintered at the island. The ship had the gods Castor and Pollux carved on its front.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>We stopped at the city of Syracuse and stayed there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>We sailed from Syracuse and arrived at the city of Rhegium. The next day a south wind began to blow, and two days later we arrived at the city of Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>We came across some of the brothers, who kept us with them for seven days; and so we arrived at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>When the brothers had news for us they came out from town as far as Appius Forum Market place on the Appian Road and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us. Paul saw them and praised God. He was encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we arrived at Rome they allowed Paul to have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews. When they assembled, he said to them: »My brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>»They questioned me and were ready to set me free, for they found me not guilty of any crime deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>»When the Jews brought charges against me again I presented my cause to Caesar for I said nothing against my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>The reason I sent for you is to talk with you. I am in these chains because of the hope of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him: »We have not had letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers have come to us to give an account or say any evil about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>»We desire to hear your opinion concerning this sect. We have knowledge that it is attacked in all places.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they set a date with Paul. A large number of them came that day to the place where Paul was staying. From morning till night he explained his message about the Kingdom of God to them. He tried to convince them about Jesus by quoting from the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some of them were convinced by his words, but others did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>So they left, disagreeing among themselves, after Paul had said this one thing: »How well the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>He said, »Go and say to this people, You will listen and listen, but not understand. You will look and look, but not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>»These people have closed their mind and are hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes so that their eyes never see. Their ears never hear. Their minds never understand. They never turn to me for healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>»You need to know that God has sent his salvation to people who are not Jews. They will listen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>After he said this the Jews left arguing among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>Paul rented a place to live for two full years and welcomed everyone who came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>He spread the message about Gods Kingdom and taught boldly about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one stopped him!</verse>
