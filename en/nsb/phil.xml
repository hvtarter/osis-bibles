      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (60-61 C.E.) (Rome)</title>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in union with Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and ministerial servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God for all my memories of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>I always offer prayer filled with joy for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>and for your fellowship in participation of the good news from the first day until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>It is right for me to feel this way on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the good news you are all partakers with me of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>God is my witness, how I long for you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>This way you may approve test the things that are excellent of more value. May you be sincere and without offense blameless to others till the day of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Be filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. (John 15:5) (Galatians 5:22-23)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>I would have you know, brothers that the things that happened to me turned out for the greater progress of the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>My imprisonment in Christ became known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard, and to all brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>Most of the brothers trust in the Lord and boldly speak the word of God without fear because of my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some preach Christ from envy and strife and some from good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The latter ones do it out of love, knowing that I am set appointedplaced here for the defense of the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition without pure motives, thinking to cause me great suffering and distress in my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? That in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed! For that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this will turn out to my redemption through your prayer and the provision of the spirit vital principlesmind of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>I will not be put to shame according to my earnest expectation and hope. With all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in me, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>If I live in the flesh this will bring fruit from my labor. I do not know what to choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>I am hard pressed between the two. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ for it is far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain. Yes, I will remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>Let your rejoicing abound in Christ Jesus through my presence with you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Let your manner of life be worthy of the good news about Christ. Whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your conduct, that you stand fast in one spirit common purposemental dispositionvital principle, with one mind striving together for the faith of the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>Do not be frightened by opponents. This is evidence of destruction for them and salvation for you from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>It has been granted to you in behalf of Christ. Not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>You have the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender affection tender mercy and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>make my joy full by being of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, and of one purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility consider others more important than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Look out for the interest of others and not only for your own personal interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Have this attitude mind-setunderstandingmental state in you that was also in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>He existed in the form shape and nature of God but did not try to be equal with God. He did not even consider it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>He emptied humbled himself by taking the form of a servant. He was made in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>He obtained the appearance as a man, humbled himself, and became obedient even to death, yes, death on the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>For this reason God highly exalted him, and gave to him the name that is above every name, Relative authority given by Jehovah God, the Father to His Son (Philipians 2:11)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>My beloved, you have always obeyed, not just in my presence, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>It is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without complaining grumblingmurmuring and questioning disputing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>That way you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. You are seen as lights in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>Hold fast to the word of life so I may rejoice in the day of Christ. That way I will not have labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>If I am offered for the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>You should also rejoice in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly that I may be encouraged when I know your circumstances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no man likeminded, who will truly care for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>They all seek their own interest and not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know of his proven worth. It was like a son with his father that he served with me to further the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>I hope to send him as soon as I see how it goes with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>I trust in the Lord that I also will come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>I find it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. He is my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>He longed to see you and was worried because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Indeed he was sick and near to death. But God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I have sent him quickly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy. Hold such in honor</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not a bother, but for you it is a safeguard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs impure menfalse teachers! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilation of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>We are those with true circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God. We glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>I might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I have more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>Things that offered gain to me I count a loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>I count all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. I suffered the loss of all things. Yet I count them as refuse garbagedung that I may gain Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>I want to be united with him. I no longer want a righteousness of my own that is gained by obeying the law. The righteousness from God is by faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>I want to know him and the power of his resurrection. I want to know the fellowship of his sufferings and become conformed to his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>I wish to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect. But I press on, that I may obtain that for which Christ Jesus also obtained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I could not yet have obtained it. But one thing I do, I forget the things that are behind, and stretch forward to the things that are ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let those of us who are mature have this attitude. If you have a different attitude God will show you how to think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>However, we should be guided by what we have learned so far.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brothers, be imitators of me. Pay attention to those who live by the example we have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>Many live as enemies of the stake of Christ. I often wept as I told you about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Their end is destruction. Their god is their belly. Their glory is in their shame. They set their mind on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>However, our citizenship is in heaven. We also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Christ will, through his power, bring everything under his authority. He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified glorious body literally and figuratively: body of his glory. He is able to subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my beloved brothers I long to see you. You are my joy and crown. In this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the good news, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness mildnessmoderation be known to all men for the Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things that you have learned, received, heard and saw in me; do these things and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me. You did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>I am not saying this because I am in need; for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be poor. I also know how to live with abundance. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to have abundance and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>You did well that you share with me in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I departed from Macedonia, no other congregation shared their money with me. Only you shared with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>While I was in Thessalonica you provided for my needs twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift but I seek the fruit that adds to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>I have all things, and prosper: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you. It is an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the holy ones greet you, especially they who are of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace Greek: charis: divine influence of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek: pneuma: mental disposition.</verse>
