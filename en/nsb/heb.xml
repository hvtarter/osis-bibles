      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (Rome) (61C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>Long ago on many occasions and in many ways God spoke to our fathers through the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>He has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, through whom he made the ages Greek: aion: ages of time, perpetuity, worlds, generations, human entities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Gods Son is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his being. He sustains all things by his powerful word. After Jesus purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>He has become better than the angels and has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>To which of the angels did God ever say at any time: »You are my son; this day I have begotten you« ? And again: »I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son« ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again: when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says: »Let all the angels of God pay him homage.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Of the angels he says: »He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.« (Psalm 104:4)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But he says to the Son: »God is your throne forever and ever. Your throne, Oh God-like one, is forever.: A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom. (Psalm 45:6, 7)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>»You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands. (Psalm 102:25)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>»They will perish but you remain. They will all grow old like a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>»Just as a coat you fold them up, and they will be changed: but you are the same, and your years will never run out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which of the angels did he say at any time: »Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool« ? (Psalm 110:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for those who will be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Pay close attention to the things heard so we do not drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>If the word spoken through angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward penalty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>How shall we escape, if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first presented by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also testified about it with signs, wonders, and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit given according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>He did not subject the world to come that we speak about to the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But a certain witness has given proof, saying: »What is man, that you are mindful of him? Or what is the son of man that you take care of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>»You made him a little lower than the angels for a little while. Greek: brachus, short time (Psalm 8:4, 5) You crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>»You put all things in subjection under his feet.« You subjected all things to him and left nothing that is not subject to him. Now we do not see yet all things in subjection to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor for suffering death. By the grace of God he tasted death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>It was appropriate that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, should bring many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>Both he who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all from one. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them »brothers«.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>He says: »I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of the congregation I will sing praises to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: »I will put my trust in him.« And again: »Behold, the children that Jehovah has given me.« (Isaiah 8:18)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since the »children« are partakers of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same things, that through death he might destroy him that had the power to cause death, Satan the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>He does not help the angels, but he helps the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>This means that he had to become like his »brothers« in every way, in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice pay atonementto make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>Since he has suffered and was tested in every way; he is able to help those who are being tested.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>He was faithful to Him who appointed him, just as Moses was in His entire house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses. This is because the builder of the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>Every house has a builder. God is the builder of all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Indeed Moses was faithful in His house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>Christ was faithful as a Son over Gods house. We are His house if we hold on to our courage confidence and rejoice speak boldly about our hope until the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>The Holy Spirit says: »Today if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>»do not harden your hearts and be stubborn like those who tested me in the day of temptation in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>»Your forefathers examined inspectedscrutinized me by proving testing me. And they saw my works for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>»I was disgusted angry with this generation, and said: They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>»So I swore in my anger: They will not enter into my rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you develop a wicked heart lacking faith and turning away departing from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>Encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called »Today,« that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become companions partners with Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of our firm trust to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>Scripture says: »Today if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts. Do not be stubborn like those who rebelled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Who were they who heard God and rebelled? All who came out of Egypt with Moses rebelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>With whom was he disgusted for forty years? He was disgusted and angry with those who sinned and died in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>Who did God swear would never enter his rest? He was talking about those who did not obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>We see that they could not enter in on account of a lack of faith unbeliefdisobedience.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>While the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear that one of you might come up short and not enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>Indeed, we have had good news presented to us. They also had it. But the word that was heard did not benefit them because they were not united in faith by what was heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>We who believe enter into the rest. As God said: »I swore in my anger: They shall not enter into my rest.« Yet Gods works were completed from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>Somewhere God said this about the seventh day: »God rested on the seventh day from all his works.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>Again: »They shall not enter into my rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>It remains for some to enter into it. Those who first received the good news did not enter in because they did not obey and lacked faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>He determines a certain day by saying through David: »Today,« after so long a time; just as it was said before, »Today, if you will listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.« (Psalm 95:7)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>If Joshua had given them rest, he God would not have spoken afterwards about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>He who enters into his rest also rests from his own works, just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us do our utmost to enter into that rest. Let no one fall into the same pattern of disobedience by not obeying the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>The Word of God is alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. (Ephesians 6:17) It separates the physical person from the spiritual person, of both joints and marrow. And it can discern judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. (John 12:48)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. All things are uncovered and laid bare before him. We must account to him. (Romans 2:16; Romans 14:12)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>We have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, so let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>We do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our infirmities weaknesses. He was tested in all things like ourselves. Yet he was without sin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us approach the throne of grace loving-kindness with confidence, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>Every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God. He may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He is able to exercise compassion towards the ignorant and those going astray, since he is also subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>That is why he must offer sacrifices, for his own and for the peoples sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>No one takes this honor upon himself. He is called by God, even as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest. It was God who said to him: »You are my Son; I today have become your father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he said in another place:« You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>In the days of his life on earth, when he Christ offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death, and was heard because of his godly reverence. (Galatians 1:1) (Psalm 69:13)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>Being made perfect, he became the source causechannelconduitpathwayfacilitator of eternal salvation to all who obey him. (Psalm 3:8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>He was called by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>We have many things to say about him and it is hard to explain it to you, for you are dull of hearing slow to learn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>At this time you should be teachers. But you need someone to teach you again from the beginning the elementary truths from the Word of God. You need milk, not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>Everyone who drinks milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food belongs to mature people. It belongs to those who by reason of use have their senses trained to know the difference between good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore leaving the elementary truths of the doctrine of Christ let us move on to maturity. Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>We should not repeat the basic teachings about baptisms, and of the laying on of hands setting apart for holy tasks, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>We will do this if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>Those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>if they shall fall away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. This is because they personally impale the Son of God again, and expose him to public shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>The earth that drinks in the rain that comes upon it, and brings forth vegetation for those by whom it was cultivated, receives blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>That which bears thorns and briars is rejected, and is near to being cursed. It ends up being burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>Even though we speak this way, beloved, we are convinced that you will have better things, things that belong to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unrighteous unjust to forget your work and the love you showed for his name. You ministered to the holy ones and continue to minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>We desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope down to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>We desire that you are not lazy, but follow those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>When God made a promise to Abraham, he could swear by no one greater then himself, so he swore by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>He said: »I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>After waiting patiently, Abraham received the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>Men swear by someone greater then themselves: and an oath for confirmation to them puts an end to the problem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>When God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he confirmed it with an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>God did this to offer encouragement so we may rely on the hope offered to us. We have taken refuge in that hope and it is impossible for God to lie. These two things can never be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of life. It is a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>That is where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything to him. He was first of all, by translation of his name, »King of Righteousness,« and then he was also ruler of Salem, which means, »King of Peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>He was without father or mother or genealogy, and neither had beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he continues as a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>See how great he was! Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>The descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the Law to take tithes from the people. This is from their brothers, for these are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But this man does not have their genealogy. He received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>It is beyond dispute that the superior blesses the inferior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>In this instance mortal men receive tithes, in the other by the one of whom it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>One might even say that Levi, the priest who takes the tenth from the people, gave his tenth through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>He was still in the loins of his ancestor not yet born when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood, for under it the people received the Law, what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, instead of one named after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>The priesthood was changed, and therefore it is necessary to also change the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>The one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>It is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>This is clear if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>He would become such, not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is announced: »You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>The former commandment was set aside because it was weak and useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>The Law could not make anything perfect. A better hope has been provided through which we can draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>It was not without an oath. Others were made priest without any oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>He became a priest with an oath when God said to him: »Jehovah has sworn and he will feel no regret, you are a priest forever.« (Psalm 110:4)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>Jesus became the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>There have been many priests. This is because they have been prevented from continuing by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>He continues forever and therefore has his priesthood without change.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>He is able to save completely those who approach God through him, because he is always alive to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>Such a high priest as this was suitable for us. He is holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and higher than the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>He does not have a day-by-day need as the high priests do, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then for those of the people. He sacrificed for sin once for all when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>The Law appoints men as high priests who have weakness. But the oath that came after the Law appointed the Son who is perfect forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Here is a summary of the things we are discussing: We have this kind of high priest. He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>He is a minister of the Holy Place and of the true Tabernacle, built by Jehovah and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. It is necessary to have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. It is the same as it was with Moses. When he was about to build the sacred tent, God told him: »Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry. The covenant that he arranged between God and his people is a better one, because it is based on promises of better things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>God finds fault with his people and said to them: »The time is coming, says Jehovah, when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. (Jeremiah 31:31)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>The first covenant had ordinances for divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>A tabernacle was set up. The first room was called »the Holy Place.« It contained the lamp stand and table and the consecrated bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>Beyond the second curtain was a room called »the Most Holy Place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>It had a golden incense burner. The Ark of the Covenant was completely covered with gold. It contained the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>The cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat were above the Ark. Now is not the time to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>When these things are prepared, the priests enter the outer room often to carry on their services.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>Only the high priest enters the inner room. Once a year he entered with blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit revealed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the tent was still in use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>This is a symbol that points to the present time. It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshipers heart perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>since they have to do only with food, drink, and various purification ceremonies. These are all outward rules, which apply only until the time comes to change them for something better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here. He also went into a much better tent that is not made by humans and does not belong to this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>He went once and forever into the Most Holy Place having eternal salvation. It is not with the blood of goats and young bulls, but with his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>The blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes from the burning of a young cow, sprinkled on the unclean made them outwardly clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>The blood of Christ did even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself without blemish to God and cleansed your conscience from dead works. Now we can serve worship the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant. A death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant. Those called may receive the promise of everlasting inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>A will is used for a person who is dead. It becomes effective only when the person dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>A will is in force after a person dies. Otherwise it is not in effect at all while the one who provided it lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>The first covenant was dedicated with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>He said: »This is the blood of the covenant that God has presented to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>He sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Almost all things are by the Law purified with blood. There is no forgiveness unless blood is poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these. But the heavenly things should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>Christ has not entered into the Holy Place made with human hands. This is a copy of the true one. He has entered into heaven to appear before the presence of God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Neither should he offer himself as the high priest enters into the Holy Place every year with blood of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>Otherwise he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. He has presented himself once at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>It is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. He will appear the second time without sin to those who look to him for their salvation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>The Law is a shadow of the good things to come. It is not the actual things. The continual yearly sacrifices can never make those who worship perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>If it could, it would cease to be offered. Once the worshipers were cleansed they would have no awareness of sin anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>These sacrifices are an annual reminder of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>When Christ came into the world he said: »Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but you have prepared a body for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>»You have no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>»Then I said: I have come in the scroll of the book. It is written about me, to do your will, O God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Then he said: »You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin;« which are offered by the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>He also said: »I come to do your will, O God.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>We are sanctified by his »will« through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>Every priest stands daily, serving and offering time after time the same sacrifices. Yet they can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>waiting until his enemies are placed as a stool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>With one offering he has perfected those who are sanctified forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>The Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after that he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>»This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says Jehovah; I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them. (Jeremiah 31:33)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>»I will not remember their sins and unrighteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Where there is forgiveness for these, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way, which he consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>He that despised Moses Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>What about those who despise the Son of God? Those who treat as a cheap thing the blood of Gods covenant that purified them from sin? Those who insult the Spirit of grace? Think how much worse the punishment they deserve will be!</verse>
