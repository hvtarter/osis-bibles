      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <title>(Writer: James, overseer in the Jerusalem congregation, AND BROTHER of the Lord) (62 C.E.) (Jerusalem)</title>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>This letter is from James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to the twelve tribes that are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>Count it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>Know that the testing of your faith produces patience endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be mature, complete, and lacking in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God. He gives to all generously and without reproach and it will be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>However he must ask in faith, not doubting: for he who doubts is like a surging wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>Do not let that man think that he will receive anything from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A double-minded man is unstable inconsistent in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Let the brother of humble circumstances glory in his high position exaltation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>But the rich must be glad when God humbles them. This is because they will wither like wildflowers and pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>The sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. The flower falls off and its beauty perishes. So also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>The man who endures under trial is blessed. For when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no man say when he is tempted: "God tempts me." God cannot be tempted with evil, and he tempts enticesteststrys no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>Each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his evil desire lust. He is enticed allured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then evil desires, when conceived, give birth to sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights truth and spiritual purity, with whom there is no variation. He does not change like shifting shadows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Using his own will, he gave us birth through the word of truth. This way we would be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>You know this, my beloved brothers. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>The anger of man does not promote the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore get rid of all filthiness and wickedness. Receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, who deceive themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>He sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continues, being not a hearer who forgets but a doer who works, this man will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any man thinks he is religious, while he does not control his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is vain worthlessuseless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for the fatherless persons and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brothers, keep the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. Do not favor one person over the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>A man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes comes into your synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>You pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes, and say: "Sit here in a good place." Then you say to the poor man: "Stand there," or "Sit under my footstool."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Do not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my dearly beloved brothers! Did God choose poor people in the world to be rich in faith and to receive the kingdom he promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>You have dishonored the poor man. Do the rich oppress you, and personally drag you into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>When you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But when you show partiality you commit sin. The law then convicts you as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>Whoever obeys the whole law and yet stumbles in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he who said: "Do not commit adultery," also said: "Do not murder" Greek: phoneuo: kill, slay, murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>You should speak and act as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment is without mercy to him who shows no mercy. And mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith but he does not have works? Can that faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is without clothes and in lack of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you says to them: "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you do not give them food and clothing, what good is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Even so, faith without works is dead. It is alone and by itself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>A man will say: "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that there is one God. You do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>Are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless barrenlifeless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You see that faith acted with his works, and works made faith perfect complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>The scripture was fulfilled which says: "Abraham believed Jehovah and it was reckoned imputedconsideredcredited to him for righteousness." He was called »Jehovahs friend" (Genesis 15:6) ( Isaiah 41:8).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see that a man is justified declared and pronounced righteous by works, and not by faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>Rahab the harlot was justified by her works. When she received the messengers she sent them out another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>Just as the body without the spirit is dead; even so faith without works is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Many of you should not be teachers, my brothers. You know that we will receive a heavier stricter judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>We all stumble in many things. If any do not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to restrain control the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>We put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us. We guide their whole bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Look at ships. They are large and are driven by rough winds. Yet a very small rudder can control them, wherever the captain wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>The tongue also is a little member. It boasts great things. Consider how great a forest fire a small fire kindles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>The tongue is like fire, the place of iniquity among our members. It defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of our life. It is set ablaze like the ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>Every kind of beast and bird, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil. It is full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>We bless Jehovah, the Father, with it. (Psalm 34:1) Then we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth! My brothers, these things should not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither can salt water yield sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are from meekness because of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>If you have bitter jealousy envy and greedy ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where jealousy and selfishness are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, without discord partiality, without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>What causes wars and fighting among you? Is the cause of fighting your sensual lusts for pleasure that battle within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You lust, and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain! You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly with bad motives that you may spend it on your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity hatredhostility toward God? Whoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or do you think the scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the attitude of the heart mental disposition that he induced to live in us cause us to envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he gives more grace. The scripture said, "God resists the proud, but gives grace loving-kindness to the humble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Be subject to God! Resist Satan the Devil and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded uncertaindoubterskeptic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves in the presence of God, and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Brothers, do not speak against each other. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>Only one is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you that you judge your neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, you that say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and make profit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>You do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor puff of air that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>You should say, "If God wills, we should both live, and do this or that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>You glory in your conceit. Such glory is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>He that knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and your silver are rusted. Their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up your treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which are held back by you, cry out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You lived in luxury on the earth, and take your pleasure; you nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned, and you have killed the righteous one. He does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and late rains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You also be patient. Make your hearts firm, for the coming of the Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Do not complain utter a deep sigh against one another, that you not be judged. Behold, the judge is standing at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Brothers, accept the example of suffering and patience by the prophets who spoke in the name of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>As you know, those who have endured are called blessed. You have heard of the patience perseveranceendurance of Job, and have seen the outcome Jehovah provided, how he was very tender with his affection and mercy. (Psalm 103:8)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>Above all things, my brothers do not swear by heaven, or by earth, or by any other oath. Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No. That way you will not fall under judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any among you sick? Let him call the elders of the congregation. Let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>The prayer of faith will save the sick person. God will raise him up; and if he committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man helps much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of like passions with us. He prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>He prayed again; and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and one brings him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>let him know, that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a person from death, and cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
