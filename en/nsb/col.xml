        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>This is because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. You heard about this hope from the word of truth, the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>It came to you even as it did. Everywhere in the entire world it bears fruit and it increases in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace loving-kindness of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>You learned about Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>God will strengthen you with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and longsuffering with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>Give thanks to the Father, who made us partakers of the inheritance of the holy ones in the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>He rescued us from the power of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love the Son he dearly loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>We have in him our redemption and the forgiveness of our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image likenessrepresentation of the invisible God. He is the firstborn Greek: prototokos: childbirth, offspring of all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>All things in the heavens and upon the earth where created through him. The things visible and invisible were created through him. Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>He is before all things, and through him all things originate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>He is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning commencement, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence first place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>Provided that you continue in the faith, grounded on the foundation and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news you heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven. For this I,Paul, was made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake. I do my share in behalf of his body, the congregation, to provide what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>God gave me this stewardship to perform for your good. He has made me a servant of the congregation. It is for the task of fully proclaiming the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>It is the secret he hid through all past ages from all human beings but has now revealed to his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>It was Gods will to make known his secret to the people of the nations, this rich and glorious secret that he has for people. The secret is that Christ is in union with you, which means that you will share in his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>We preach Christ to everyone. With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one to God as a mature individual in union with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>I work hard to get this done. I use the mighty strength Christ supplies. It is at work in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>Let me tell you how hard I worked for you, for the people in Laodicea, and for all others who do not personally know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>I do this that they may be filled with courage and be united knit together in love. I have the full assurance that only true understanding brings. In this way they will accurately know Gods secret, which is Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>In him is concealed all the hidden treasures of Gods wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>I tell you this: Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments, no matter how good they seem to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>Even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit mental disposition. I am glad when I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>You have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord. Now walk live in union with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>Keep your roots deep in him! Build your lives on him. Become stronger in your faith, as you were taught, and be filled with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>See to it that no one enslaves you by means of philosophy and worthless deceit of human wisdom according to tradition of men. It is according to the elementary principles of the world, and not from Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>The fullness of divine nature lives in Christs bodily form. Greek: theotes: essence and nature of GodOnly the Son of God could have divine attributes, the inherited qualities from the Father</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>You are made full completeperfectmature in him. He is the head over all government and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>You have been buried with him in baptism. You were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>He blotted out the bond written in ordinances. It was against us and was contrary to us. He has taken it out of the way. He nailed it to the stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>He disarmed the rulers and authorities! He made a public display of them triumphing over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no man judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>They are a shadow of the things to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no man rob you of your prize by a self-abasement and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things that he has seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>»Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>These are the precepts and doctrines of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>These have, indeed, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body. But these are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If you have been raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Think about the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>You once walked in these when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>Now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, seeing that you got rid of the old self with its evil practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>You put on the new self that is being renewed to a true knowledge full discernment according to the image of the one who created him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>There is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all and in all.</verse>
