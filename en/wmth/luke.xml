  <div osisID='Luke' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative of the facts which are received with full assurance among us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and were devoted to the service of the divine Message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation of the facts from their commencement, to write for you, most noble Theophilus, a connected account,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you may fully know the truth of the things which you have been taught by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the time of Herod, the king of Judaea, a priest of the name of Zechariah, belonging to the class of Abijah. He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren; and both of them were far advanced in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed course of his class,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>it fell to his lot –according to the custom of the priesthood– to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying, at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>and Zechariah on seeing him was agitated and terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard: and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice over his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children, and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright, to make a people perfectly ready for the lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>»By what proof,« asked Zechariah, »shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>»I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God,« answered the angel, »and I have been sent to talk with you and tell you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words–words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary; but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself secluded five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>»Thus has the Lord dealt with me,« she said, »now that He has graciously taken away my reproach among men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, »Joy be to you, favoured one! the Lord is with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>She was greatly agitated at his words, and wondered what such a greeting meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>But the angel said, »Do not be frightened, Mary, for you have found favour with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are to call His name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.' And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages, and of His Kingdom there will be no end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>»How can this be,« Mary replied, »seeing that I have no husband?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for this reason your holy offspring will be called `the Son of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And see, your relative Elizabeth–she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For no promise from God will be impossible of fulfilment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>»I am the Lord's maidservant,« Mary replied; »may it be with me in accordance with your words!« And then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Not long after this, Mary rose up and went in haste into the hill country to a town in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt within her. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and uttered a loud cry of joy. »Blest among women are you,« she said, »and the offspring of your body is blest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within me leapt for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who has believed, for the word spoken to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said: »My soul extols the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit triumphs in God my Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position; For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Because the mighty One has done great things for me –Holy is His name!–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those who fear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has manifested His supreme strength. He has scattered those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men of low estate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich He has sent empty-handed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>His servant Israel He has helped, Remembering His compassion–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers–For Abraham and his posterity for ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord had had great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>His mother, however, said, »No, he is to be called John.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>»There is not one of your family,« they said, »who has that name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began to speak and bless God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And all who lived round about them were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all these things were spread abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All who heard the story treasured it in their memories. »What then will this child be?« they said. For the lord's hand was indeed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke in a rapture of praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>»Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,« he said, »Because He has not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of David His servant–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As He has spoken from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And so render worship to Him free from fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In piety and uprightness before Him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give to His People a knowledge of salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which the daybreak from on high will come to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>Dawning on those who now dwell in the darkness and shadow of death–To direct our feet into the path of peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and became strong in character, and lived in the Desert till the time came for him to appear publicly to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole Empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>It was the first registration made during the governorship of Quirinius in Syria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>and all went to be registered–every one to the town to which he belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judaea, to David's town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>But while they were there, her full time came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country, keeping watch over their sheep by night in the open fields,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>But the angel said to them, »Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy–joy for all the People.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For a Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>»Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among men who please Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw the child, they told what had been said to them about Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>as it is written in the Law of the Lord: »Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they were in deadly peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, »a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>»Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace, in fulfilment of Thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>A light to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of Thy people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And while the child's father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, »This child is appointed for the falling and the uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings in many hearts may be revealed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>There was also Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>and then being a widow of eighty-four years. She was never absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night, with fasting and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the deliverance of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day's journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>On the third day they found Him in the Temple sitting among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them questions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence and at the answers He gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, »My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>»Why is it that you have been searching for me?« He replied; »did you not know that it is my duty to be engaged upon my Father's business?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>But they did not understand the significance of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these incidents in her memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.53'>And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Judaea, Herod Tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip Tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>during the High-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, a message from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the Desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>John went into all the district about the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of the penitent for the forgiveness of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, »The voice of one crying aloud! `In the Desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill levelled down, the crooked places shall be turned into straight roads, and the rugged ways into smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and then shall all mankind see God's salvation.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Accordingly John used to say to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, `O vipers' brood, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Live lives which shall prove your change of heart; and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree which fails to yield good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>The crowds repeatedly asked him, »What then are we to do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>»Let the man who has two coats,« he answered, »give one to the man who has none; and let the man who has food share it with others.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>There came also a party of tax-gatherers to be baptized, and they asked him, »Rabbi, what are we to do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>»Do not exact more than the legal amount,« he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>The soldiers also once and again inquired of him, »And we, what are we to do?« His answer was, »Neither intimidate any one nor lay false charges; and be content with your pay.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And while the people were in suspense and all were debating in their minds whether John might possibly be the Anointed One,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>he answered the question by saying to them all, »As for me, I am baptizing you with water, but One mightier than I is coming, whose very sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten: He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>With many exhortations besides these he declared the Good News to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds that he had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw John into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove, upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, »Thou art My Son, dearly loved: in Thee is My delight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.23'>And He –Jesus– when He began His ministry, was about thirty years old. He was the son (it was supposed) of Joseph, son of Heli,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.4'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led about by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>tempted all the while by the Devil. During those days He ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>Then the Devil said to Him, »If you are God's Son, tell this stone to become bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>»It is written,« replied Jesus, »`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see at a glance all the kingdoms of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the Devil said to Him, »To you will I give all this authority and this splendour; for it has been handed over to me, and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>Jesus answered him, »It is written, `To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, »If you are God's Son, throw yourself down from here; for it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>`He will give orders to His angels concerning thee, to guard thee safely;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>and `On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>The reply of Jesus was, »It is said, `Thou shalt not put the Lord they God to the proof.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>So the Devil, having fully tried every kind of temptation on Him, left Him for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee; and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning praise from all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up; and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And there was handed to Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and, opening the book, He found the place where it was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>»The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind: to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant, and sat down–to speak. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>Then He proceeded to say to them, »To-day is this Scripture fulfilled in your hearing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And they all spoke well of Him, wondering at the sweet words of kindness which fell from His lips, while they asked one another, »Is not this Joseph's son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>»Doubtless,« said He, »you will quote to me the proverb, `Physician, cure yourself: all that we hear that you have done at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>»I tell you in solemn truth,« He added, »that no Prophet is welcomed among his own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel in the time of Elijah, when there was no rain for three years and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent: he was only sent to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian was.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words, were filled with fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, to throw Him down the cliff;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He spoke with the language of authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>But in the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. In a loud voice he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>»Ha! Jesus the Nazarene, what have you to do with us? I know who you are–God's Holy One!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked the demon. »Silence!« He exclaimed; »come out of him.« Upon this, the demon hurled the man into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing him any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another, »What sort of language is this? For with authority and real power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the talk about Him spread into every part of the neighbouring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from an acute attack of fever; and they consulted Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>Then standing over her He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she at once rose and waited on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one, and cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, »You are the Son of God.« But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him, and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured to detain Him that He might not leave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But He said to them, »I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose I was sent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>And for some time He preached in the synagogues in Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him to push out a little from land. Then He sat down and taught the crowd of people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, »Push out into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>»Rabbi,« replied Peter, »all night long we have worked hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let down the nets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their nets began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats so that they almost sank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and exclaimed, »Master, leave my boat, for I am a sinful man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>(For he was astonished and terrified –he and all his companions– at the haul of fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.) But Jesus replied to Simon, »Fear not: from this time you shall be a catcher of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns, there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, »Sir, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, »I am willing; be cleansed!« And instantly the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>He ordered him to tell no one. »But go,« He said, »show yourself to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification which Moses appointed, as evidence for them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But all the more the report about Him spread abroad, and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for Him to cure people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed, and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling –bed and all– into the midst, in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>He saw their faith and said to him, »Friend, your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, »Who is this, uttering blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions by asking in turn, »What is this that you are debating in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier? –to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins« –Turning to the paralytic He said, »I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress on which he had been lying, and went away to his home, giving glory to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Amazement seized them all. »Glory to God!« was the abiding feeling. Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, »We have seen strange things to-day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>He rose, left everything, and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers and others at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate with His disciples and ask, »Why are you eating and drinking with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>But Jesus replied to them, »It is not men in good health who require a physician, but the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Again they said to Him, »John's disciples fast often and pray, as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>»Can you compel the bridal party to fast,« replied Jesus, »so long as they have the bridegroom among them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been taken away from them: then, at that time, they will fast.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He also spoke in figurative language to them. »No one,« He said, »tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one. Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch from the new would not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new; for he says, `The old is better.'«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now on the second-first Sabbath while He was passing through the wheatfields, His disciples were plucking the ears and rubbing them with their hands to eat the grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>And some of the Pharisees asked, »Why are you doing what the Law forbids on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>»Have you never read so much as this,« answered Jesus– »what David did when he and his followers were hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered the house of God and took and ate the Presented Loaves and gave some to his followers–loaves which none but the Priests are allowed to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>»The Son of Man,« He added, »is Lord of the Sabbath also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another Sabbath He had gone to the synagogue and was teaching there; and in the congregation was a man whose right arm was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The Scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath that they might be able to bring an accusation against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>He knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the withered arm, »Rise, and stand there in the middle.« And he rose and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, »I put it to you all whether we are allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil; to save a life, or to destroy it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And looking round upon them all He said to the man, »Stretch out your arm.« He did so, and the arm was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with madness, and began to discuss with one another what they should do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>About that time He went out on one occasion into the hill country to pray; and He remained all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>When it was day, He called His disciples; and He selected from among them twelve, whom He also named Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.14'>These were Simon, to whom also He had given the name of Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.15'>Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>James's relative Judas, and Judas Iscariot who proved to be a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>With these He came down till He reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a multitude of people from every part of Judaea, from Jerusalem, and from the sea-side district of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>and those who were tormented by foul spirits were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>The whole crowd were eager to touch Him, because power went forth from him and cured every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Then fixing His eyes upon His disciples, Jesus said to them, »Blessed are you poor, because the Kingdom of God is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.21'>»Blessed are you who hunger now, because your hunger shall be satisfied.« Blessed are you who now weep aloud, because you shall laugh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.22'>»Blessed are you when men shall hate you and exclude you from their society and insult you, and spurn your very names as evil things, for the Son of Man's sake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.23'>»Be glad at such a time, and dance for joy; for your reward is great in Heaven; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the Prophets!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.24'>»But alas for you rich men, because you already have your consolation!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.25'>»Alas for you who now have plenty to eat, because you will be hungry!« Alas for you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep aloud!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.26'>»Alas for you when men shall all have spoken well of you; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the false Prophets!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.27'>»But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies; seek the welfare of those who hate you;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.28'>bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.29'>To him who gives you a blow on one side of the face offer the other side also; and to him who is robbing you of your outer garment refuse not the under one also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.30'>To every one who asks, give; and from him who takes away your property, do not demand it back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.31'>And behave to your fellow men just as you would have them behave to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.32'>»If you love those who love you, what credit is it to you? Why, even bad men love those who love them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.33'>And if you are kind to those who are kind to you, what credit is it to you? Even bad men act thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.34'>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is it to you? Even bad men lend to their fellows so as to receive back an equal amount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.35'>Nevertheless love your enemies, be beneficent; and lend without hoping for any repayment. Then your recompense shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.39'>He also spoke to them in figurative language. »Can a blind man lead a blind man?« He asked; »would not both fall into the ditch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.40'>There is no disciple who is superior to his teacher; but every one whose instruction is complete will be like his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.41'>»And why look at the splinter in your brother's eye instead of giving careful attention to the beam in your own?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take that splinter out of your eye,' when all the while you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? Vain pretender! take the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>A good man from the good stored up in his heart brings out what is good; and an evil man from the evil stored up brings out what is evil; for from the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>Every one who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them in practice, I will show you whom he is like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>He is like a man building a house, who digs and goes deep, and lays the foundation on the rock; and when a flood comes, the torrent bursts upon that house, but is unable to shake it, because it is securely built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who has heard and not practised is like a man who has built a house upon the soft soil without a foundation, against which the torrent bursts, and immediately it collapses, and terrible is the wreck and ruin of that house.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>After He had finished teaching all these things in the hearing of the people, He went into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>Here the servant of a certain Captain, a man dear to his master, was ill and at the point of death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>and the Captain, hearing about Jesus, sent to Him some of the Jewish Elders, begging Him to come and restore his servant to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And they, when they came to Jesus, earnestly entreated Him, pleading, »He deserves to have this favour granted him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and at his own expense he built our synagogue for us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the Captain sent friends to Him with the message: »Sir, do not trouble to come. I am not worthy of having you come under my roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>and therefore I did not deem myself worthy to come to you. Only speak the word, and let my young man be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I too am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; to another, `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this or that,' and he does it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Jesus listened to the Captain's message and was astonished at him, and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, »I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And the friends who had been sent, on returning to the house, found the servant in perfect health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Shortly afterwards He went to a town called Nain, attended by His disciples and a great crowd of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And just as He reached the gate of the town, they happened to be bringing out for burial a dead man who was his mother's only son; and she was a widow; and a great number of the townspeople were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>The Lord saw her, was moved with pity for her, and said to her, »Do not weep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Then He went close and touched the bier, and the bearers halted. »Young man,« He said, »I command you, wake!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>The dead man sat up and began to speak; and He restored him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>All were awe-struck, and they gave glory to God–some saying, »A Prophet, a great Prophet, has risen up among us.« Others said, »God has not forgotten His People.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And the report of what Jesus had done spread through the whole of Judaea and in all the surrounding districts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>John's disciples brought him an account of all these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>so John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord. »Are you the Coming One?« he asked, »or is there another that we are to expect?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>The men came to Jesus and said, »John the Baptist has sent us to you with this question: `Are you the Coming One, or is there another that we are to expect?'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>He immediately cured many of diseases, severe pain, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He gave the gift of sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Then He answered the messengers, »Go and report to John what you have seen and heard. Blind men receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are purified, deaf persons hear, the dead are raised to life, the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because of my claims.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When John's messengers were gone, He proceeded to say to the multitude concerning John, »What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at? A reed waving in the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man wearing luxurious clothes? People who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are found in palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A Prophet? Aye, I tell you, and far more than a Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>John is the man about whom it is written, `See, I am sending My messenger before thy face, and he shall make ready thy way before thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>»I tell you that among all of women born there is not one greater than John. Yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being baptized with John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated God's purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>»To what then shall I compare the men of the present generation, and what do they resemble?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the public square and calling out to one another, `We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not shown sorrow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, `He has a demon!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Look, there is a man who is overfond of eating and drinking–he is a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified by all who are truly wise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees repeatedly invited Him to a meal at his house; so He entered the house and reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner. Having learnt that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house she brought a flask of perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and, standing behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured the perfume over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself, »This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching him–and would know that she is an immoral woman.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>In answer to his thoughts Jesus said to him, »Simon, I have a word to say to you.« »Rabbi, say on,« he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>»There were once two men in debt to one money-lender,« said Jesus; »one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>But neither of them could pay anything; so he freely forgave them both. Tell me, then, which of them will love him most?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>»I suppose,« replied Simon, »the one to whom he forgave most.«»You have judged rightly,« Jesus rejoined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, »Do you see this woman? I came into your house: you gave me no water for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears, and then wiped the tears away with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has not left off tenderly kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>No oil did you pour even on my head; but she has poured perfume upon my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins, are forgiven–because she has loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And He said to her, »Your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Then the other guests began to say to themselves, »Who can this man be who even forgives sins?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But He said to the woman, »Your faith has cured you: go, and be at peace.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village after village, proclaiming His Message and telling the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women whom He had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases–Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women, all of whom contributed to the support of Jesus and His Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>»The sower,« He said, »goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon, or the birds of the air come and peck it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it withers away for want of moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Another part falls among the thorns, and the thorns grow up with it and stifle it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and yields a return of a hundred for one.« While thus speaking, He cried aloud and said, »Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>The disciples proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>»To you,« He replied, »it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables, in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear and yet not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>The meaning of the parable is as follows. The seed is God's Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive it joyfully; but they have no root: for a time they believe, but when trial comes they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard, but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield nothing in perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But as for that in the good ground, it means those who, having listened to the Message with open minds and in a right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>»When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a vessel or hide it under a couch; he puts it on a lampstand, that people who enter the room may see the light.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen; nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into the light of day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything, to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing, even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get near Him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>But He was told, »Your mother and brothers are standing on the edge of the crowd, and want to see you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>»My mother and my brothers,« He replied, »are these who hear God's Message and obey it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day He went on board a boat–both He and his disciples; and He said to them, »Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake.« So they set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>dummy verses inserted by amos</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>So they came and woke Him, crying, »Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning.« Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>»Where is your faith?« He asked them. But they were filled with terror and amazement, and said to one another, »Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves, and they obey Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>Then they put in to shore in the country of the Gerasenes, which lies opposite to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was possessed by demons–for a long time he had not put on any garment, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Do not torture me, I beseech you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For already He had been commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. For many a time it had seized and held him, and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces, and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>»What is your name?« Jesus asked him. »Legion,« he replied–because a great number of demons had entered into him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into the Bottomless Pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them, and He gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The demons came out of the man and left him, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff into the Lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported it both in town and country;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>whereupon the people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent districts begged Him to depart from them; for their terror was great. So He went on board and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>»Return home,« He said, »and tell there all that God has done for you.« So he went and published through the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Now when Jesus was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome; for they had all been looking out for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue, who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him to come to his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage –and had spent on doctors all she had, but none of them had been able to cure her–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe; and instantly her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>»Who is it touched me?« Jesus asked. And when all denied having done so, Peter and the rest said, »Rabbi, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>»Some one has touched me,« Jesus replied, »for I feel that power has gone out from me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she stated before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>»Daughter,« said He, »your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of the Synagogue from his house and said, »Your daughter is dead; trouble the Rabbi no further.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus heard the words and said to him, »Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her; but He said, »Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, »Child, awake!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up; and He directed them to give her some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were astounded; but He forbad them to mention the matter to any one.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Then calling the Twelve together He conferred on them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to cure the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And He commanded them, »Take nothing for your journey; neither stick nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have an extra under garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you enter, make that your home, and from it start afresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>Wherever they refuse to receive you, as you leave that town shake off the very dust from your feet as a protest against them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they departed and visited village after village, spreading the Good News and performing cures everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was going on; and he was bewildered because of its being said by some that John had come back to life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some one of the ancient Prophets had come back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, »John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such reports?« And he sought for an opportunity of seeing Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>The Apostles, on their return, related to Jesus all they had done. Then He took them and withdrew to a quiet retreat, to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the immense crowd, aware of this, followed Him; and receiving them kindly He proceeded to speak to them of the Kingdom of God, and those who needed to be restored to health, He cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now when the day began to decline, the Twelve came to Him and said, »Send the people away, that they may go to the villages and farms round about and find lodging and a supply of food; because here we are in an uninhabited district.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>»You yourselves,« He said, »must give them food.«»We have nothing,« they replied, »but five loaves and a couple of fish, unless indeed we were to go and buy provisions for all this host of people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>(For there were about 5,000 adult men.) But He said to His disciples, »Make them sit down in parties of about fifty each.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did so, making them all, without exception, sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed them and broke them into portions which He gave to the disciples to distribute to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>So they ate and were fully satisfied, all of them; and what they had remaining over was gathered up, twelve baskets of fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>One day when He was praying by Himself the disciples were present; and He asked them, »Who do the people say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>»John the Baptist,« they replied; »but others say Elijah; and others that some one of the ancient Prophets has come back to life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>»But you,« He asked, »who do you say that I am?«»God's Anointed One,« replied Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And Jesus strictly forbad them to tell this to any one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>and He said, »The Son of Man must suffer much cruelty, be rejected by the Elders and High Priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day be raised to life again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And He said to all, »If any one is desirous of following me, let him ignore self and take up his cross day by day, and so be my follower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>Why, what benefit is it to a man to have gained the whole world, but to have lost or forfeited his own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever shall have been ashamed of me and my teachings, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own and the Father's glory and in that of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I tell you truly that there are some of those who stand here who will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>It was about eight days after this that Jesus, taking with Him Peter, John, and James, went up the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And while He was praying the appearance of His face underwent a change, and His clothing became white and radiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And suddenly there were two men conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>They came in glory, and kept speaking about His death, which He was so soon to undergo in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and the others were weighed down with sleep; but, keeping themselves awake all through, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And when they were preparing to depart from Him, Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three tents–one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.« He did not know what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>But while he was thus speaking, there came a cloud which spread over them; and they were awe-struck when they had entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>Then there came a voice from within the cloud:»This is My Son, My Chosen One: listen to Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>After this voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept it to themselves, and said not a word to any one at that time about what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>On the following day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great crowd came to meet Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>and a man from the crowd called out, »Rabbi, I beg you to pity my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>At times a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him, and makes him foam at the mouth, and does not leave him till it has well-nigh covered him with bruises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I entreated your disciples to expel the spirit, but they could not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>»O unbelieving and perverse generation!« replied Jesus; »how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>Now while the youth was coming, the spirit dashed him to the ground and cruelly convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the youth and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And all were awe-struck at the mighty power of God. And while every one was expressing wonder at all that He was doing, He said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>»As for you, store these my sayings in your memory; for, before long, the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand His meaning: it was veiled from them that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Now there arose a dispute among them, which of them was to be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>And Jesus, knowing the reasoning that was in their hearts, took a young child and made him stand by His side</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, »Whoever for my sake receives this little child, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives Him who sent me. For the lowliest among you all–he is the greatest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>»Rabbi,« replied John, »we have seen a man making use of your name to expel demons; and we forbad him, because he does not come with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>»Do not forbid him,« said Jesus, »for he who is not against you is on your side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now when the time drew near for Him to be received up again into Heaven, He proceeded with fixed purpose towards Jerusalem, and sent messengers before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>They went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But the people there would not receive Him, because He was evidently going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Master, do you wish us to order fire to come down from Heaven and consume them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But He turned and rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And, as they proceeded on their way, a man came to Him and said, »I will follow you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>»The foxes have holes,« said Jesus, »and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>»Follow me,« He said to another. »Master,« the man replied, »allow me first to go and bury my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>»Leave the dead,« Jesus rejoined, »to bury their own dead; but you must go and announce far and wide the coming of the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>»Master,« said yet another, »I will follow you; but allow me first to go and say good-bye to my friends at home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus answered him, »No one who has put his hand to the plough, and then looks behind him, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them before Him, by twos, to go to every town or place which He Himself intended to visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>And He addressed them thus: »The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few: therefore entreat the Owner of the harvest to send out more reapers into His fields. And now go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Remember that I am sending you out as lambs into the midst of wolves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>When the Seventy returned, they exclaimed joyfully, »Master, even the demons submit to us when we utter your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>»I saw Satan fall like a lightning-flash out of Heaven,« He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>»I have given you power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot, and to trample on all the power of the Enemy; and in no case shall anything do you harm.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>On that same occasion Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit with rapturous joy. »I give Thee fervent thanks,« He exclaimed, »O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of understanding, and hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>And He turned towards His disciples and said to them apart, »Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>Then an expounder of the Law stood up to test Him with a question. »Rabbi,« he asked, »what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>»Go to the Law,« said Jesus; »what is written there? how does it read?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>»`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'« he replied, »`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole strength, and thy whole mind; and thy fellow man as much as thyself.'«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But he, desiring to justify himself, said, »But what is meant by my `fellow man'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus replied, »A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell among robbers, who after both stripping and beating him went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now a priest happened to be going down that way, and on seeing him passed by on the other side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan, being on a journey, came where he lay, and seeing him was moved with pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>He went to him, and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and bound them up. Then placing him on his own mule he brought him to an inn, where he bestowed every care on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>The next day he took out two shillings and gave them to the innkeeper. »`Take care of him,' he said, `and whatever further expense you are put to, I will repay it you at my next visit.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>»The one who showed him pity,« he replied. »Go,« said Jesus, »and act in the same way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>As they pursued their journey He came to a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed Him to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's feet and listened to His teaching.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>At one place where He was praying, when He rose from His knees one of His disciples said to Him, »Master, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.2'>So He said to them, »When you pray, say, `Father may Thy name be kept holy; let Thy Kingdom come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.3'>give us day after day our bread for the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.4'>and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every one who fails in his duty to us; and bring us not into temptation.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.5'>And He said to them, »Which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him in the middle of the night and say, «`Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>If you then, with all your human frailty, know how to give your children gifts that are good for them, how much more certainly will your Father who is in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>On once occasion He was expelling a dumb demon; and when the demon was gone out the dumb man could speak, and the people were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>But some among them said, »It is by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of the demons, that he expels the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>Others, to put Him to the test, asked Him for a sign in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>And, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, »Every kingdom in which civil war rages goes to ruin: family attacks family and is overthrown.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.13'>Just then a man in the crowd appealed to Him. »Rabbi,« he said, »tell my brother to give me a share of the inheritance.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.18'>»And he said to himself,« `This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and in them I will store up all my harvest and my wealth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.22'>Then turning to His disciples He said, »For this reason I say to you, `Dismiss all anxious care for your lives, inquiring what you are to eat, and for your bodies, what you are to put on.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.24'>Observe the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, and have neither store-chamber nor barn. And yet God feeds them. How far more precious are you than the birds!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.2'>»Do you suppose,« He asked in reply, »that those Galilaeans were worse sinners than the mass of the Galilaeans, because this happened to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.3'>I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you are not penitent you will all perish as they did.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.6'>And He gave them the following parable. »A man,« He said, »who had a fig-tree growing in his garden came to look for fruit on it and could find none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.7'>So he said to the gardener, »`See, this is the third year I have come to look for fruit on this fig-tree and cannot find any. Cut it down. Why should so much ground be actually wasted?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.14'>Then the Warden of the Synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured her on a Sabbath, said to the crowd, »There are six days in the week on which people ought to work. On those days therefore come and get yourselves cured, and not on the Sabbath day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.15'>But the Lord's reply to him was, »Hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his bullock or his ass from the stall and lead him to water?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.14'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.1'>One day –it was a Sabbath– He was taking a meal at the house of one of the Rulers of the Pharisee party, while they were closely watching Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.2'>In front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.3'>This led Jesus to ask the lawyers and Pharisees, »Is it allowable to cure people on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.4'>They gave Him no answer; so He took hold of the man, cured him, and sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.5'>Then He turned to them and said, »Which of you shall have a child or an ox fall into a well on the Sabbath day, and will not immediately lift him out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.6'>To this they could make no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.7'>Then, when He noticed that the invited guests chose the best seats, He used this as an illustration and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.8'>»When any one invites you to a wedding banquet, do not take the best seat, lest perhaps some more honoured guest than you may have been asked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.9'>and the man who invited you both will come and will say to you, `Make room for this guest,' and then you, ashamed, will move to the lowest place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.10'>On the contrary, when you are invited go and take the lowest place, that when your host comes round he may say to you, `My friend, come up higher.' This will be doing you honour in the presence of all the other guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.11'>For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be uplifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.12'>Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, »When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.13'>But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.14'>and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you, but there will be requital for you at the Resurrection of the righteous.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.15'>After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said to Him, »Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.16'>»A man once gave a great dinner,« replied Jesus, »to which he invited a large number of guests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.14.18'>»But they all without exception began to excuse themselves. The first told him,« `I have purchased a piece of land, and must of necessity go and look at it. Pray hold me excused.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.19'>»A second pleaded,« `I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am on my way to try them. Pray hold me excused.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.20'>»Another said,« `I am just married. It is impossible for me to come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.21'>»So the servant came and brought these answers to his master, and they stirred his anger.« `Go out quickly,' he said, `into the streets of the city–the wide ones and the narrow. You will see poor men, and crippled, blind, lame: fetch them all in here.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.22'>»Soon the servant reported the result, saying,« `Sir, what you ordered is done, and there is room still.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.23'>»`Go out,' replied the master, `to the high roads and hedge-rows, and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.24'>For I tell you that not one of those who were invited shall taste my dinner.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.25'>On His journey vast crowds attended Him, towards whom He turned and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.26'>»If any one is coming to me who does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be a disciple of mine.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.14.28'>»Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not sit down first and calculate the cost, asking if he has the means to finish it?« –</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.15'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>Now the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners were everywhere in the habit of coming close to Him to listen to Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>and this led the Pharisees and the Scribes indignantly to complain, saying, »He gives a welcome to notorious sinners, and joins them at their meals!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>So in figurative language He asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>»Which of you men, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in their pasture and go in search of the lost one till he finds it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And when he has found it, he lifts it on his shoulder, glad at heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>Then coming home he calls his friends and neighbours together, and says, `Congratulate me, for I have found my sheep–the one I had lost.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>I tell you that in the same way there will be rejoicing in Heaven over one repentant sinner–more rejoicing than over ninety-nine blameless persons who have no need of repentance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>»I tell you that in the same way there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one repentant sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>He went on to say, »There was a man who had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>The younger of them said to his father, »`Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.' «So he divided his wealth between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>No long time afterwards the younger son got all together and travelled to a distant country, where he wasted his money in debauchery and excess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>At last, when he had spent everything, there came a terrible famine throughout that country, and he began to feel the pinch of want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>So he went and hired himself to one of the inhabitants of that country, who sent him on to his farm to tend swine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>and he longed to make a hearty meal of the pods the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>»But on coming to himself he said,« `How many of my father's hired men have more bread than they want, while I here am dying of hunger!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>»So he rose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>»`Father,' cried the son, `I have sinned against Heaven and before you: no longer do I deserve to be called a son of yours.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>»But the father said to his servants,« `Fetch a good coat quickly –the best one– and put it on him; and bring a ring for his finger and shoes for his feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>»`Your brother has come,' he replied; `and your father has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home safe and sound.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.28'>»Then he was angry and would not go in. But his father came out and entreated him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>»`All these years,' replied the son, `I have been slaving for you, and I have never at any time disobeyed any of your orders, and yet you have never given me so much as a kid, for me to enjoy myself with my friends;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>but now that this son of yours is come who has eaten up your property among his bad women, you have killed the fat calf for him.'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>He said also to His disciples: »There was a rich man who had a steward, about whom a report was brought to him, that he was wasting his property.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>»Then the steward said within himself,« `What am I to do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I am not strong enough for field labour: to beg, I should be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I see what to do, in order that when I am discharged from the stewardship they may give me a home in their own houses.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>»So he called all his master's debtors, one by one, and asked the first, `How much are you in debt to my master?'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>»`A hundred firkins of oil,' he replied.« `Here is your account,' said the steward: `sit down quickly and change it into fifty firkins.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>»And the master praised the dishonest steward for his shrewdness; for, in relation to their own contemporaries, the men of this age are shrewder than the sons of Light.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>»But I charge you, so to use the wealth which is ever tempting to dishonesty as to win friends who, when it fails, shall welcome you to the tents that never perish.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>»In a certain town,« He said, »there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And in the same town was a widow who repeatedly came and entreated him, saying, »`Give me justice and stop my oppressor.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>»For a time he would not, but afterwards he said to himself,« `Though I have neither reverence for God nor respect for man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because she annoys me I will give her justice, to prevent her from constantly coming to pester me.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, »Hear those words of the unjust judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God avenge the wrongs of His own People who cry aloud to Him day and night, although He seems slow in taking action on their behalf?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>Yes, He will soon avenge their wrongs. Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And to some who relied on themselves as being righteous men, and looked down upon all others, He addressed this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>»Two men went up to the Temple to pray,« He said; »one being a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee, standing erect, prayed as follows by himself: »`O God, I thank Thee that I am not like other people–I am not a thief nor a cheat nor an adulterer, nor do I even resemble this tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week. I pay the tithe on all my gains.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>»But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not so much as lift his eyes to Heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying,« `O God, be reconciled to me, sinner that I am.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>»I tell you that this man went home more thoroughly absolved from guilt than the other; for every one who uplifts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be uplifted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>On one occasion people also brought with them their infants, for Him to touch them; but the disciples, noticing this, proceeded to find fault with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>Jesus however called the infants to Him. »Let the little children come to me,« He said; »do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of God belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>I tell you in solemn truth that, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will certainly not enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>The question was put to Him by a Ruler:»Good Rabbi, what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>»Why do you call me good?« replied Jesus; »there is no one good but One, namely God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the Commandments: `Do not commit adultery;' `Do not murder;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;' `Honour thy father and thy mother.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>»All of those,« he replied, »I have kept from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>On receiving this answer Jesus said to him, »There is still one thing wanting in you. Sell everything you possess and give the money to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and then come, follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But on hearing these words he was deeply sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>Jesus saw his sorrow, and said, »With how hard a struggle do the possessors of riches ever enter the Kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>Why, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>»Who then can be saved?« exclaimed the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>»Things impossible with man,« He replied, »are possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, »See, we have given up our homes and have followed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>»I solemnly tell you,« replied Jesus, »that there is no one who has left house or wife, or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of God's Kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who shall not certainly receive many times as much in this life, and in the age that is coming the Life of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Then He drew the Twelve to Him and said, »See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written in the Prophets which refers to the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For He will be given up to the Gentiles, and be mocked, outraged and spit upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>They will scourge Him and put Him to death, and on the third day He will rise to life again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>Nothing of this did they understand. The words were a mystery to them, nor could they see what He meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>As Jesus came near to Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the way-side begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>He heard a crowd of people going past, and inquired what it all meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>»Jesus the Nazarene is passing by,« they told him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>Then, at the top of his voice, he cried out, »Jesus, son of David, take pity on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>Those in front reproved him and tried to silence him; but he continued shouting, louder than ever, »Son of David, take pity on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>At length Jesus stopped and desired them to bring the man to Him; and when he had come close to Him He asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>»What shall I do for you?« »Sir,« he replied, »let me recover my sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>»Recover your sight,« said Jesus:»your faith has cured you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>No sooner were the words spoken than the man regained his sight and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>So He entered Jericho and was passing through the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>There was a man there called Zacchaeus, who was the local surveyor of taxes, and was wealthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>He was anxious to see what sort of man Jesus was; but he could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran on in front and climbed up a mulberry tree to see Him; for He was about to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>As soon as Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house to-day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he came down in haste, and welcomed Him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>When they all saw this, they began to complain with indignation. »He has gone in to be the guest of a notorious sinner!« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Zacchaeus however stood up, and addressing the Lord said, »Here and now, Master, I give half my property to the poor, and if I have unjustly exacted money from any man, I pledge myself to repay to him four times the amount.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>Turning towards him, Jesus replied, »To-day salvation has come to this house, seeing that he too is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As they were listening to His words, He went on to teach them by a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>So He said to them, »A man of noble family travelled to a distant country to obtain the rank of king, and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And he called ten of his servants and gave each of them a pound, instructing them to trade with the money during his absence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>»Now his countrymen hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, `We are not willing that he should become our king.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty, he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money to be summoned before him, that he might learn their success in trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>»So the first came and said,« `Sir, your pound has produced ten pounds more.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>»`Well done, good servant,' he replied; `because you have been faithful in a very small matter, be in authority over ten towns.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>»The second came, and said,« `Your pound, Sir, has produced five pounds.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>»So he said to this one also,« `And you, be the governor of five towns.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>»The next came.« `Sir,' he said, `here is your pound, which I have kept wrapt up in a cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>»`By your own words,' he replied, `I will judge you, you bad servant. You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I came I might have received it back with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>»And he said to those who stood by,« `Take the pound from him and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>(They said to him, »`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>»`I tell you that to every one who has anything, more shall be given; and from him who has not anything, even what he has shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I should become their king, bring them here, and cut them to pieces in my presence.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying to them, »Go into the village facing you. On entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie it, and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?' simply say, `The Master needs it.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And while they were untying the colt the owners called out, »Why are you untying the colt?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>and they replied, »The Master needs it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty deeds they had witnessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>»Blessed is the King,« they cried, »who comes in the name of the Lord: in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him, saying, »Rabbi, reprove your disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>»I tell you,« He replied, »that if they became silent, the very stones would cry out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud over it, and exclaimed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>»O that at this time thou hadst known –yes even thou– what makes peace possible! But now it is hid from thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming thee in on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee, and will not leave one stone upon another within thee; because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive out the dealers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>»It is written,« He said, »`And My house shall be the House of Prayer,' but you have made it a robbers' cave.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him, as were also the leading men of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>But they could not find any way of doing it, for the people all hung upon His lips.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>On one of those days while He was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Good News, the High Priests came upon Him, and the Scribes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>together with the Elders, and they asked Him, »Tell us, By what authority are you doing these things? And who is it that gave you this authority?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>»I also will put a question to you,« He said;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>»was John's baptism of Heavenly or of human origin?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>So they debated the matter with one another. »If we say `Heavenly,'« they argued, »he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us; for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>»Nor will I tell you,« said Jesus, »by what authority I do these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people. »There was a man,« He said, »who planted a vineyard, let it out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>At vintage-time he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>Then he sent a second servant; and him too they beat and ill treated and sent away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded and drove away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, »`What am I to do? I will send my son–my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>»But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed the matter with one another, and said,« `This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>»So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give the vineyard to others.« »God forbid!« exclaimed the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>He looked at them and said, »What then does that mean which is written, »`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt, but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands on Him, then and there; only they were afraid of the people. For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent spies who were to act the part of good and honest men, that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>So they put a question to Him. »Rabbi,« they said, »we know that you say and teach what is right and that you make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach God's way truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it allowable to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But He saw through their knavery and replied,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>»Show me a shilling; whose likeness and inscription does it bear?« »Caesar's,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>»Pay therefore,« He replied, »what is Caesar's to Caesar–and what is God's to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>There was nothing here that they could lay hold of before the people, and marvelling at His answer they said no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>»Rabbi, Moses made it a law for us that if a man's brother should die, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. The first of them took a wife and died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>The second and the third also took her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and all seven, having done the same, left no children when they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Finally the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>The woman, then –at the Resurrection– whose wife shall she be? for they all seven married her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>»The men of this age,« replied Jesus, »marry, and the women are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But as for those who shall have been deemed worthy to find a place in that other age and in the Resurrection from among the dead, the men do not marry and the women are not given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>For indeed they cannot die again; they are like angels, and are sons of God through being sons of the Resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead rise to life even Moses clearly implies in the passage about the Bush, where he calls the Lord `The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>He is not a God of dead, but of living men, for to Him are all living.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the Scribes replied, »Rabbi, you have spoken well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>From that time, however, no one ventured to challenge Him with a single question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But He asked them, »How is it they say that the Christ is a son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>Until I have made thy foes a footstool under they feet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>»David himself therefore calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>»Beware of the Scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love to be bowed to in places of public resort and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues or at a dinner party;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who swallow up the property of widows and mask their wickedness by making long prayers. They will be punished far more severely than others.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Looking up He saw the people throwing their gifts into the Treasury–the rich people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>He also saw a poor widow dropping in two farthings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>and He said, »In truth I tell you that this widow, so poor, has thrown in more than any of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>For from what they could well spare they have all of them contributed to the offerings, but she in her need has thrown in all she had to live on.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>When some were remarking about the Temple, how it was embellished with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts, He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>»As to these things which you now admire, the time is coming when there will not be one stone left here upon another which will not be pulled down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>»Rabbi, when will this be?« they asked Him, »and what will be the token given when these things are about to take place?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>»See to it,« He replied, »that you are not misled; for many will come assuming my name and professing, `I am He,' or saying, `The time is close at hand.' Do not go and follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>But when you hear of wars and turmoils, be not afraid; for these things must happen first, but the end does not come immediately.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then He said to them, »Nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there will be great earthquakes, and in places famines and pestilence; and there will be terrible sights and wonderful tokens from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>»But before all these things happen they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you up to synagogues and to prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my sake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>In the end all this will be evidence of your fidelity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>»Make up your minds, however, not to prepare a defence beforehand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to withstand or reply to.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends; and some of you they will put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>You will be the objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>and yet not a hair of your heads shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>By your patient endurance you will purchase your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>»But when you see Jerusalem with armies encamping round her on every side, then be certain that her overthrow is close at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then let those who shall be in Judaea escape to the hills; let those who are in the city leave it, and those who are in the country not enter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.22'>For those are the days of vengeance and of fulfilling all that is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>»Alas for the women who at that time are with child or who have infants; for there will be great distress in the land, and anger towards this People.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>They will fall by the sword, or be carried off into slavery among all the Gentiles. And Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles, till the appointed times of the Gentiles have expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>»There will be signs in sun, moon, and stars; and on earth anguish among the nations in their bewilderment at the roaring of the sea and its billows;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>while men's hearts are fainting for fear, and for anxious expectation of what is coming on the world. For the forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>And then will they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>But when all this is beginning to take place, grieve no longer. Lift up your heads, because your deliverance is drawing near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>And He spoke a parable to them. »See,« He said, »the fig-tree and all the trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>As soon as they have shot out their leaves, you know at a glance that summer is now near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>So also, when you see these things happening, you may be sure that the Kingdom of God is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>»But take heed to yourselves, lest your souls be weighed down with self-indulgence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life, and that day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>for it will come on all dwellers on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>But beware of slumbering; and every moment pray that you may be fully strengthened to escape from all these coming evils, and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>His habit at this time was to teach in the Temple by day, but to go out and spend the night on the Mount called the Oliveyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.38'>And all the people came to Him in the Temple, early in the morning, to listen to Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Meanwhile the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>and the High Priests and the Scribes were contriving how to destroy Him. But they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Satan, however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot) who was one of the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>He went and conferred with the High Priests and Commanders as to how he should deliver Him up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity to betray Him when the people were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>When the day of the Unleavened Bread came –the day for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions. »Go,« He said, »and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>»Where shall we prepare it?« they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>»You will no sooner have entered the city,« He replied, »than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house to which he goes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>and say to the master of the house, »`The Rabbi asks you, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>»And he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. There make your preparations.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the time was come, and He had taken His place at table, and the Apostles with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>He said to them, »Earnestly have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>for I tell you that I certainly shall not eat one again till its full meaning has been brought out in the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then, having received the cup and given thanks, He said, »Take this and share it among yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>for I tell you that from this time I will never drink the produce of the vine till the Kingdom of God has come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>Then, taking a Passover biscuit, He gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is being given on your behalf: this do in remembrance of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>He gave them the cup in like manner, when the meal was over. »This cup,« He said, »is the new Covenant ratified by my blood which is to be poured out on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>Yet the hand of him who is betraying me is at the table with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>For indeed the Son of Man goes on His way–His pre-destined way; yet alas for that man who is betraying Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them it could possibly be who was about to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be regarded as greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>But He said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles are their masters, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>With you it is not so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and the leader be like him who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For which is the greater–he who sits at table, or he who waits on him? Is it not he who sits at table? But my position among you is that of one who waits on others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You however have remained with me amid my trials;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted to give me, a Kingdom–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>»Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has obtained permission to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail, and you, when at last you have come back to your true self, must strengthen your brethren.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>»Master,« replied Peter, »with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>»I tell you, Peter,« said Jesus, »that the cock will not crow to-day till you have three times denied that you know me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Then He asked them, »When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, was there anything you needed?«»No, nothing,« they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>»But now,« said He, »let the one who has a purse take it, and he who has a bag must do the same. And let him who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their fulfilment in me: `And He was reckoned among the lawless'; for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>»Master, here are two swords,« they exclaimed. »That is enough,« He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>But when He arrived at the place, He said to them, »Pray that you may not come into temptation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>»Father, if it be Thy will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will but Thine be done!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>while He –an agony of distress having come upon Him– prayed all the more with intense earnestness, and His sweat became like clots of blood dropping on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>»Why are you sleeping?« He said; »stand up; and pray that you may not come into temptation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head. He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>»Judas,« said Jesus, »are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen, asked Him, »Master, shall we strike with the sword?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck a blow at the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>»Permit me thus far,« said Jesus. And He touched the ear and healed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, »Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour–and the power of darkness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was sitting among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>when a maidservant saw him sitting by the fire, and, looking fixedly at him, she said, »This man also was with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied it, and declared, »Woman, I do not know him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, »You, too, are one of them.«»No, man, I am not,« said Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained:»Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact he is a Galilaean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>»Man, I don't know what you mean,« replied Peter. No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected the Master's words, how He had said to him, »This very day, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat Him in cruel sport,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him. »Prove to us,« they said, »that you are a prophet, by telling us who it was that struck you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they said many other insulting things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders, both High Priests and Scribes, assembled. Then He was brought into their Sanhedrin, and they asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>»Are you the Christ? Tell us.« »If I tell you,« He replied, »you will certainly not believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of God's omnipotence.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Thereupon they cried out with one voice, »You, then, are the Son of God?«»It is as you say,« He answered; »I am He.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>»What need have we of further evidence?« they said; »for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole assembly rose and brought Him to Pilate, and began to accuse Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>»We have found this man,« they said, »an agitator among our nation, forbidding the payment of tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be himself an anointed king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked Him, »You, then, are the King of the Jews?«»It is as you say,« He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the High Priests and to the crowd, »I can find no crime in this man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they violently insisted. »He stirs up the people,« they said, »throughout all Judaea with His teaching–even from Galilee (where He first started) to this city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>On hearing this, Pilate inquired, »Is this man a Galilaean?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And learning that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he sent Him to Herod, for he too was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>To Herod the sight of Jesus was a great gratification, for, for a long time, he had been wanting to see Him, because he had heard so much about Him. He hoped also to see some miracle performed by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave him no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Meanwhile the High Priests and the Scribes were standing there and vehemently accusing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then, laughing to scorn the claims of Jesus, Herod (and his soldiers with him) made sport of Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous costume, and sent Him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And on that very day Herod and Pilate became friends again, for they had been for some time at enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Then calling together the High Priests and the Rulers and the people, Pilate said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>»You have brought this man to me on a charge of corrupting the loyalty of the people. But, you see, I have examined him in your presence and have discovered in the man no ground for the accusations which you bring against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>No, nor does Herod; for he has sent him back to us; and, you see, there is nothing he has done that deserves death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>Then the whole multitude burst out into a shout. »Away with this man,« they said, »and release Barabbas to us«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>–Barabbas! who had been lodged in jail for some time in connexion with a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>But Pilate once more addressed them, wishing to set Jesus free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>They, however, persistently shouted, »Crucify, crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>A third time he appealed to them: »Why, what crime has the man committed? I have discovered in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they urgently insisted, demanding with frantic outcries that He should be crucified; and their clamour prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate gave judgement, yielding to their demand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>The man who was lying in prison charged with riot and murder and for whom they clamoured he set free, but Jesus he gave up to be dealt with as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, and on his shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>A vast crowd of the people also followed Him, and of women who were beating their breasts and wailing for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turned towards them and said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For a time is coming when they will say, `Blessed are the women who never bore children, and the breasts which have never given nourishment.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then will they begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us;' and to the hills, `Cover us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they are doing these things in the case of the green tree, what will be done in that of the dry?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>They brought also two others, criminals, to put them to death with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they reached the place called `The Skull,' there they nailed Him to the cross, and the criminals also, one at His right hand and one at His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus prayed, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.« And they divided His garments among them, drawing lots for them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>and the people stood looking on. The Rulers, too, repeatedly uttered their bitter taunts. »This fellow,« they said, »saved others: let him save himself, if he is God's Anointed, the Chosen One.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also made sport of Him, coming and offering Him sour wine and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>»Are you the King of the Jews? Save yourself, then!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was moreover a writing over His head: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Now one of the criminals who had been crucified insulted Him, saying, »Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other, answering, reproved him. »Do you also not fear God,« he said, »when you are actually suffering the same punishment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving due requital for what we have done. But He has done nothing amiss.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come in your Kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>»I tell you in solemn truth,« replied Jesus, »that this very day you shall be with me in Paradise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was now about noon, and a darkness came over the whole country till three o'clock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn down the middle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and said, »Father, to Thy hands I entrust my spirit.« And after uttering these words He yielded up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>The Captain, seeing what had happened, gave glory to God, saying, »Beyond question this man was innocent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds that had come together to this sight, after seeing all that had occurred, returned to the city beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all His acquaintances, and the women who had been His followers after leaving Galilee, continued standing at a distance and looking on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>There was a member of the Council of the name of Joseph, a kind-hearted and upright man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>who came from the Jewish town of Arimathaea and was awaiting the coming of the Kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the design or action of the Council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>and now he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>Then, taking it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet and laid it in a tomb in the rock, where no one else had yet been put.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was near at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>The women –those who had come with Jesus from Galilee– followed close behind, and saw the tomb and how His body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they returned, and prepared spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the Commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and on entering they found that the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>At this they were in great perplexity, when suddenly there stood by them two men whose raiment flashed like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>The women were terrified; but, as they stood with their faces bowed to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you search among the dead for Him who is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here. He has come back to life. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered His words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>The women were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this to the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could not believe the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw nothing but the linen cloths: so he went away to his own home, wondering at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and were conversing about all these recent events;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion, Jesus Himself came and joined them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>though they were prevented from recognizing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>»What is the subject,« He asked them, »on which you are talking so earnestly, as you walk?« And they stood still, looking full of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered, »Are you a stranger lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing of the things that have lately happened in the city?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>»What things?« He asked. »The things about Jesus the Nazarene,« they said, »who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel. Yes, and moreover it was the day before yesterday that these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us. They went to the tomb at daybreak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>»O dull-witted men,« He replied, »with minds so slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer, and then enter into His glory?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>When they had come near the village to which they were going, He appeared to be going further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they pressed Him to remain with them. »Because,« said they, »it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over.« So He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the bread and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. But He vanished from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>»Were not our hearts,« they said to one another, »burning within us while He talked to us on the way and explained the Scriptures to us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem, and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>»Yes, it is true: the Master has come back to life. He has been seen by Simon.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He had been recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst and said, »Peace be to you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were looking at a spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>but He said to them, »Why such alarm? And why are there such questionings in your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet–it is my very self. Feel me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And then He showed them His hands and His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full of astonishment, He asked them, »Have you any food here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave Him a piece of roasted fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and He took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And He said to them, »This is what I told you while I was still with you–that everything must be fulfilled that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and He said, »Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise again from among the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that proclamation would be made, in His name, of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses as to these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised gift to rest upon you. But, as for you, wait patiently in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And He brought them out to within view of Bethany, and then lifted up His hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>Afterwards they were continually in attendance at the Temple, blessing God.</verse>
