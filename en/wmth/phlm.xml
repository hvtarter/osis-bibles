      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to our sister Apphia and our comrade Archippus–as well as to the Church in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>May grace be granted to you all, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I give continual thanks to my God while making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest towards all God's people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>praying as I do, that their participation in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right affection that is in us toward Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have found great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of God's people have been, and are, refreshed through you, my brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might with Christ's authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>it is for love's sake that –instead of that– although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father I have become while in my chains–I mean Onesimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Formerly he was useless to you, but now –true to his name– he is of great use to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back to you, though in so doing I send part of myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>It was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment for the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>Only I wished to do nothing without your consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure, but might be a voluntary one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps it was for this reason he was parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave–a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if he were I myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>And if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt, debit me with the amount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul write this with my own hand–I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, do me this favour for the Lord's sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>I write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>And at the same time provide accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be permitted to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Greetings to you, my brother, from Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit of every one of you.</verse>
