      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet, »See, I am sending My messenger before Thee, Who will prepare Thy way«;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>»The voice of one crying aloud: `In the Desert prepare a road for the Lord: Make His highways straight.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>So John the Baptizer came, and was in the Desert proclaiming a baptism of the penitent for forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>There went out to him people of all classes from Judaea, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem of all ranks, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, making open confession of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>As for John, his garment was of camel's hair, and he wore a loincloth of leather; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>His announcement was, »There is One coming after me mightier than I–One whose sandal-strap I am unworthy to stoop down and unfasten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>and immediately on His coming up out of the water He saw an opening in the sky, and the Spirit like a dove coming down to Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and a voice came from the sky, saying, »Thou art My Son dearly loved: in Thee is My delight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>At once the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the Desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>where He remained for forty days, tempted by Satan; and He was among the wild beasts, but the angels waited upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Then, after John had been thrown into prison, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming God's Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>»The time has fully come,« He said, »and the Kingdom of God is close at hand: repent, and believe this Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>One day, passing along the shore of the Lake of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, throwing their nets in the Lake; for they were fisherman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>»Come and follow me,« said Jesus, »and I will make you fishers for men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>At once they left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Going on a little further He saw James the son of Zabdi and his brother John: they also were in the boat mending the nets, and He immediately called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>They therefore left their father Zabdi in the boat with the hired men, and went and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>So they came to Capernaum, and on the next Sabbath He went to the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>The people listened with amazement to His teaching –for there was authority about it: it was very different from that of the Scribes–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>when all at once, there in their synagogue, a man under the power of a foul spirit screamed out:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>»What have you to do with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are–God's Holy One.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus reprimanded him, saying, »Silence! come out of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>So the foul spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions, came out of him with a loud cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And all were amazed and awe-struck, so they began to ask one another, »What does this mean? Here is a new sort of teaching–and a tone of authority! And even to foul spirits he issues orders and they obey him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And His fame spread at once everywhere in all that part of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>Then on leaving the synagogue they came at once, with James and John, to the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill in bed with a fever, and without delay they informed Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>So He went to her, and taking her hand He raised her to her feet: the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>When it was evening, after sunset people came bringing Him all who were sick and the demoniacs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole town was assembled at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>Then He cured numbers of people who were ill with various diseases, and He drove out many demons; not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>In the morning He rose early, while it was still quite dark, and leaving the house He went away to a solitary place and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and the others searched everywhere for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found Him they said, »Every one is looking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>»Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns,« He replied, »that I may proclaim my Message there also; because for that purpose I came from God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And He went through all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and expelling the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>One day there came a leper to Jesus entreating Him, and pleading on his knees. »If you are willing,« he said, »you are able to cleanse me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Moved with pity Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. »I am willing,« He said; »be cleansed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>The leprosy at once left him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Jesus at once sent him away, strictly charging him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and saying, »Be careful not to tell any one, but go and show yourself to the Priest, and for your purification present the offerings that Moses appointed as evidence for them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man, when he went out, began to tell every one and to publish the matter abroad, so that it was no longer possible for Jesus to go openly into any town; but He had to remain outside in unfrequented places, where people came to Him from all parts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>After some days He entered Capernaum again, and it soon became known that He was at home;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and such numbers of people came together that there was no longer room for them even round the door. He was speaking His Message to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>when there came a party of people bringing a paralytic–four men carrying him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>Finding themselves unable, however, to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they untiled the roof just over His head, and after clearing an opening they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, »My son, your sins are pardoned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>»Why does this man use such words?« they said; »he is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One–that is, God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>At once perceiving by His spirit that they were reasoning within themselves, Jesus asked them, »Why do you thus argue in your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier?–to say to this paralytic, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, `Rise, take up your mat, and walk?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins« –He turned to the paralytic, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>»To you I say, `Rise, take up your mat and go home.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>The man rose, and immediately under the eyes of all took up his mat and went out, so that they were all filled with astonishment, gave the glory to God, and said, »We never saw anything like this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Again He went out to the shore of the Lake, and the whole multitude kept coming to Him, and He taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>When He was sitting at table in Levi's house, a large number of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners were at table with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many such who habitually followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>But when the Scribes of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with the sinners and the tax-gatherers, they said to His disciples, »He is eating and drinking with the tax-gatherers and sinners!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus heard the words, and He said, »It is not the healthy who require a doctor, but the sick: I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>(Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were keeping a fast.) And they came and asked Him, »How is it that John's disciples and those of the Pharisees are fasting, and yours are not?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>»Can a wedding party fast while the bridegroom is among them?« replied Jesus. »So long as they have the bridegroom with them, fasting is impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But a time will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one mends an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away from it– the new from the old– and a worse hole would be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine needs fresh skins!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>One Sabbath He was walking through the wheatfields when His disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>So the Pharisees said to Him, »Look! why are they doing what on the Sabbath is unlawful?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>»Have you never read,« Jesus replied, »what David did when the necessity arose and he and his men were hungry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the house of God in the High-priesthood of Abiathar, and ate the Presented Loaves –which none but the priests are allowed to eat– and gave some to his men also?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And Jesus said to them: »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>At another time, when He went to the synagogue, there was a man there with one arm shrivelled up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>They closely watched Him to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath–so as to have a charge to bring against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>»Come forward,« said He to the man with the shrivelled arm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then He asked them, »Are we allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? to save a life, or to destroy one?« They remained silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>Grieved and indignant at the hardening of their hearts, He looked round on them with anger, and said to the man, »Stretch out your arm.« He stretched it out, and the arm was completely restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>But no sooner had the Pharisees left the synagogue than they held a consultation with the Herodians against Jesus, to devise some means of destroying Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Accordingly Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the Lake, and a vast crowd of people from Galilee followed Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Judaea and Jerusalem and Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the district of Tyre and Sidon there came to Him a vast crowd, hearing of all that He was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>So He gave directions to His disciples to keep a small boat in constant attendance on Him because of the throng–to prevent their crushing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For He had cured many of the people, so that all who had any ailments pressed upon Him, to touch Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the foul spirits, whenever they saw Him, threw themselves down at His feet, screaming out:»You are the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But He many a time checked them, forbidding them to say who He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then He went up the hill; and those whom He Himself chose He called, and they came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve of them, that they might be with Him, and that He might also send them to proclaim His Message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>with authority to expel the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>These twelve were Simon (to whom He gave the surname of Peter),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zabdi and John the brother of James (these two He surnamed Boanerges, that is `Sons of Thunder'),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, the man who also betrayed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And He went into a house. But again the crowd assembled, so that there was no opportunity for them even to snatch a meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>Hearing of this, His relatives came to seize Him by force, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The Scribes, too, who had come down from Jerusalem said, »He has Baal-zebul in him; and it is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he expels the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>So He called them to Him, and using figurative language He appealed to them, saying, »How is it possible for Satan to expel Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>For if civil war breaks out in a kingdom, nothing can make that kingdom last;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a family splits into parties, that family cannot continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>So if Satan has risen in arms and has made war upon himself, stand he cannot, but meets his end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>Nay, no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>In solemn truth I tell you that all their sins may be pardoned to the sons of men, and all their blasphemies, however they may have blasphemed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he remains for ever unabsolved: he is guilty of a sin of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>This was because they said, »He is possessed by a foul spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing outside they send a message to Him to call Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>Now a crowd was sitting round Him; so they tell Him, »Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, inquiring for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>»Who are my mother and my brothers?« He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And, fixing His eyes on the people who were sitting round Him in a circle, He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>»Here are my mother and my brothers. For wherever there is one who has been obedient to God, there is my brother –my sister– and my mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Once more He began to teach by the side of the Lake, and a vast multitude of people came together to listen to Him. He therefore went on board the boat and sat there, a little way from the land; and all the people were on the shore close to the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>Then He proceeded to teach them many lessons in figurative language; and in His teaching He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>»Listen: the sower goes out to sow.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Some falls on the rocky ground where it finds but little earth, and it shoots up quickly because it has no depth of soil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun is risen, it is scorched, and through having no root it withers away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Some, again, falls among the thorns; and the thorns spring up and stifle it, so that it yields no crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But some of the seed falls into good ground, and gives a return: it comes up and increases, and yields thirty, sixty, or a hundred-fold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>»Listen,« He added, »every one who has ears to listen with!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When He was alone, the Twelve and the others who were about Him requested Him to explain His figurative language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>»To you,« He replied, »has been entrusted the secret truth concerning the Kingdom of God; but to those others outside your number all this is spoken in figurative language;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that »`They may look and look but not see, and listen and listen but not understand, lest perchance they should return and be pardoned.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>»Do you all miss the meaning of this parable?« He added; »how then will you understand the rest of my parables?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>»What the sower sows is the Message.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>Those who receive the seed by the way-side are those in whom the Message is sown, but, when they have heard it, Satan comes at once and carries away the Message sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>In the same way those who receive the seed on the rocky places are those who, when they have heard the Message, at once accept it joyfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but they have no root within them. They last for a time; then, when suffering or persecution comes because of the Message, they are immediately overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>Others there are who receive the seed among the thorns: these are they who have heard the Message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but worldly cares and the deceitfulness of wealth and the excessive pursuit of other objects come in and stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>Those, on the other hand, who have received the seed on the good ground, are all who hear the Message and welcome it, and yield a return of thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He went on to say, »Is the lamp brought in in order to be put under the bushel or under the bed? Is it not rather in order that it may be placed on the lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>Why, there is nothing hidden except with a view to its being ultimately disclosed, nor has anything been made a secret but that it may at last come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>He also said to them, »Take care what you hear. With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and that with interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For those who have will have more given them; and from those who have not, even what they have will be taken away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>Another saying of His was this: »The Kingdom of God is as if a man scattered seed over the ground:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>he spends days and nights, now awake, now asleep, while the seed sprouts and grows tall, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>Of itself the land produces the crop– first the blade, then the ear; afterwards the perfect grain is seen in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But no sooner is the crop ripe, than he sends the reapers, because the time of harvest has come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>Another saying of His was this: »How are we to picture the Kingdom of God? or by what figure of speech shall we represent it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the earth, is the smallest of all the seeds in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when sown it springs up and becomes larger than all the herbs, and throws out great branches, so that the birds build under its shadow.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such parables He used to speak the Message to them according to their capacity for receiving it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them; while to His own disciples He expounded everything, in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>The same day, in the evening, He said to them, »Let us cross to the other side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>So they got away from the crowd, and took Him –as He was– in the boat; and other boats accompanied Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>But a heavy squall came on, and the waves were now dashing into the boat, so that it was fast filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But He Himself was in the stern asleep, with His head on the cushion: so they woke Him. »Rabbi,« they cried, »is it nothing to you that we are drowning?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>So He roused Himself and rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, »Silence! Be still!« The wind sank, and a perfect calm set in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>»Why are you so timid?« He asked; »have you still no faith?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>Then they were filled with terror, and began to say to one another, »Who is this, then? For even wind and sea obey Him.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>So they arrived at the opposite shore of the Lake, in the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>At once, on His landing, there came from the tombs to meet Him a man possessed by a foul spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>This man lived among the tombs, nor could any one now secure him even with a chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for many a time he had been left securely bound in fetters and chains, but afterwards the chains lay torn link from link, and the fetters in fragments, and there was no one strong enough to master him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And constantly, day and night, he remained among the tombs or on the hills, shrieking, and mangling himself with sharp stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus in the distance, he ran and threw himself at His feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>crying out in a loud voice, »What hast Thou to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? In God's name I implore Thee not to torment me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For He had said to him, »Foul spirit, come out of the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Jesus also questioned him. »What is your name?« He said. »Legion,« he replied, »for there are a host of us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So they besought Jesus. »Send us to the swine,« they said, »so that we may enter into them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered into the swine, and the herd –about 2,000 in number– rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned in the Lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country. So the people came to see what it was that had happened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated, clothed and of sane mind– the man who had had the legion; and they were awe-stricken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked permission to accompany Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But He would not allow it. »Go home to your family,« He said, »and report to them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue –he was called Jair– who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and besought Him with many entreaties. »My little daughter,« he said, »is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands upon her, that she may recover and live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she said, »If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>In a moment the flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself that her complaint was cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked, »Who touched my clothes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>»You see the multitude pressing you on all sides,« His disciples exclaimed, »and yet you ask, `Who touched me?'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet, and told Him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>»Daughter,« He said, »your faith has cured you: go in peace, and be free from your complaint.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, »Your daughter is dead: why trouble the Rabbi further?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, overhearing the words, said to the Warden, »Do not be afraid; only have faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and the brothers James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>So they come to the Warden's house. Here He gazes on a scene of uproar, with people weeping aloud and wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>He goes in. »Why all this outcry and loud weeping?« He asks; »the child is asleep, not dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>To this their reply is a scornful laugh. He, however, puts them all out, takes the child's father and mother and those He has brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, »Talitha, koum;« that is to say, »Little girl, I command you to wake!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk (for she was twelve years old). They were at once beside themselves with utter astonishment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Leaving that place He came into His own country, accompanied by His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>On the Sabbath He proceeded to teach in the synagogue; and many, as they heard Him, were astonished. »Where did he acquire all this?« they asked. »What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And what are these marvellous miracles which his hands perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, Mary's son, the brother of James and Joses, Jude and Simon? And do not his sisters live here among us?« So they turned angrily away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, »There is no Prophet without honour except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And He could not do any miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few who were out of health and cured them; and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He wondered at their unbelief. So He went round the adjacent villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He charged them to take nothing for the journey except a stick; no bread, no bag, and not a penny in their pockets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to go wearing sandals. »And do not,« He said, »put on an extra under garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>Wherever you enter a house, make it your home till you leave that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>But wherever they will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the very dust from under your feet to bear witness concerning them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>So they set out, and preached in order that men might repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>Many demons they expelled, and many invalids they anointed with oil and cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard of all this (for the name of Jesus had become widely known), and he kept saying, »John the Baptizer has come back to life, and that is why these miraculous Powers are working in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others asserted that He was Elijah. Others again said, »He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard of Him, he said, »The John, whom I beheaded, has come back to life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and had had John arrested and had kept him in prison in chains, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had repeatedly told Herod, »You have no right to be living with your brother's wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Therefore Herodias hated him and wished to take his life, but could not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod stood in awe of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and he protected him. After listening to him he was in great perplexity, and yet he found a pleasure in listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>At length Herodias found her opportunity. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to the nobles of his court and to the tribunes and the principal people in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>at which Herodias's own daughter came in and danced, and so charmed Herod and his guests that he said to her, »Ask me for anything you please, and I will give it to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He even swore to her, »Whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>She at once went out and said to her mother:»What shall I ask for?«»The head of John the Baptizer,« she replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>The girl immediately came in, in haste, to the King and made her request. »My desire is,« she said, »that you will give me, here and now, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>Then the King, though intensely sorry, yet for the sake of his oaths, and of his guests, would not break faith with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>He at once sent a soldier of his guard with orders to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a dish and gave it to the young girl, who gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported to Him all they had done and all they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>Then He said to them, »Come away, all of you, to a quiet place, and rest awhile.« For there were many coming and going, so that they had no time even for meals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But the people saw them going, and many knew them; and coming by land they ran together there from all the neighbouring towns, and arrived before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>So when Jesus landed, He saw a vast multitude; and His heart was moved with pity for them, because they were like sheep which have no shepherd, and He proceeded to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said, »This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near here and buy themselves something to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>»Give them food yourselves,« He replied. »Are we,« they asked, `to go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread and give them food?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>»How many loaves have you?« He inquired; »go and see.« So they found out, and said, »Five; and a couple of fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they sat down in rows of hundreds and of fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and lifting His eyes to Heaven He blessed the food. Then He broke the loaves into portions which He went on handing to the disciples to distribute; giving pieces also of the two fish to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>All ate and were fully satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they carried away broken portions enough to fill twelve baskets, besides pieces of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Those who ate the bread were 5,000 adult men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board the boat and cross over to Bethsaida, leaving Him behind to dismiss the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake, while he Himself was on shore alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them), towards morning He came towards them walking on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. »There is no danger,« He said; »it is I; be not alarmed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside themselves with silent amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they had not learned the lesson taught by the loaves, but their minds were dull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and came to anchor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people immediately recognized Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And enter wherever He might –village or town or hamlet– they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe; and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then the Pharisees, with certain Scribes who had come from Jerusalem, came to Him in a body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They had noticed that some of His disciples were eating their food with `unclean' (that is to say, unwashed) hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews– being, as they are, zealous for the traditions of the Elders– never eat without first carefully washing their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and when they come from market they will not eat without bathing first; and they have a good many other customs which they have received traditionally and cling to, such as the rinsing of cups and pots and of bronze utensils, and the washing of beds.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>So the Pharisees and Scribes put the question to Him:»Why do your disciples transgress the traditions of the Elders, and eat their food with unclean hands?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>»Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,« He replied; »as it is written,« `This People honour Me with their lips, while their hearts are far away from Me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>But idle is their devotion while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>»You neglect God's Commandment: you hold fast to men's traditions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>»Praiseworthy indeed!« He added, »to set at nought God's Commandment in order to observe your own traditions!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, `Honour thy father and thy mother' and again, `He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, `If a man says to his father or mother, It is a Korban (that is, a thing devoted to God), whatever it is, which otherwise you would have received from me–'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>And so you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus nullifying God's precept by your tradition which you have handed down. And many things of that kind you do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>Then Jesus called the people to Him again. »Listen to me, all of you,« He said, »and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing outside a man which entering him can make him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man that make him unclean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples began to ask Him about this figure of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>»Have you also so little understanding?« He replied; »do you not understand that anything whatever that enters a man from outside cannot make him unclean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and passes away ejected from him?« By these words Jesus pronounced all kinds of food clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>»What comes out of a man,« He added, »that it is which makes him unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of men's hearts, their evil purposes proceed–fornication, theft, murder, adultery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, reviling, pride, reckless folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these wicked things come out from within and make a man unclean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood of Tyre and Sidon. Here He entered a house and wished no one to know it, but He could not escape observation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>She was a Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation: and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>»Let the children first eat all they want,« He said; »it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>»True, Sir,« she replied, »and yet the dogs under the table eat the children's scraps.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>»For those words of yours, go home,« He replied; »the demon has gone out of your daughter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>So she went home, and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing through the district of the Ten Towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on whom they begged Him to lay His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>So Jesus taking him aside, apart from the crowd, put His fingers into his ears, and spat, and moistened his tongue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>and looking up to Heaven He sighed, and said to him, »Ephphatha!« (that is, »Open!«)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And the man's ears were opened, and his tongue became untied, and he began to speak perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>Then Jesus charged them to tell no one; but the more He charged them, all the more did they spread the news far and wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>The amazement was extreme. »He succeeds in everything he attempts,« they exclaimed; »he even makes deaf men hear and dumb men speak!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>About that time there was again an immense crowd, and they found themselves with nothing to eat. So He called His disciples to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>»My heart yearns over the people,« He said; »for this is now the third day they have remained with me, and they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>If I were to send them home hungry, they would faint on the way, some of them having come a great distance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>»Where can we possibly get bread here in this remote place to satisfy such a crowd?« answered His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>»How many loaves have you?« He asked. »Seven,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So He passed the word to the people to sit down on the ground. Then taking the seven loaves He blessed them, and broke them into portions and proceeded to give them to His disciples for them to distribute, and they distributed them to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had also a few small fish. He blessed them, and He told His disciples to distribute these also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So the people ate an abundant meal; and what remained over they picked up and carried away–seven hampers of broken pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>The number fed were about 4,000. Then He sent them away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>and at once going on board with His disciples He came into the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees followed Him and began to dispute with Him, asking Him for a sign in the sky, to make trial of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>Heaving a deep and troubled sigh, He said, »Why do the men of to-day ask for a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign will be given to the men of to-day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>So He left them, went on board again, and came away to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now they had forgotten to take bread, nor had they more than a single loaf with them in the boat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>and when He admonished them, »See to it, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>they explained His words to one another by saying, »We have no bread!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>He perceived what they were saying, and He said to them, »What is this discussion of yours about having no bread? Do you not yet see and understand? Are your minds so dull of comprehension?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>-You have eyes! can you not see? You have ears! can you not hear?- and have you no memory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke up the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets did you carry away full of broken portions? »Twelve,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>»And when the seven for the 4,000, how many hampers full of portions did you take away?« »Seven,« they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>»Do you not yet understand?« He said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And they came to Bethsaida. And a blind man was brought to Jesus and they entreated Him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>So He took the blind man by the arm and brought him out of the village, and spitting into his eyes He put His hands on him and asked him, »Can you see anything?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>He looked up and said, »I can see the people: I see them like trees–only walking.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then for the second time He put His hands on the man's eyes, and the man, looking steadily, recovered his sight and saw everything distinctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>So He sent him home, and added, »Do not even go into the village.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>From that place Jesus and His disciples went to the villages belonging to Caesarea Philippi. On the way He began to ask His disciples, »Who do people say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>»John the Baptist,« they replied, »but others say Elijah, and others, that it is one of the Prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Then He asked them pointedly, »But you yourselves, who do you say that I am?«»You are the Christ,« answered Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And He strictly forbad them to tell this about Him to any one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And now for the first time He told them, »The Son of Man must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and after two days rise to life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>This He told them plainly; whereupon Peter took Him and began to remonstrate with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But turning round and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter. »Get behind me, Adversary,« He said, »for your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but men's.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Then calling to Him the crowd and also His disciples, He said to them, »If any one is desirous of following me, let him ignore self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever is bent on securing his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, will secure it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>Why, what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>For what could a man give to buy back his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>Every one, however, who has been ashamed of me and of my teachings in this faithless and sinful age, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in His Father's glory with the holy angels.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>He went on to say, »In solemn truth I tell you that some of those who are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God already come in power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and brought them alone, apart from the rest, up a high mountain; and in their presence His appearance underwent a change.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His garments also became dazzling with brilliant whiteness–such whiteness as no bleaching on earth could give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Moreover there appeared to them Elijah accompanied by Moses; and the two were conversing with Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>when Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three tents–one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>For he knew not what to say: they were filled with such awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then there came a cloud spreading over them, and a voice issued from the cloud, »This is my Son, dearly loved: listen to Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>Instantly they looked round, and now they could no longer see any one, but themselves and Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>As they were coming down from the mountain, He very strictly forbad them to tell any one what they had seen »until after the Son of Man has risen from among the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>So they kept the matter to themselves, although frequently asking one another what was meant by the rising from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>They also asked Him, »How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>»Elijah,« He replied, »does indeed come first and reforms everything; but how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He will endure much suffering and be held in contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>Yet I tell you that not only has Elijah come, but they have also done to him whatever they chose, as the Scriptures say about him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>As they came to rejoin the disciples, they saw an immense crowd surrounding them and a party of Scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>Immediately the whole multitude on beholding Him were astonished and awe-struck, and yet they ran forward and greeted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>»What is the subject you are discussing?« He asked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>»Rabbi,« answered one of the crowd, »I have brought you my son. He has a dumb spirit in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and wherever it comes upon him, it dashes him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I begged your disciples to expel it, but they had not the power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>»O unbelieving generation!« replied Jesus; »how long must I be with you? how long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>So they brought him to Jesus. And the spirit, when he saw Jesus, immediately threw the youth into convulsions, so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Then Jesus asked the father, »How long has he been like this?«»From early childhood,« he said;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>»and often it has thrown him into the fire or into pools of water to destroy him. But, if you possibly can, have pity on us and help us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>»`If I possibly can!'« replied Jesus; »why, everything is possible to him who believes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Immediately the father cried out, »I do believe: strengthen my weak faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>Then Jesus, seeing that an increasing crowd was running towards Him, rebuked the foul spirit, and said to it, »Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter into him again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>So with a loud cry he threw the boy into fit after fit, and came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, so that most of them said he was dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>but Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>After the return of Jesus to the house His disciples asked Him privately, »How is it that we could not expel the spirit?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>»An evil spirit of this kind,« He answered, »can only be driven out by prayer.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Departing thence they passed through Galilee, and He was unwilling that any one should know it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for He was teaching His disciples, and telling them, »The Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and after being put to death, in three days He will rise to life again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>They, however, did not understand what He meant, and were afraid to question Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>So they came to Capernaum; and when in the house He asked them, »What were you arguing about on the way?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they remained silent; for on the way they had debated with one another who was the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>Then sitting down He called the Twelve, and said to them, »If any one wishes to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And taking a young child He made him stand in their midst, then threw His arms round him and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>»Whoever for my sake receives one such young child as this, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not so much me as Him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>»Rabbi,« said John to Him, »we saw a man making use of your name to expel demons, and we tried to hinder him, on the ground that he did not follow us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>»You should not have tried to hinder him,« replied Jesus, »for there is no one who will use my name to perform a miracle and be able the next minute to speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>He who is not against us is for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>and whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, I solemnly tell you that he will certainly not lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>»And whoever shall occasion the fall of one of these little ones who believe, he would be better off if, with a millstone round his neck, he were lying at the bottom of the sea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand should cause you to sin, cut it off: it would be better for you to enter into Life maimed, than remain in possession of both your hands and go away into Gehenna, into the fire which cannot be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>Or if your foot should cause you to sin, cut it off: it would be better for you to enter into Life crippled, than remain in possession of both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>Or if your eye should cause you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God half-blind than remain in possession of two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where their worm does not die and the fire does not go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>Every one, however, will be salted with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>Salt is a good thing, but if the salt should become tasteless, what will you use to give it saltness? Have salt within you and live at peace with one another.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Soon on His feet once more, He enters the district of Judaea and crosses the Jordan: again the people flock to Him, and ere long, as was usual with Him, He was teaching them once more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>Presently a party of Pharisees come to Him with the question–seeking to entrap Him, »May a man divorce his wife?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>»What rule did Moses lay down for you?« He answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>»Moses,« they said, »permitted a man to draw up a written notice of divorce, and to send his wife away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>»It was in consideration of your stubborn hearts,« said Jesus, »that Moses enacted this law for you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>but from the beginning of the creation the rule was, `Male and female did God make them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.8'>and the two shall be one'; so that they are two no longer, but `one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>What, therefore, God has joined together let not man separate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>Indoors the disciples began questioning Jesus again on the same subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>He replied, »Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman, commits adultery against the first wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>and if a woman puts away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>One day people were bringing young children to Jesus for Him to touch them, but the disciples interfered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>Jesus, however, on seeing this, was moved to indignation, and said to them, »Let the little children come to me: do not hinder them; for to those who are childlike the Kingdom of God belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>In solemn truth I tell you that no one who does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will by any possibility enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>Then He took them in His arms and blessed them lovingly, one by one, laying His hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>As He went out to resume His journey, there came a man running up to Him, who knelt at His feet and asked, »Good Rabbi, what am I to do in order to inherit the Life of the Ages?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>»Why do you call me good?« asked Jesus in reply; »there is no one truly good except One–that is, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the Commandments–`Do not murder;' `Do not commit adultery;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;' `Do not defraud;' `Honour thy father and thy mother.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>»Rabbi,« he replied, »all these Commandments I have carefully obeyed from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Then Jesus looked at him and loved him, and said, »One thing is lacking in you: go, sell all you possess and give the proceeds to the poor, and you shall have riches in Heaven; and come and be a follower of mine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>At these words his brow darkened, and he went away sad; for he was possessed of great wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then looking round on His disciples Jesus said, »With how hard a struggle will the possessors of riches enter the Kingdom of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were amazed at His words. Jesus, however, said again, »Children, how hard a struggle is it for those who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>They were astonished beyond measure, and said to one another, »Who then can be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looking on them said, »With men it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>»Remember,« said Peter to Him, »that we forsook everything and have become your followers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.29'>»In solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that there is no one who has forsaken house or brothers or sisters, or mother or father, or children or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.30'>but will receive a hundred times as much now in this present life –houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands– and persecution with them–and in the coming age the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.31'>But many who are now first will be last, and the last, first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; they were full of wonder, and some, though they followed, did so with fear. Then, once more calling to Him the Twelve, He began to tell them what was about to happen to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>»See,« He said, »we are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and the Scribes. They will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over to the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.34'>they will insult Him in cruel sport, spit on Him, scourge Him, and put Him to death; but on the third day He will rise to life again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>Then James and John, the sons of Zabdi, came up to Him and said, »Rabbi, we wish you would grant us whatever request we make of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>»What would you have me do for you?« He asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>»Allow us,« they replied, »to sit one at your right hand and the other at your left hand, in your glory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>»You know not,« said He, »what you are asking. Are you able to drink out of the cup from which I am to drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>»We are able,« they replied. »Out of the cup,« said Jesus, »from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not mine to give: it will be for those for whom it is reserved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>The other ten, hearing of it, were at first highly indignant with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>Jesus, however, called them to Him and said to them, »You are aware how those who are deemed rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men make them feel their authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>but it is not to be so among you. No, whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>and whoever desires to be first among you must be the bondservant of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>For the Son of Man also did not come to be waited upon, but to wait on others, and to give His life as the redemption-price for a multitude of people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>They came to Jericho; and as He was leaving that town –Himself and His disciples and a great crowd– Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the way-side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, »Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.48'>Many angrily told him to leave off shouting; but he only cried out all the louder, »Son of David, have pity on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.49'>Then Jesus stood still. »Call him,« He said. So they called the blind man. »Cheer up,« they said; »rise, he is calling you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>The man flung away his outer garment, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>»What shall I do for you?« said Jesus. »Rabboni,« replied the blind man, »let me recover my sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.52'>»Go,« said Jesus, »your faith has cured you.« Instantly he regained his sight, and followed Him along the road.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.11'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.1'>When they were getting near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on in front, with these instructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.2'>»Go,« He said, »to the village facing you, and immediately on entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie him and bring him here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.3'>And if any one asks you, `Why are you doing that?' say, `The Master needs it, and will send it back here without delay.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.4'>So they went and found a young ass tied up at the front door of a house. They were untying it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.5'>when some of the bystanders called out, »What are you doing, untying the foal?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>But on their giving the answer that Jesus had bidden them give, they let them take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>So they brought the foal to Jesus, and threw their outer garments over him; and Jesus mounted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.8'>Then many spread their outer garments to carpet the road, and others leafy branches which they had cut down in the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.9'>while those who led the way and those who followed kept shouting »God save Him!« Blessed be He who comes in the Lord's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.10'>Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our forefather David! God in the highest Heavens save Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>So He came into Jerusalem and into the Temple; and after looking round upon everything there, the hour being now late He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.12'>The next day, after they had left Bethany, He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>But in the distance He saw a fig-tree in full leaf, and went to see whether perhaps He could find some figs on it. When however He came to it, He found nothing but leaves (for it was not fig time);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.14'>and He said to the tree, »Let no one ever again eat fruit from thee!« And His disciples heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>They reached Jerusalem, and entering the Temple He began to drive out the buyers and sellers, and upset the money-changers' tables and the stools of the pigeon-dealers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>And He remonstrated with them. »Is it not written,« He said, »`My House shall be called The House of Prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it what it now is–a robbers' cave.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>This the High Priests and Scribes heard, and they began to devise means to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, because of the deep impression produced on all the people by His teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.19'>When evening came on, Jesus and His disciples used to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>In the early morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree withered to the roots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>and Peter, recollecting, said to Him, »Look, Rabbi, the fig-tree which you cursed is withered up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>Jesus said to them, »Have faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.23'>In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain, `Remove, and hurl thyself into the sea,' and has no doubt about it in his heart, but stedfastly believes that what he says will happen, it shall be granted him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.28'>and asked, »By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you authority to do them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.29'>»And I will put a question to you,« replied Jesus; »answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.30'>John's Baptism–was it of Heavenly or of human origin? Answer me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>So they debated the matter with one another. »Suppose we say, `Heavenly,'« they argued, »he will ask, `Why then did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>Or should we say, `human?'« They were afraid of the people; for all agreed in holding John to have been really a Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.«»Nor do I tell you,« said Jesus, »by what authority I do these things.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Then He began to speak to them in figurative language. »There was once a man,« He said, »who planted a vineyard, fenced it round, dug a pit for the wine-tank, and built a strong lodge. Then he let the place to vine-dressers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>At vintage-time he sent one of his servants to receive from the vine-dressers a share of the grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>But they seized him, beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Again he sent to them another servant: and as for him, they wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>Yet a third he sent, and him they killed. And he sent many besides, and them also they ill-treated, beating some and killing others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He had still one left whom he could send, a dearly-loved son: him last of all he sent, saying, »`They will treat my son with respect.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>»But those men –the vine-dressers– said to one another,« `Here is the heir: come, let us kill him, and then the property will one day be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>»So they took him and killed him, and flung his body outside the vineyard.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do?« »He will come and put the vine-dressers to death,« they said; »and will give the vineyard to others.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>»Have you not read even this passage,« He added, »`The stone which the builders rejected has become the Cornerstone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our esteem?'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they kept looking out for an opportunity to seize Him, but were afraid of the people; for they saw that in this parable He had referred to them. So they left Him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Their next step was to send to Him some of the Pharisees and of Herod's partisans to entrap Him in conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>So they came to Him. »Rabbi,« they said, »we know that you are a truthful man and you do not fear any one; for you do not recognize human distinctions, but teach God's way truly. Is it allowable to pay poll-tax to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we pay, or shall we refuse to pay?« But He, knowing their hypocrisy, replied, »Why try to ensnare me? Bring me a shilling for me to look at.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>They brought one; and He asked them, »Whose is this likeness and this inscription?«»Caesar's,« they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>»What is Caesar's,« replied Jesus, »pay to Caesar–and what is God's, pay to God.« And they wondered exceedingly at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then came to Him a party of Sadducees, a sect which denies that there is any Resurrection; and they proceeded to question Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>»Rabbi,« they said, »Moses made it a law for us: `If a man's brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife, but at his death left no family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>The second married her, and died, leaving no family; and the third did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And so did the rest of the seven, all dying childless. Finally the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>At the Resurrection whose wife will she be? For they all seven married her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>»Is not this the cause of your error,« replied Jesus– your ignorance alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they have risen from among the dead, men do not marry and women are not given in marriage, but they are as angels are in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But as to the dead, that they rise to life, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God said to him, `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of dead, but of living men. You are in grave error.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point, and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, »Which is the chief of all the Commandments?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>»The chief Commandment,« replied Jesus, »is this: `Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this: `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as thou lovest thyself.' »Other Commandment greater than these there is none.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>So the Scribe said to Him, »Rightly, in very truth, Rabbi, have you said that He stands alone, and there is none but He;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and To love Him with all one's heart, with all one's understanding, and with all one's strength, and to love one's fellow man no less than oneself, is far better than all our whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said to him, »You are not far from the Kingdom of God.« No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, »How is it the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I have made thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>»David himself calls Him `Lord:' how then can He be his son?« And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>Moreover in the course of His teaching He said, »Be on your guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues and at dinner parties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their wickedness by making long prayers: these men will receive far heavier punishment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed how the people were dropping money into the Treasury, and that many of the wealthy threw in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>But there came one poor widow and dropped in two farthings, equal in value to a halfpenny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>So He called His disciples to Him and said, »In solemn truth I tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more than all the other contributors to the Treasury;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>for they have all contributed out of what they could well spare, but she out of her need has thrown in all she possessed–all she had to live on.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed, »Look, Rabbi, what wonderful stones! what wonderful buildings!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>»You see all these great buildings?« Jesus replied; »not one stone will be left here upon another–not thrown down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple, when Peter, James, John, and Andrew, apart from the others asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>»Tell us, When will these things be? and what will be the sign when all these predictions are on the point of being fulfilled?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>So Jesus began to say to them: »Take care that no one misleads you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>Many will come assuming my name and saying, `I am He;' and they will mislead many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed: come they must, but the End is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>For nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>»You yourselves must be on your guard. They will deliver you up to Sanhedrins; you will be brought into synagogues and cruelly beaten; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to be witnesses to them for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>But the proclamation of the Good News must be carried to all the Gentiles before the End comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>When however they are marching you along under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say, but speak what is given you when the time comes; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>»Brother will betray brother to be killed, and fathers will betray children; and children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>You will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name, but those who stand firm to the End will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>»As soon, however, as you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not« –let the reader observe these words– then let those in Judaea escape to the hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.15'>let him who is on the roof not come down and enter the house to fetch anything out of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.16'>and let not him who is in the field turn back to pick up his outer garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.17'>And alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.18'>»But pray that it may not come in the winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.19'>For those will be times of suffering the like of which has never been from the first creation of God's world until now, and assuredly never will be again;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.20'>and but for the fact that the Lord has cut short those days, no one would escape; but for the sake of His own People whom He has chosen for Himself He has cut short the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.21'>»At that time if any one says to you, `See, here is the Christ!' or `See, He is there!' do not believe it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.22'>For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying signs and prodigies with a view to lead astray –if indeed that were possible– even God's own People.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.23'>But as for yourselves, be on your guard: I have forewarned you of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.24'>»At that time, however, after that distress, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.25'>the stars will be seen falling from the firmament, and the forces which are in the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.26'>And then will they see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.27'>Then He will send forth the angels and gather together His chosen People from north, south, east and west, from the remotest parts of the earth and the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.28'>»Learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branch has become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.29'>So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure that He is near, at your very door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.30'>I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.31'>Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.32'>»But as to that day or the exact time no one knows–not even the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.33'>Take care, be on the alert, and pray; for you do not know when it will happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.34'>It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given the management to his servants –to each one his special duty– and has ordered the porter to keep awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.35'>Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of the house is coming–in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow, or at dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.36'>Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.37'>Moreover, what I say to you I say to all–Be wakeful!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.14'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the High Priests and Scribes were bent on finding how to seize Him by stratagem and put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>But they said, »Not on the Festival-day, for fear there should be a riot among the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>Now when He was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while He was at table, there came a woman with a jar of pure, sweet-scented ointment very costly: she broke the jar and poured the ointment over His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>But there were some who said indignantly among themselves, »Why has the ointment been thus wasted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For that ointment might have been sold for fifteen pounds or more, and the money have been given to the poor.« And they were exceedingly angry with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, »Leave her alone: why are you troubling her? She has done a most gracious act towards me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you choose you can do acts of kindness to them; but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>What she could she did: she has perfumed my body in preparation for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>And I solemnly tell you that wherever in the whole world the Good News shall be proclaimed, this which she has done shall also be told in remembrance of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>But Judas Iscariot, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, went to the High Priests to betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>They gladly listened to his proposal, and promised to give him a sum of money. So he looked out for an opportunity to betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread –the day for killing the Passover lamb– His disciples asked Him, »Where shall we go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>So He sent two of His disciples with instructions, saying, »Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>and whatever house he enters, tell the master of the house, `The Rabbi asks, Where is my room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.15'>Then he will himself show you a large room upstairs, ready furnished: there make preparation for us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.16'>So the disciples went out and came to the city, and found everything just as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.17'>When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>And while they were at table Jesus said, »I solemnly tell you that one of you will betray me–one who is eating with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>They were filled with sorrow, and began asking Him, one by one, »Not I, is it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>»It is one of the Twelve,« He replied; »he who is dipping his fingers in the dish with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>For the Son of Man is going His way as it is written about Him; but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man, had he never been born.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>Also during the meal He took a Passover biscuit, blessed it, and broke it. He then gave it to them, saying, »Take this, it is my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and handed it to them, and they all of them drank from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.24'>»This is my blood,« He said, »which is to be poured out on behalf of many–the blood which makes the Covenant sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.25'>I solemnly tell you that never again will I taste the produce of the vine till I shall drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.26'>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>Then said Jesus to them, »All of you are about to stumble and fall, for it is written, `I will strike down the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered in all directions.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.29'>»All may stumble and fall,« said Peter, »yet I never will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>»I solemnly tell you,« replied Jesus, »that to-day –this night– before the cock crows twice, you yourself will three times disown me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>»Even if I must die with you,« declared Peter again and again, »I will never disown you.« In like manner protested also all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>So they came to a place called Gethsemane. There He said to His disciples, »Sit down here till I have prayed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be full of terror and distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>and He said to them, »My heart is oppressed with anguish to the very point of death: wait here and keep awake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>Going forward a short distance He threw Himself upon His face and prayed repeatedly that, if it was possible, He might be spared that time of agony;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>and He said, »Abba! my Father! all things are possible for Thee: take this cup of suffering away from me: and yet not what I desire, but what Thou desirest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Then He came and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, »Simon, are you asleep? Had you not strength to keep awake a single hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>Be wakeful, all of you, and keep on praying, that you may not come into temptation: the spirit is right willing, but the body is frail.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>He again went away and prayed, using the very same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>When He returned He again found them asleep, for they were very tired; and they knew not how to answer Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>A third time He came, and then He said, »Sleep on and rest. Enough! the hour has come. Even now they are betraying the Son of Man into the hands of sinful men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Rouse yourselves, let us be going: my betrayer is close at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came and with him a crowd of men armed with swords and cudgels, sent by the High Priests and Scribes and Elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. »The one I kiss,« he said, »is the man: lay hold of him, and take him safely away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>So he came, and going straight to Jesus he said, »Rabbi!« and kissed Him with seeming affection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>whereupon they laid hands on Him and held Him firmly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck a blow at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>»Have you come out,« said Jesus, »with swords and cudgels to arrest me, as if you had to fight with a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>Day after day I used to be among you in the Temple teaching, and you never seized me. But this is happening in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then His friends all forsook Him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>One youth indeed did follow Him, wearing only a linen cloth round his bare body. Of him they laid hold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>but he left the linen cloth in their hands and fled without it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>So they led Jesus away to the High Priest, and with him there assembled all the High Priests, Elders, and Scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the outer court of the High Priest's palace. But there he remained sitting among the officers, and warming himself by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Meanwhile the High Priests and the entire Sanhedrin were endeavouring to get evidence against Jesus in order to put Him to death, but could find none;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>for though many gave false testimony against Him, their statements did not tally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Then some came forward as witnesses and falsely declared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>»We have heard him say, `I will pull down this Sanctuary built by human hands, and three days afterwards I will erect another built without hands.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But not even in this shape was their testimony consistent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>At last the High Priest stood up, and advancing into the midst of them all, asked Jesus, »Have you no answer to make? What is the meaning of all this that these witnesses allege against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But He remained silent, and gave no reply. A second time the High Priest questioned Him. »Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>»I am,« replied Jesus, »and you and others will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the divine Power, and coming amid the clouds of the sky.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Rending his garments the High Priest exclaimed, »What need have we of witnesses after that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You all heard his impious words. What is your judgement?« Then with one voice they condemned Him as deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Thereupon some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, while striking Him with their fists and crying, »Prove that you are a prophet.« The officers too struck Him with open hands as they took Him in charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now while Peter was below in the quadrangle, one of the High Priest's maidservants came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, »You also were with Jesus, the Nazarene.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, and said, »I don't know –I don't understand– What do you mean?« And then he went out into the outer court. Just then a cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>Again the maidservant saw him, and again began to say to the people standing by, »He is one of them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>A second time he repeatedly denied it. Soon afterwards the bystanders again accused Peter, saying, »You are surely one of them, for you too are a Galilaean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he broke out into curses and oaths, declaring, »I know nothing of the man you are talking about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed for the second time, and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, »Before the cock crows twice, you will three times disown me.« And as he thought of it, he wept aloud.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>At earliest dawn, after the High Priests had held a consultation with the Elders and Scribes, they and the entire Sanhedrin bound Jesus and took Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>So Pilate questioned Him. »Are you the King of the Jews?« he asked. »I am,« replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>Then, as the High Priests went on heaping accusations on Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Pilate again and again asked Him, »Do you make no reply? Listen to the many charges they are bringing against you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus made no further answer: so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the Festival it was customary for Pilate to release to the Jews any one prisoner whom they might beg off from punishment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>and at this time a man named Barabbas was in prison among the insurgents–persons who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>So the people came crowding up, asking Pilate to grant them the usual favour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>»Shall I release for you the King of the Jews?« answered Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he could see that it was out of sheer spite that the High Priests had handed Him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the High Priests urged on the crowd to obtain Barabbas's release in preference;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>and when Pilate again asked them, »What then shall I do to the man you call King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>they once more shouted out, »Crucify Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>»Why, what crime has he committed?« asked Pilate. But they vehemently shouted, »Crucify Him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the mob, released Barabbas for them, and after scourging Jesus handed Him over for crucifixion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>Then the soldiers led Him away into the court of the Palace (the Praetorium), and calling together the whole battalion</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>they arrayed Him in crimson, placed on His head a wreath of thorny twigs which they had twisted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and went on to salute Him with shouts of »Long live the King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>Then they began to beat Him on the head with a cane, to spit on Him, and to do Him homage on bended knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>At last, having finished their sport, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>One Simon, a Cyrenaean, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing along, coming from the country: him they compelled to carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>So they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which, being translated, means `Skull-ground.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>Here they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He refused it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>Then they crucified Him. This done, they divided His garments among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>Over His head was the notice in writing of the charge against Him: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And together with Jesus they crucified two robbers, one at His right hand and one at His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And all the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him and said, »Ah! you who were for destroying the Sanctuary and building a new one in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>come down from the cross and save yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way the High Priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on scoffing at Him, saying to one another, »He has saved others: himself he cannot save!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>This Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Even the men who were being crucified with Him heaped insults on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>At noon there came a darkness over the whole land, lasting till three o'clock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>But at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Elohi, Elohi, lama sabachthani?« which means, »My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some of the bystanders, hearing Him, said, »Listen, he is calling for Elijah!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>Then a man ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, and he put it on the end of a cane and placed it to His lips, saying at the same time, »Wait! let us see whether Elijah will come and take him down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But Jesus uttered a loud cry and yielded up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the curtain in the Sanctuary was torn in two, from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the Centurion who stood in front of the cross saw that He was dead, he exclaimed, »This man was indeed God's Son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also a party of women looking on from a distance; among them being both Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joses, and Salome–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>all of whom in the Galilaean days had habitually been with Him and cared for Him, as well as many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>Towards sunset, as it was the Preparation –that is, the day preceding the Sabbath–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea came, a highly respected member of the Council, who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God. He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead. He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether He had been long dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>and having ascertained the fact he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock; after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was put.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, in order to come and anoint His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>So, very soon after sunrise on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>and they were saying to one another, `Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>But then, looking up, they saw that the stone was already rolled back: for it was of immense size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>Upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at their right hand, clothed in a long white robe. They were astonished and terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, »Do not be terrified. It is Jesus you are looking for–the Nazarene who has been crucified. He has come back to life: He is not here: this is the place where they laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go and tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee: and that there you will see Him, as He told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>So they came out, and fled from the tomb, for they were greatly agitated and surprised; and they said not a word to any one, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>[But He rose to life early on the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary of Magdala from whom He had expelled seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and brought the tidings to those who had been with Him, as they were mourning and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>But they, when they were told that He was alive and that she had seen Him, could not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>Afterwards He showed Himself in another form to two of them as they were walking, on their way into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>These, again, went and told the news to the rest; but not even them did they believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had seen Him alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>Then He said to them, »Go the whole world over, and proclaim the Good News to all mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these. By making use of my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak new languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They shall take up venomous snakes, and if they drink any deadly poison it shall do them no harm whatever. They shall lay their hands on the sick, and the sick shall recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So the Lord Jesus after having thus spoken to them was taken up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>But they went out and made proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming their Message by the signs which accompanied it.]</verse>
