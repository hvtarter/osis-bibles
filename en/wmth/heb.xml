  <div osisID='Heb' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who in ancient days spoke to our forefathers in many distinct messages and by various methods through the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has at the end of these days spoken to us through a Son, who is the pre-destined Lord of the universe, and through whom He made the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>He brightly reflects God's glory and is the exact representation of His being, and upholds the universe by His all-powerful word. After securing man's purification from sin He took His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become as far superior to the angels as the Name He possesses by inheritance is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did God ever say, »My Son art Thou: I have this day become Thy Father;« and again, »I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be My Son«?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>But speaking of the time when He once more brings His Firstborn into the world, He says, »And let all God's angels worship Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Moreover of the angels He says, »He changes His angels into winds, and His ministering servants into a flame of fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But of His Son, He says, »Thy throne, O God, is for ever and for ever, and the sceptre of Thy Kingdom is a sceptre of absolute justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee with the oil of gladness beyond Thy companions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>It is also of His Son that God says, »Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>The heavens will perish, but Thou remainest; and they will all grow old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and, as though they were a mantle Thou wilt roll them up; yes, like a garment, and they will undergo change. But Thou art the same, and Thy years will never come to an end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which of the angels has He ever said, »Sit at My right hand till I make Thy foes a footstool for Thy feet«?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are not all angels spirits that serve Him–whom He sends out to render service for the benefit of those who, before long, will inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>For this reason we ought to pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, for fear we should drift away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the message delivered through angels proved to be true, and every transgression and act of disobedience met with just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we are indifferent to a salvation as great as that now offered to us? This, after having first of all been announced by the Lord Himself, had its truth made sure to us by those who heard Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God corroborated their testimony by signs and marvels and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed in accordance with His own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>It is not to angels that God has assigned the sovereignty of that coming world, of which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But, as we know, a writer has solemnly said, How poor a creature is man, and yet Thou dost remember him, and a son of man, and yet Thou dost come to him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him only a little inferior to the angels; with glory and honour Thou hast crowned him, and hast set him to govern the works of Thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>Thou hast put everything in subjection under his feet. - For this subjecting of the universe to man implies the leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not as yet see the universe subject to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But Jesus –who was made a little inferior to the angels in order that through God's grace He might taste death for every human being– we already see wearing a crown of glory and honour because of His having suffered death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting that He for whom, and through whom, all things exist, after He had brought many sons to glory, should perfect by suffering the Prince Leader who had saved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both He who sanctifies and those whom He is sanctifying have all one Father; and for this reason He is not ashamed to speak of them as His brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>as when He says: »I will proclaim Thy name to My brothers: in the midst of the congregation I will hymn Thy praises;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>and again, »As for Me, I will be one whose trust reposes in God;« and again, »Here am I, and here are the children God has given Me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since then the children referred to are all alike sharers in perishable human nature, He Himself also, in the same way, took on Him a share of it, in order that through death He might render powerless him who had authority over death, that is, the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might set at liberty all those who through fear of death had been subject to lifelong slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For assuredly it is not to angels that He is continually reaching a helping hand, but it is to the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>And for this purpose it was necessary that in all respects He should be made to resemble His brothers, so that He might become a compassionate and faithful High Priest in things relating to God, in order to atone for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For inasmuch as He has Himself felt the pain of temptation and trial, He is also able instantly to help those who are tempted and tried.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brethren, sharers with others in a heavenly invitation, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whose followers we profess to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>How faithful He was to Him who appointed Him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, in so far as he who has built a house has higher honour than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house has had a builder, and the builder of all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Moreover, Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant in delivering the message given him to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ was faithful as a Son having authority over God's house, and we are that house, if we hold firm to the End the boldness and the hope which we boast of as ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>For this reason–as the Holy Spirit warns us, »To-day, if you hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation on the day of the temptation in the Desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, `They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest« –</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>see to it, brethren, that there is never in any one of you –as perhaps there may be– a sinful and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in revolt from the ever-living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>On the contrary encourage one another, day after day, so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through the deceitful character of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>seeing that the warning still comes to us, »To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For who were they that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the Desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore let us be on our guard lest perhaps, while He still leaves us a promise of being admitted to His rest, some one of you should be found to have fallen short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For Good News has been brought to us as truly as to them; but the message they heard failed to benefit them, because they were not one in faith with those who gave heed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>We who have believed are soon to be admitted to the true rest; as He has said, »As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest,« although God's works had been going on ever since the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For, as we know, when speaking of the seventh day He has used the words, »And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and He has also declared, »They shall not be admitted to My rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since, then, it is still true that some will be admitted to that rest, and that because of disobedience those who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them were not admitted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>He again definitely mentions a certain day, »To-day,« saying long afterwards, by David's lips, in the words already quoted, »To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them the true rest, we should not afterwards hear God speaking of another still future day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>It follows that there still remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For He who has been admitted to His rest, has rested from His works as God did from His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let it then be our earnest endeavour to be admitted to that rest, so that no one may perish through following the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For God's Message is full of life and power, and is keener than the sharpest two-edged sword. It pierces even to the severance of soul from spirit, and penetrates between the joints and the marrow, and it can discern the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny; but everything lies bare and completely exposed before the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Inasmuch, then, as we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed into Heaven itself, let us hold firmly to our profession of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a High Priest who is unable to feel for us in our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in every respect just as we are tempted, and yet did not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our times of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every High Priest is chosen from among men, and is appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to God, in order to offer both gifts and sin-offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>and must be one who is able to bear patiently with the ignorant and erring, because he himself also is beset with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And for this reason he is required to offer sin-offerings not only for the people but also for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no one takes this honourable office upon himself, but only accepts it when called to it by God, as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So Christ also did not claim for Himself the honour of being made High Priest, but was appointed to it by Him who said to Him, »My Son art Thou: I have to-day become Thy Father;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as also in another passage He says, »Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>For Jesus during his earthly life offered up prayers and entreaties, crying aloud and weeping as He pleaded with Him who was able to bring Him in safety out of death, and He was delivered from the terror from which He shrank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although He was God's Son, yet He learned obedience from the sufferings which He endured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and so, having been made perfect, He became to all who obey Him the source and giver of eternal salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>For God Himself addresses Him as a High Priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning Him we have much to say, and much that it would be difficult to make clear to you, since you have become so dull of apprehension.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For although, considering the long time you have been believers, you ought now to be teachers of others, you really need some one to teach you over again the very rudiments of the truths of God, and you have come to require milk instead of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>By people who live on milk I mean those who are imperfectly acquainted with the teaching concerning righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>Such persons are mere babes. But solid food is for adults–that is, for those who through constant practice have their spiritual faculties carefully trained to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore leaving elementary instruction about the Christ, let us advance to mature manhood and not be continually re-laying a foundation of repentance from lifeless works and of faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>or of teaching about ceremonial washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the last judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And advance we will, if God permits us to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once for all been enlightened, and have tasted the sweetness of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have realized how good the word of God is and how mighty are the powers of the coming Age, and then fell away–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>it is impossible, I say, to keep bringing them back to a new repentance, for, to their own undoing, they are repeatedly crucifying the Son of God afresh and exposing Him to open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For land which has drunk in the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sakes, indeed, it is tilled, has a share in God's blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But if it only yields a mass of thorns and briers, it is considered worthless, and is in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be destroyed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we, even while we speak in this tone, have a happier conviction concerning you, my dearly-loved friends–a conviction of things which point towards salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust so that He is unmindful of your labour and of the love which you have manifested towards Himself in having rendered services to His people and in still rendering them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we long for each of you to continue to manifest the same earnestness, with a view to your enjoying fulness of hope to the very End;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>so that you may not become half-hearted, but be imitators of those who through faith and patient endurance are now heirs to the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God gave the promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, »Assuredly I will bless you and bless you, I will increase you and increase you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, as the result of patient waiting, our forefather obtained what God had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men swear by what is greater than themselves; and with them an oath in confirmation of a statement always puts an end to a dispute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In the same way, since it was God's desire to display more convincingly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable His purpose was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>He added an oath, in order that, through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for Him to prove false, we may possess mighty encouragement–we who, for safety, have hastened to lay hold of the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>That hope we have as an anchor of the soul–an anchor that can neither break nor drag. It passes in behind the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become, like Melchizedek, a High Priest for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this man, Melchizedek, King of Salem and priest of the Most High God –he who when Abraham was returning after defeating the kings met him and pronounced a blessing on him–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham presented a tenth part of all–being first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and secondly King of Salem, that is, King of peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>with no father or mother, and no record of ancestry: having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made a type of the Son of God–this man Melchizedek remains a priest for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now think how great this priest-king must have been to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth part of the best of the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And those of the descendants of Levi who receive the priesthood are authorized by the Law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these have sprung from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But, in this instance, one who does not trace his origin from them takes tithes from Abraham, and pronounces a blessing on him to whom the promises belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And beyond all dispute it is always the inferior who is blessed by the superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Moreover here frail mortal men receive tithes: there one receives them about whom there is evidence that he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And Levi too –if I may so speak– pays tithes through Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for Levi was yet in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Now if the crowning blessing was attainable by means of the Levitical priesthood –for as resting on this foundation the people received the Law, to which they are still subject– what further need was there for a Priest of a different kind to be raised up belonging to the order of Melchizedek instead of being said to belong to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when the priesthood changes, a change of Law also of necessity takes place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>He, however, to whom that prophecy refers is associated with a different tribe, not one member of which has anything to do with the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is undeniable that our Lord sprang from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing in connection with priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And this is still more abundantly clear when we read that it is as belonging to the order of Melchizedek that a priest of a different kind is to arise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>and hold His office not in obedience to any temporary Law, but by virtue of an indestructible Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For the words are in evidence, »Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>On the one hand we have here the abrogation of an earlier code because it was weak and ineffective–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>for the Law brought no perfect blessing–but on the other hand we have the bringing in of a new and better hope by means of which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And since it was not without an oath being taken–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>for these men hold office without any oath having been taken, but He holds it attested by an oath from Him who said to Him, »The Lord has sworn and will not recall His words, Thou art a Priest for ever« –</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>so much the more also is the Covenant of which Jesus has become the guarantor, a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they have been appointed priests many in number, because death prevents their continuance in office:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but He, because He continues for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass to any successor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Hence too He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, seeing that He ever lives to plead for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>Moreover we needed just such a High Priest as this–holy, guileless, undefiled, far removed from sinful men and exalted above the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who, unlike other High Priests, is not under the necessity of offering up sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and afterwards for those of the people; for this latter thing He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the Law constitutes men High Priests –men with all their infirmity– but the utterance of the oath, which came later than the Law, constitutes High Priest a Son who has been made for ever perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now in connexion with what we have been saying the chief point is that we have a High Priest who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of God's Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>and ministers in the Holy place and in the true tabernacle which not man, but the Lord pitched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>Every High Priest, however, is appointed to offer both bloodless gifts and sacrifices. Therefore this High Priest also must have some offering to present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If then He were still on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since here there are already those who present the offerings in obedience to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things, just as Moses was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle. For God said, »See that you make everything in imitation of the pattern shown you on the mountain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But, as a matter of fact, the ministry which Christ has obtained is all the nobler a ministry, in that He is at the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant, based upon sublimer promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first Covenant had been free from imperfection, there would have been no attempt to introduce another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For, being dissatisfied with His people, God says, »`There are days coming,' says the Lord, `When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new Covenant–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>a Covenant unlike the one which I made with their forefathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they would not remain faithful to that.' `So I turned from them,' says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>`But this is the Covenant that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days,' says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts. And I will indeed be their God and they shall be My People.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord. For all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>Because I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and their sins I will remember no longer.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>By using the words, »a new Covenant,« He has made the first one obsolete; but whatever is decaying and showing signs of old age is not far from disappearing altogether.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first Covenant had regulations for divine worship, and had also its sanctuary–a sanctuary belonging to this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a sacred tent was constructed–the outer one, in which were the lamp and the table and the presented loaves; and this is called the Holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And behind the second veil was a sacred tent called the Holy of holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>This had a censer of gold, and the ark of the Covenant lined with gold and completely covered with gold, and in it were a gold vase which held the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded and the tables of the Covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And above the ark were the Cherubim denoting God's glorious presence and overshadowing the Mercy-seat. But I cannot now speak about all these in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>These arrangements having long been completed, the priests, when conducting the divine services, continually enter the outer tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second, the High Priest goes only on one day of the year, and goes alone, taking with him blood, which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins which the people have ignorantly committed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>And the lesson which the Holy Spirit teaches is this–that the way into the true Holy place is not yet open so long as the outer tent still remains in existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>And this is a figure –for the time now present– answering to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, unable though they are to give complete freedom from sin to him who ministers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>For their efficacy depends only on meats and drinks and various washings, ceremonies pertaining to the body and imposed until a time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ appeared as a High Priest of the blessings that are soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect Tent of worship, a tent which has not been built with hands –that is to say does not belong to this material creation–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>and once for all entered the Holy place, taking with Him not the blood of goats and calves, but His own blood, and thus procuring eternal redemption for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them holy so as to bring about ceremonial purity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more certainly shall the blood of Christ, who strengthened by the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God, free from blemish, purify your consciences from lifeless works for you to serve the ever-living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this He is the negotiator of a new Covenant, in order that, since a life has been given in atonement for the offences committed under the first Covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance which has been promised to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a legal `will,' there must also be a death brought forward in evidence–the death of him who made it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>And a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person, being never of any avail so long as he who made it lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Accordingly we find that the first Covenant was not inaugurated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when Moses had proclaimed to all the people every commandment contained in the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats and with them water, scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, »This is the blood which confirms the Covenant that God has made binding upon you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And in the same way he also sprinkled blood upon the Tent of worship and upon all the vessels used in the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the Law everything is sprinkled with blood, and that apart from the outpouring of blood there is no remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was needful therefore that the copies of the things in Heaven should be cleansed in this way, but that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with more costly sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For not into a Holy place built by men's hands –a mere copy of the reality– did Christ enter, but He entered Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor did He enter for the purpose of many times offering Himself in sacrifice, just as the High Priest enters the Holy place, year after year, taking with him blood not his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>In that case Christ would have needed to suffer many times, from the creation of the world onwards; but as a matter of fact He has appeared once for all, at the Close of the Ages, in order to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And since it is reserved for all mankind once to die, and afterwards to be judged;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so the Christ also, having been once offered in sacrifice in order that He might bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, separated from sin, to those who are eagerly expecting Him, to make their salvation complete.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For, since the Law exhibits only an outline of the blessings to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves, the priests can never, by repeating the same sacrifices which they continually offer year after year, give complete freedom from sin to those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the consciences of the worshippers –who in that case would now have been cleansed once for all– would no longer be burdened with sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those sacrifices sins are recalled to memory year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>That is why, when He comes into the world, He says, »Sacrifice and offering Thou has not desired, but a body Thou hast prepared for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In whole burnt-offerings and in sin-offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, `I have come –in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me– to do Thy will, O God.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>After saying the words I have just quoted, »Sacrifices and offerings or whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings Thou hast not desired or taken pleasure in« –all such being offered in obedience to the Law–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>He then adds, »I have come to do Thy will.« He does away with the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>It is through that divine will that we have been set free from sin, through the offering of Jesus Christ as our sacrifice once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And while every priest stands ministering, day after day, and constantly offering the same sacrifices –though such can never rid us of our sins–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>this Priest, on the contrary, after offering for sins a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy, took His seat at God's right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>waiting from that time onward until His enemies be put as a footstool under His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by a single offering He has for ever completed the blessing for those whom He is setting free from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also gives us His testimony; for when He had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>»`This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord: `I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>He adds, »And their sins and offences I will remember no longer.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Since then, brethren, we have free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the new and ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil –that is to say, of His earthly nature–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from consciences oppressed with sin, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope, for He is faithful who gave us the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing one another to brotherly love and right conduct;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not neglecting –as some habitually do– to meet together, but encouraging one another, and doing this all the more since you can see the day of Christ approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains in reserve any other sacrifice for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>There remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement, and the fury of a fire which before long will devour the enemies of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Any one who bids defiance to the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much severer punishment, think you, will he be held to deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, has not regarded as holy that Covenant-blood with which he was set free from sin, and has insulted the Spirit from whom comes grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know who it is that has said, »Vengeance belongs to Me: I will pay back;« and again, »The Lord will be His people's judge.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the ever-living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But continually recall to mind the days now past, when on being first enlightened you went through a great conflict and many sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings of those who were thus treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned, but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken from you, being well aware that you have in your own selves a more valuable possession and one which will remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not cast from you your confident hope, for it will receive a vast reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For there is still but a short time and then »The coming One will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not people who shrink back and perish, but are among those who believe and gain possession of their souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is a well-grounded assurance of that for which we hope, and a conviction of the reality of things which we do not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the saints of old won God's approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>Through faith we understand that the worlds came into being, and still exist, at the command of God, so that what is seen does not owe its existence to that which is visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>Through faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain did, and through this faith he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God giving the testimony by accepting his gifts; and through it, though he is dead, he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>Through faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he could not be found, because God had taken him; for before he was taken we have evidence that he truly pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But where there is no faith it is impossible truly to please Him; for the man who draws near to God must believe that there is a God and that He proves Himself a rewarder of those who earnestly try to find Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>Through faith Noah, being divinely taught about things as yet unseen, reverently gave heed and built an ark for the safety of his family, and by this act he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which depends on faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>Through faith Abraham, upon being called to leave home and go into a land which he was soon to receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he was going to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>Through faith he came and made his home for a time in a land which had been promised to him, as if in a foreign country, living in tents together with Isaac and Jacob, sharers with him in the same promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>for he continually looked forward to the city which has the foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>Through faith even Sarah herself received strength to become a mother –although she was past the time of life for this– because she judged Him faithful who had given the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>And thus there sprang from one man, and him practically dead, a nation like the stars of the sky in number, and like the sands on the sea shore which cannot be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>All these died in the possession of faith. They had not received the promised blessings, but had seen them from a distance and had greeted them, and had acknowledged themselves to be foreigners and strangers here on earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>for men who acknowledge this make it manifest that they are seeking elsewhere a country of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And if they had cherished the remembrance of the country they had left, they would have found an opportunity to return;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>but, as it is, we see them eager for a better land, that is to say, a heavenly one. For this reason God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has now prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>Through faith Abraham, as soon as God put him to the test, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had joyfully welcomed the promises was on the point of sacrificing his only son</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>with regard to whom he had been told, »It is through Isaac that your posterity shall be traced.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>For he reckoned that God is even able to raise a man up from among the dead, and, figuratively speaking, it was from among the dead that he received Isaac again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>Through faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even in connexion with things soon to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>Through faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and, leaning on the top of his staff, worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>Through faith Joseph, when he was near his end, made mention of the departure of the descendants of Israel, and gave orders about his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>Through faith the child Moses was hid for three months by his parents, because they saw his rare beauty; and the king's edict had no terror for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>Through faith Moses, when he grew to manhood, refused to be known as Pharaoh's daughter's son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>having determined to endure ill-treatment along with the people of God rather than enjoy the short-lived pleasures of sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>because he deemed the reproaches which he might meet with in the service of the Christ to be greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt; for he fixed his gaze on the coming reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>Through faith he left Egypt, not being frightened by the king's anger; for he held on his course as seeing the unseen One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>Through faith he instituted the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>Through faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing over dry land, but the Egyptians, when they tried to do the same, were swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>Through faith the walls of Jericho fell to the ground after being surrounded for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>Through faith the notorious sinner Rahab did not perish along with the disobedient, for she had welcomed the spies and had sheltered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>And why need I say more? For time will fail me if I tell the story of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the Prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>men who, as the result of faith, conquered whole kingdoms, brought about true justice, obtained promises from God, stopped lions' mouths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>deprived fire of its power, escaped being killed by the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put to flight foreign armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received back their dear ones alive from the dead; and others were put to death with torture, refusing the deliverance offered to them–that they might secure a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Others again were tested by cruel mockery and by scourging; yes, and by chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried by temptation, they were killed with the sword. They went from place to place in sheepskins or goatskins, enduring want, oppression and cruelty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>(They were men of whom the world was not worthy.) They wandered across deserts and mountains, or hid themselves in caves and in holes in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>And although by their faith all these people won God's approval, none of them received the fulfilment of His great promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>for God had provided for them and us something better, so that apart from us they were not to attain to full blessedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Therefore, surrounded as we are by such a vast cloud of witnesses, let us fling aside every encumbrance and the sin that so readily entangles our feet. And let us run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>simply fixing our gaze upon Jesus, our Prince Leader in the faith, who will also award us the prize. He, for the sake of the joy which lay before Him, patiently endured the cross, looking with contempt upon its shame, and afterwards seated Himself – where He still sits– at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'>Therefore, if you would escape becoming weary and faint-hearted, compare your own sufferings with those of Him who endured such hostility directed against Him by sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.4'>In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted so as to endanger your lives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>and you have quite forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as sons, and which say, »My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline, and do not faint when He corrects you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.6'>for those whom the Lord loves He disciplines: and He scourges every son whom He acknowledges.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'>The sufferings that you are enduring are for your discipline. God is dealing with you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.8'>And if you are left without discipline, of which every true son has had a share, that shows that you are bastards, and not true sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>Besides this, our earthly fathers used to discipline us and we treated them with respect, and shall we not be still more submissive to the Father of our spirits, and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>It is true that they disciplined us for a few years according as they thought fit; but He does it for our certain good, in order that we may become sharers in His own holy character.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>Now, at the time, discipline seems to be a matter not for joy, but for grief; yet it afterwards yields to those who have passed through its training a result full of peace–namely, righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.12'>Therefore strengthen the drooping hands and paralysed knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.13'>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put entirely out of joint</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.14'>but may rather be restored. Persistently strive for peace with all men, and for that growth in holiness apart from which no one will see the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.15'>Be carefully on your guard lest there be any one who falls back from the grace of God; lest any root bearing bitter fruit spring up and cause trouble among you, and through it the whole brotherhood be defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.16'>lest there be a fornicator, or an ungodly person like Esau, who, in return for a single meal, parted with the birthright which belonged to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.17'>For you know that even afterwards, when he wished to secure the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no opportunity for undoing what he had done, though he sought the blessing earnestly with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.18'>For you have not come to a material object all ablaze with fire, and to gloom and darkness and storm and trumpet-blast and the sound of words–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.19'>a sound of such a kind that those who heard it entreated that no more should be added.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.20'>For they could not endure the order which had been given, »Even a wild beast, if it touches the mountain, shall be stoned to death;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.21'>and so terrible was the scene that Moses said, »I tremble with fear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.22'>On the contrary you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the ever-living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.23'>to the great festal gathering and Church of the first-born, whose names are recorded in Heaven, and to a Judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.24'>and to Jesus the negotiator of a new Covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks in more gracious tones than that of Abel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.25'>Be careful not to refuse to listen to Him who is speaking to you. For if they of old did not escape unpunished when they refused to listen to him who spoke on earth, much less shall we escape who turn a deaf ear to Him who now speaks from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.26'>His voice then shook the earth, but now we have His promise, »Yet again I will, once for all, cause not only the earth to tremble, but Heaven also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>Here the words »Yet again, once for all« denote the removal of the things which can be shaken –created things– in order that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>Therefore, receiving, as we now do, a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us cherish thankfulness so that we may ever offer to God an acceptable service, with godly reverence and awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.29'>For our God is also a consuming fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.13'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.1'>Let brotherly love always continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.2'>Do not neglect to show kindness to strangers; for, in this way, some, without knowing it, have had angels as their guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.3'>Remember prisoners, as if you were in prison with them; and remember those suffering ill-treatment, for you yourselves also are still in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.4'>Let marriage be held in honour among all, and let the marriage bed be unpolluted; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.5'>Your lives should be untainted by love for money. Be content with what you have; for God Himself has said, »I will never, never let go your hand: I will never never forsake you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.6'>So that we fearlessly say, »The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid: what can man do to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.7'>Remember your former leaders–it was they who brought you God's Message. Bear in mind how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.8'>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day–yes, and to the ages to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Do not be drawn aside by all sorts of strange teaching; for it is well to have the heart made stedfast through God's grace, and not by special kinds of food, from which those who scrupulously attend to them have derived no benefit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We Christians have an altar from which the ministers of the Jewish Tent have no right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>For the bodies of those animals of which the blood is carried by the High Priest into the Holy place as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>And for this reason Jesus also, in order, by His own blood, to set the people free from sin, suffered outside the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Therefore let us go to Him outside the camp, sharing the insults directed against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For we have no permanent city here, but we are longing for the city which is soon to be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>Through Him, then, let us continually lay on the altar a sacrifice of praise to God, namely, the utterance of lips that give thanks to His Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>And do not forget to be kind and liberal; for with sacrifices of that sort God is greatly pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders and be submissive to them. For they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will have to give account; that they may do this with joy and not with lamentation. For that would be of no advantage to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Keep on praying for us; for we are sure that we have clear consciences, and we desire to live nobly in every respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>I specially urge this upon you in order that I may be the more speedily restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now may God who gives peace, and brought Jesus, our Lord, up again from among the dead –even Him who, by virtue of the blood of the eternal Covenant, is the great Shepherd of the sheep–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>fully equip you with every grace that you may need for the doing of His will, producing in us that which will truly please Him through Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>Bear with me, brethren, when I thus exhort you; for, in fact, it is but a short letter that I have written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>You will rejoice to hear that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty. If he comes soon, I will see you with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Greet all your leaders and all God's people. The brethren from Italy send you greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace be with you all! Amen.</verse>
