        <description>The form in which the Bible is given here is not simply another example of the Bible story put into present-day English. The language used is Basic English. 
Basic English, produced by Mr C. K. Ogden of the Orthological Institute, is a simple form of the English language which, with 850 words, is able to give the sense of anything which may be said in English.</description>

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>I, a ruler in the church, send word to the well loved Gaius, for whom I have true love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>My loved one, it is my prayer that you may do well in all things, and be healthy in body, even as your soul does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>My loved one, you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have given witness to the church of your love for them: and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for, as is right for servants of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For they went out for love of the Name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>So it is right for us to take in such men as guests, so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I sent a letter to the church, but Diotrephes, whose desire is ever to have the first place among them, will not have us there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>So if I come, I will keep in mind the things he does, talking against us with evil words: and as if this was not enough, he does not take the brothers into his house, and those who are ready to take them in, he keeps from doing so, putting them out of the church if they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>My loved one, do not be copying what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true: and we give the same witness, and you are certain that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had much to say to you, but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I am hoping to see you in a short time, and to have talk with you face to face.\</verse>
