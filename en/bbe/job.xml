      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And he had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand camels, and a thousand oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great number of servants. And the man was greater than any of the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>His sons regularly went to one another's houses, and every one on his day gave a feast: and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And at the end of their days of feasting, Job sent and made them clean, getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all. For, Job said, It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God in their hearts. And Job did this whenever the feasts came round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the Lord said to the Satan, Where do you come from? And the Satan said in answer, From wandering this way and that on the earth, and walking about on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the Lord said to the Satan, Have you taken note of my servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a man without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Is it for nothing that Job is a god-fearing man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side, blessing the work of his hands, and increasing his cattle in the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But now, put out your hand against all he has, and he will be cursing you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the Lord said to the Satan, See, I give all he has into your hands, only do not put a finger on the man himself. And the Satan went out from before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And a man came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses were taking their food by their side:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the men of Sheba came against them and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The fire of God came down from heaven, burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The Chaldaeans made themselves into three bands, and came down on the camels and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, Your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brother's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>When a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house, and it came down on the young men, and they are dead; and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job got up, and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair, he went down on his face to the earth, and gave worship, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>With nothing I came out of my mother's body, and with nothing I will go back there; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; let the Lord's name be praised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did no sin, and did not say that God's acts were foolish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the Lord said to the Satan, Where do you come from? And the Satan said in answer, From wandering this way and that on the earth, and walking about on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the Lord said to the Satan, Have you taken note of my servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a man without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil? and he still keeps his righteousness, though you have been moving me to send destruction on him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Skin for skin, all a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But now, if you only put your hand on his bone and his flesh, he will certainly be cursing you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the Lord said to the Satan, See, he is in your hands, only do not take his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>And the Satan went out from before the Lord, and sent on Job an evil disease covering his skin from his feet to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a broken bit of a pot, and, seated in the dust, was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And his wife said to him, Are you still keeping your righteousness? Say a curse against God, and put an end to yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>And he said to her, You are talking like one of the foolish women. If we take the good God sends us, are we not to take the evil when it comes? In all this Job kept his lips from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>And Job's three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him. And they came every one from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. So they came together to a meeting-place, in order that they might go and make clear to Job their grief for him, and give him comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And lifting up their eyes when they were still far off, it did not seem that the man they saw was Job because of the change in him. And they gave way to bitter weeping, with signs of grief, and put dust on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they took their seats on the earth by his side for seven days and seven nights: but no one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>Job made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>That day--let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>That night--let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it did not keep the doors of my mother's body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother's body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one says a word, will it be a weariness to you? but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Truly, you have been a helper to others, and you have made feeble hands strong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words, and you have given strength to bent knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you; you are touched by it and your mind is troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not your fear of God your support, and your upright way of life your hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man? or when were the god-fearing ever cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed, and evil planted, get the same for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God destruction takes them, and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice, may be loud, the teeth of the young lions are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion comes to his end for need of food, and the young of the she-lion go wandering in all directions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>A word was given to me secretly, and the low sound of it came to my ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In troubled thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep comes on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came on me and shaking, and my bones were full of trouble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And a breath was moving over my face; the hair of my flesh became stiff:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>Something was present before me, but I was not able to see it clearly; there was a form before my eyes: a quiet voice came to my ears, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>May a man be upright before God? or a man be clean before his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Truly, he puts no faith in his servants, and he sees error in his angels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more those living in houses of earth, whose bases are in the dust! They are crushed more quickly than an insect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Between morning and evening they are completely broken; they come to an end for ever, and no one takes note.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>If their tent-cord is pulled up, do they not come to an end, and without wisdom?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Give now a cry for help; is there anyone who will give you an answer? and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish, and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly the curse came on his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>Now his children have no safe place, and they are crushed before the judges, for no one takes up their cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Their produce is taken by him who has no food, and their grain goes to the poor, and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For evil does not come out of the dust, or trouble out of the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But trouble is man's fate from birth, as the flames go up from the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me, I would make my prayer to God, and I would put my cause before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who does great things outside our knowledge, wonders without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>Lifting up those who are low, and putting the sad in a safe place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>Who makes the designs of the wise go wrong, so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their secret designs, and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>In the daytime it becomes dark for them, and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father, and the poor from the power of the strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor man has hope, and the mouth of the evil-doer is stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Truly, that man is happy who has training from the hand of God: so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the Ruler of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For after his punishment he gives comfort, and after wounding, his hands make you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will keep you safe from six troubles, and in seven no evil will come near you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>When there is need of food he will keep you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>He will keep you safe from the evil tongue; and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>You will make sport of destruction and need, and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth, and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And you will be certain that your tent is at peace, and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You will be certain that your seed will be great, and your offspring like the plants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You will come to your last resting-place in full strength, as the grain is taken up to the crushing-floor in its time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>See, we have made search with care, and it is so; it has come to our ears; see that you take note of it for yourself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>And Job made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.14.1'>As for man, the son of woman, his days are short and full of trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.2'>He comes out like a flower, and is cut down: he goes in flight like a shade, and is never seen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.3'>Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed, with the purpose of judging him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.4'>If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.5'>If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.6'>Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.7'>For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.8'>Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.9'>Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.10'>But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.11'>The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.12'>So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.13'>If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.14'>If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.15'>At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.16'>For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.17'>My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.18'>But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.19'>The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.20'>You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.21'>His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.14.22'>Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.15'>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.1'>And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.2'>Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.3'>Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.4'>Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.5'>For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.6'>It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.7'>Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.8'>Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.9'>What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.10'>With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.11'>Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.12'>Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.13'>So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.14'>What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.15'>Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.16'>How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.17'>Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.18'>(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.19'>For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.20'>The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.21'>A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.22'>He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.23'>He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.24'>He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.25'>Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.26'>Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.27'>Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.28'>And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.29'>He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.30'>He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.31'>Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.32'>His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.33'>He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.34'>For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.15.35'>Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.16'>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.1'>And Job made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.2'>Such things have frequently come to my ears: you are comforters who only give trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.3'>May words which are like the wind be stopped? or what is troubling you to make answer to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.4'>It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my soul's place; joining words together against you, and shaking my head at you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.5'>I might give you strength with my mouth, and not keep back the comfort of my lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.6'>If I say what is in my mind, my pain becomes no less: and if I keep quiet, how much of it goes from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.7'>But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear, and I am in the grip of all my trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.8'>It has come up as a witness against me, and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.9'>I am broken by his wrath, and his hate has gone after me; he has made his teeth sharp against me: my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.10'>Their mouths are open wide against me; the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face; all of them come together in a mass against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.11'>God gives me over to the power of sinners, sending me violently into the hands of evil-doers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.12'>I was in comfort, but I have been broken up by his hands; he has taken me by the neck, shaking me to bits; he has put me up as a mark for his arrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.13'>His bowmen come round about me; their arrows go through my body without mercy; my life is drained out on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.14'>I am broken with wound after wound; he comes rushing on me like a man of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.15'>I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin, and my horn is rolled in the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.16'>My face is red with weeping, and my eyes are becoming dark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.17'>Though my hands have done no violent acts, and my prayer is clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.18'>O earth, let not my blood be covered, and let my cry have no resting-place!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.19'>Even now my witness is in heaven, and the supporter of my cause is on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.20'>My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.21'>So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God, and between a son of man and his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.16.22'>For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.17'>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.1'>My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.2'>Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.3'>Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.4'>You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.5'>As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.6'>He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.7'>My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.8'>The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.9'>Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.10'>But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.11'>My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.12'>They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.13'>If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.14'>If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.15'>Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.17.16'>Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.18'>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.1'>Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.2'>How long will it be before you have done talking? Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.3'>Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.4'>But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.5'>For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.6'>The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.7'>The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.8'>His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.9'>His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.10'>The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.11'>He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.12'>His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.13'>His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.14'>He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.15'>In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.16'>Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.17'>His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.18'>He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.19'>He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.20'>At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.18.21'>Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.19'>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.1'>And Job made answer and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.2'>How long will you make my life bitter, crushing me with words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.3'>Ten times now you have made sport of me; it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.4'>And, truly, if I have been in error, the effect of my error is only on myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.5'>If you make yourselves great against me, using my punishment as an argument against me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.6'>Be certain that it is God who has done me wrong, and has taken me in his net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.7'>Truly, I make an outcry against the violent man, but there is no answer: I give a cry for help, but no one takes up my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.8'>My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by: he has made my roads dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.9'>He has put off my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.10'>I am broken down by him on every side, and I am gone; my hope is uprooted like a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.11'>His wrath is burning against me, and I am to him as one of his haters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.12'>His armies come on together, they make their road high against me, and put up their tents round mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.13'>He has taken my brothers far away from me; they have seen my fate and have become strange to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.14'>My relations and my near friends have given me up, and those living in my house have put me out of their minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.15'>I am strange to my women-servants, and seem to them as one from another country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.16'>At my cry my servant gives me no answer, and I have to make a prayer to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.17'>My breath is strange to my wife, and I am disgusting to the offspring of my mother's body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.18'>Even young children have no respect for me; when I get up their backs are turned on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.19'>All the men of my circle keep away from me; and those dear to me are turned against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.20'>My bones are joined to my skin, and I have got away with my flesh in my teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.21'>Have pity on me, have pity on me, O my friends! for the hand of God is on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.22'>Why are you cruel to me, like God, for ever saying evil against me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.23'>If only my words might be recorded! if they might be put in writing in a book!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.24'>And with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.25'>But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living, and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.26'>And ... without my flesh I will see God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.27'>Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.19.28'>If you say, How cruel we will be to him! because the root of sin is clearly in him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.20.1'>Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.20.14'>His food becomes bitter in his stomach; the poison of snakes is inside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.15'>He takes down wealth as food, and sends it up again; it is forced out of his stomach by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.16'>He takes the poison of snakes into his mouth, the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.17'>Let him not see the rivers of oil, the streams of honey and milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.18'>He is forced to give back the fruit of his work, and may not take it for food; he has no joy in the profit of his trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.19'>Because he has been cruel to the poor, turning away from them in their trouble; because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.20'>There is no peace for him in his wealth, and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.20.21'>He had never enough for his desire; for this cause his well-being will quickly come to an end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge? For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Give ear to me, and I will say what is in my mind; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>Word of you had come to my ears, but now my eye has seen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>For this cause I give witness that what I said is false, and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it came about, after he had said these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, I am very angry with you and your two friends, because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>And now, take seven oxen and seven sheep, and go to my servant Job, and give a burned offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will make prayer for you, that I may not send punishment on you; because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord had said. And the Lord gave ear to Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses, after he had made prayer for his friends: and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And the Lord's blessing was greater on the end of Job's life than on its start: and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats, and six thousand camels, and two thousand oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>And he had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he gave the first the name of Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</verse>
