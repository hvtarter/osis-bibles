      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>See her seated by herself, the town which was full of people! She who was great among the nations has become like a widow! She who was a princess among the countries has come under the yoke of forced work!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She is sorrowing bitterly in the night, and her face is wet with weeping; among all her lovers she has no comforter: all her friends have been false to her, they have become her haters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah has been taken away as a prisoner because of trouble and hard work; her living-place is among the nations, there is no rest for her: all her attackers have overtaken her in a narrow place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion are sad, because no one comes to the holy meeting; all her doorways are made waste, her priests are breathing out sorrow: her virgins are troubled, and it is bitter for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Those who are against her have become the head, everything goes well for her haters; for the Lord has sent sorrow on her because of the great number of her sins: her young children have gone away as prisoners before the attacker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And all her glory has gone from the daughter of Zion: her rulers have become like harts with no place for food, and they have gone in flight without strength before the attacker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem keeps in mind, in the days of her sorrow and of her wanderings, all the desired things which were hers in days gone by; when her people came into the power of her hater and she had no helper, her attackers saw their desire effected on her and made sport of her destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Great is the sin of Jerusalem; for this cause she has become an unclean thing: all those who gave her honour are looking down on her, because they have seen her shame: now truly, breathing out grief, she is turned back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>In her skirts were her unclean ways; she gave no thought to her end; and her fall has been a wonder; she has no comforter: see her sorrow, O Lord; for the attacker is lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The hand of her hater is stretched out over all her desired things; for she has seen that the nations have come into her holy place, about whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>Breathing out grief all her people are looking for bread; they have given their desired things for food to give them life: see, O Lord, and take note; for she has become a thing of shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Come to me, all you who go by! Keep your eyes on me, and see if there is any pain like the pain of my wound, which the Lord has sent on me in the day of his burning wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it has overcome them: his net is stretched out for my feet, I am turned back by him; he has made me waste and feeble all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>A watch is kept on my sins; they are joined together by his hand, they have come on to my neck; he has made my strength give way: the Lord has given me up into the hands of those against whom I have no power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>The Lord has made sport of all my men of war in me, he has got men together against me to send destruction on my young men: the virgin daughter of Judah has been crushed like grapes under the feet of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things I am weeping; my eye is streaming with water; because the comforter who might give me new life is far from me: my children are made waste, because the hater is strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion's hands are outstretched; she has no comforter; the Lord has given orders to the attackers of Jacob round about him: Jerusalem has become like an unclean thing among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>The Lord is upright; for I have gone against his orders: give ear, now, all you peoples, and see my pain, my virgins and my young men have gone away as prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I sent for my lovers, but they were false to me: my priests and my responsible men were breathing their last breath in the town, while they were looking for food to give them new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>See, O Lord, for I am in trouble; the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved; my heart is turned in me; for I have been uncontrolled: outside the children are put to the sword, and in the house there is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>Give ear to the voice of my grief; I have no comforter; all my haters have news of my troubles, they are glad because you have done it: let the day of fate come when they will be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Let all their evil-doing come before you; do to them as you have done to me for all my sins: for loud is the sound of my grief, and the strength of my heart is gone.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How has the daughter of Zion been covered with a cloud by the Lord in his wrath! he has sent down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, and has not kept in memory the resting-place of his feet in the day of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>The Lord has given up to destruction all the living-places of Jacob without pity; pulling down in his wrath the strong places of the daughter of Judah, stretching out on the earth the wounded, even her king and her rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>In his burning wrath every horn of Israel has been cut off; his right hand has been turned back before the attacker: he has put a fire in Jacob, causing destruction round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>His bow has been bent for the attack, he has taken his place with his hand ready, in his hate he has put to death all who were pleasing to the eye: on the tent of the daughter of Zion he has let loose his passion like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord has become like one fighting against her, sending destruction on Israel; he has sent destruction on all her great houses, making waste his strong places: increasing the grief and the sorrow of the daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And he has violently taken away his tent, as from a garden; he has made waste his meeting-place: the Lord has taken away the memory of feast and Sabbath in Zion, and in the passion of his wrath he is against king and priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord has given up his altar and has been turned in hate from his holy place; he has given up into the hands of the attacker the walls of her great houses: their voices have been loud in the house of the Lord as in the day of a holy meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>It is the Lord's purpose to make waste the wall of the daughter of Zion; his line has been stretched out, he has not kept back his hand from destruction: he has sent sorrow on tower and wall, they have become feeble together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her doors have gone down into the earth; he has sent destruction on her locks: her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; even her prophets have had no vision from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The responsible men of the daughter of Zion are seated on the earth without a word; they have put dust on their heads, they are clothed in haircloth: the heads of the virgins of Jerusalem are bent down to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>My eyes are wasted with weeping, the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved, my inner parts are drained out on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they are falling like the wounded in the open squares of the town, when their life is drained out on their mother's breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What example am I to give you? what comparison am I to make for you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what am I to make equal to you, so that I may give you comfort, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your destruction is great like the sea: who is able to make you well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>The visions which your prophets have seen for you are false and foolish; they have not made clear to you your sin so that your fate might be changed: but they have seen for you false words, driving you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All who go by make a noise with their hands at you; they make hisses, shaking their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, and saying, Is this the town which was the crown of everything beautiful, the joy of all the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All your haters are opening their mouths wide against you; making hisses and whistling through their teeth, they say, We have made a meal of her: certainly this is the day we have been looking for; it has come, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>The Lord has done that which was his purpose; he has put into force the orders which he gave in the days which are past; pulling down without pity, he has made your hater glad over you, lifting up the horn of those who were against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Let your cry go up to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let your weeping be flowing down like a stream day and night; give yourself no rest, let not your eyes keep back the drops of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Up! give cries in the night, at the starting of the night-watches; let your heart be flowing out like water before the face of the Lord, lifting up your hands to him for the life of your young children who are falling down, feeble for need of food, at the top of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>Look! O Lord, see to whom you have done this! Are the women to take as their food the fruit of their bodies, the children who are folded in their arms? are the priest and the prophet to be put to death in the holy place of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>The young men and the old are stretched on the earth in the streets; my virgins and my young men have been put to the sword: you have sent death on them in the day of your wrath, causing death without pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>As in the day of a holy meeting you have made fears come round me on every side, and no one got away or was kept safe in the day of the Lord's wrath: those who were folded in my arms, whom I took care of, have been sent to their destruction by my hater.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>By him I have been made to go in the dark where there is no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>By him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones, and I am bent low in the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>My soul is sent far away from peace, I have no more memory of good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>And I said, My strength is cut off, and my hope from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Keep in mind my trouble and my wandering, the bitter root and the poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>My soul still keeps the memory of them; and is bent down in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'>This I keep in mind, and because of this I have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.23'>They are new every morning; great is your good faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.24'>I said to myself, The Lord is my heritage; and because of this I will have hope in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.25'>The Lord is good to those who are waiting for him, to the soul which is looking for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.26'>It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.27'>It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.28'>Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.29'>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.30'>Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.31'>For the Lord does not give a man up for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.32'>For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.33'>For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.34'>In a man's crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.35'>In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.36'>In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.37'>Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.38'>Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.39'>What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.40'>Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.41'>Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.42'>We have done wrong and gone against your law; we have not had your forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.43'>Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us, cutting us off without pity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.44'>Covering yourself with a cloud, so that prayer may not get through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.45'>You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use, among the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.46'>The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.47'>Fear and deep waters have come on us, wasting and destruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.51'>The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.52'>They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.53'>They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.54'>Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.55'>I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.64'>You will give them their reward, O Lord, answering to the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.65'>You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.66'>You will go after them in wrath, and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.4.1'>How dark has the gold become! how changed the best gold! the stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.2'>The valued sons of Zion, whose price was the best gold, are looked on as vessels of earth, the work of the hands of the potter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.3'>Even the beasts of the waste land have full breasts, they give milk to their young ones: the daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the waste land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.4'>The tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink: the young children are crying out for bread, and no man gives it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.5'>Those who were used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets: those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.6'>For the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overturned suddenly without any hand falling on her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.4.10'>The hands of kind-hearted women have been boiling their children; they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.11'>The Lord has given full effect to his passion, he has let loose his burning wrath; he has made a fire in Zion, causing the destruction of its bases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.12'>To the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the haters would go into the doors of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.13'>It is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil-doing of her priests, by whom the blood of the upright has been drained out in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.14'>They are wandering like blind men in the streets, they are made unclean with blood, so that their robes may not be touched by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.15'>Away! unclean! they were crying out to them, Away! away! let there be no touching: when they went away in flight and wandering, men said among the nations, There is no further resting-place for them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.2'>Our heritage is given up to men of strange lands, our houses to those who are not our countrymen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.3'>We are children without fathers, our mothers are like widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.4'>We give money for a drink of water, we get our wood for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.5'>Our attackers are on our necks: overcome with weariness, we have no rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.6'>We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.7'>Our fathers were sinners and are dead; and the weight of their evil-doing is on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.8'>Servants are ruling over us, and there is no one to make us free from their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.9'>We put our lives in danger to get our bread, because of the sword of the waste land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.10'>Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.11'>They took by force the women in Zion, the virgins in the towns of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.12'>Their hands put princes to death by hanging: the faces of old men were not honoured.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.21'>Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.22'>But you have quite given us up; you are full of wrath against us.</verse>
