        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>He will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which gives its fruit at the right time, whose leaves will ever be green; and he will do well in all his undertakings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>For this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged, and the evil-doers will have no place among the upright,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth have taken their place, and the rulers are fixed in their purpose, against the Lord, and against the king of his selection, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let their chains be broken, and their cords taken from off us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>Then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing: the Lord will make sport of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then will his angry words come to their ears, and by his wrath they will be troubled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>But I have put my king on my holy hill of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will make clear the Lord's decision: he has said to me, You are my son, this day have I given you being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Make your request to me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage, and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>They will be ruled by you with a rod of iron; they will be broken like a potter's vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>So now be wise, you kings: take his teaching, you judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>For fear that he may be angry, causing destruction to come on you, because he is quickly moved to wrath. Happy are all those who put their faith in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.57'>Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.58'>They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;</verse>
