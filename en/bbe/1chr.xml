        <verse osisID='1Chr.11.23'>And he made an attack on an Egyptian, a very tall man about five cubits high, armed with a spear like a cloth-worker's rod; he went down to him with a stick, and pulling his spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, put him to death with that same spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.11.24'>These were the acts of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who had a great name among the thirty men of war.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.17'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.1'>Now when David was living in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, See, I am living in a house of cedar-wood, but the ark of the Lord's agreement is under the curtains of a tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.2'>And Nathan said to David, Do whatever is in your heart, for God is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.3'>But that same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.4'>Go and say to David my servant, The Lord says, You are not to make me a house for my living-place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.5'>For from the day when I took Israel up, till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from tent to tent, and from living-place to living-place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.6'>In all the places where I have gone with all Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, whom I made the keepers of my people, Why have you not made for me a house of cedar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.7'>So now, say to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.8'>And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.9'>And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be in the place which is theirs and never again be moved; and never again will they be made waste by evil men, as they were at first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.10'>From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will overcome all those who are against you; and I will make you great and the head of a line of kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.11'>And when the time comes for you to go to your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.12'>He will be the builder of my house, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.13'>I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son; and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him who was before you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.14'>But I will make his place in my house and in my kingdom certain for ever; and the seat of his authority will never be overturned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.15'>So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.16'>Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.21'>And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, making his name great and to be feared, driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.22'>For your people Israel you made yours for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.23'>And now, Lord, let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever, and do as you have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.24'>So let your words be made certain and your name be made great, when men say, The Lord of armies is the God of Israel; and when the family of David your servant is made strong before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.25'>For you, O my God, have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings; and so it has come into your servant's heart to make his prayer to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.26'>And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.17.27'>And now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you; you, O Lord, have given your blessing, and a blessing will be on it for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.18.5'>And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand Aramaeans.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.18.10'>He sent his son Hadoram to King David, to give him words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou; and he gave him all sorts of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.18.11'>These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold he had taken from all nations; from Edom and Moab and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from Amalek.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.3'>But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father, by sending comforters to you? is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.4'>So Hanun took David's servants, and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle, sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.5'>Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them. And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them; for the men were greatly shamed. And the king said, Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.6'>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.7'>So with this money they got thirty-two thousand war-carriages, and the help of the king of Maacah and his people, who came and took up their position in front of Medeba. And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.17'>And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.18'>And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and put to death Shophach, the captain of the army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.19.19'>And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants: and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.3'>And Joab said, May the Lord make his people a hundred times more in number than they are; but, my lord king, are they not all my lord's servants? why would my lord have this done? why will he become a cause of sin to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.4'>But the king's word was stronger than Joab's. So Joab went out and went through all Israel and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.5'>And Joab gave David the number of all the people; all the men of Israel, able to take up arms, were one million, one hundred thousand men; and those of Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men, able to take up arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.6'>But Levi and Benjamin were not numbered among them, for Joab was disgusted with the king's order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.10'>Go and say to David, The Lord says, Three things are offered to you: say which of them you will have, so that I may do it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.11'>So Gad came to David and said to him, The Lord says, Take whichever you will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.12'>Three years when there will not be enough food; or three months of war, when you will go in flight before your haters, being in great danger of the sword; or three days of the sword of the Lord, disease in the land, and the angel of the Lord taking destruction through all the land of Israel. Now give thought to the answer I am to take back to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.13'>And David said to Gad, This is a hard decision for me to make: let me come into the hands of the Lord, for great are his mercies: let me not come into the hands of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.15'>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem for its destruction: and when he was about to do so, the Lord saw, and had regret for the evil, and said to the angel of destruction, It is enough; do no more.

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.16'>And David, lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord there between earth and heaven, with an uncovered sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the responsible men, clothed in haircloth, went down on their faces.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.18'>Then the angel of the Lord gave orders to Gad to say to David that he was to go and put up an altar to the Lord on the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.23'>And Ornan said to David, Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems right to him. See, I give you the oxen for burned offerings and the grain-cleaning instruments for fire-wood, and the grain for the meal offering; I give it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.21.24'>And King David said to Ornan, No; I will certainly give you the full price for it, because I will not take for the Lord what is yours, or give a burned offering without payment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.5'>So they were put into groups, by the Lord's decision, one with another; for there were rulers of the holy place and rulers of the house of God among the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>Now as far as I am able, I have made ready what is needed for the house of my God; the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the silver things, and the brass for the brass things, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; beryls and jewels to be framed, and stones of different colours for ornament; all sorts of stones of great price, and polished building-stone, as much as is needed and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>And because this house of God is dear to me, I give my private store of gold and silver to the house of my God, in addition to all I have got ready for the holy house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>Even three thousand talents of gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of the best silver, for plating the walls of the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>Gold for the gold things, and silver for the silver things, and for every sort of work to be done by the expert workmen. Who then will come forward, offering himself this day for the Lord's work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the heads of families and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the controllers of the king's business, freely gave themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>And they gave for the use of the house of the Lord, five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.8'>And those who had stones of great price gave them to the store of the house of the Lord, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>Then the people were glad because their offerings were freely given, for with a true heart they freely gave what they had to the Lord; and David the king was full of joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>So David gave praise to the Lord before all the people; and David said, Praise be to you, O Lord the God of Israel, our father for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Yours, O Lord, is the strength and the power and the glory, and the authority and the honour: for everything in heaven and on earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are lifted up as head over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Wealth and honour come from you, and you are ruler over all, and in your hand is power and strength; it is in your power to make great, and to give strength to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>So now, our God, we give you praise, honouring the glory of your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>But who am I and what is my people, that we have power to give so freely in this way? for all things come from you, and what we have given you is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>For we, as all our fathers were, are like men from a strange country before you, who have got a place for a time in the land; our days on the earth are like a shade, and there is no hope of going on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>O Lord our God, all this store, which we have made ready for the building of a house for your holy name, comes from your hand and is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>And I am conscious, my God, that you are the searcher of hearts, taking pleasure in righteousness. As for me, with an upright heart I have freely given all these things; and I have seen with joy your people who are here to make their offerings freely to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the deepest thoughts of your people, and let their hearts be fixed and true to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>And give to Solomon my son a true heart, to keep your orders, your rules, and your laws, and to do all these things, and to put up this great house for which I have made ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>And David said to all the people, Now give praise to the Lord your God. And all the people gave praise to the Lord, the God of their fathers, with bent heads worshipping the Lord and the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>And they made offerings to the Lord, and gave burned offerings to the Lord, on the day after, a thousand oxen, a thousand sheep, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and a great wealth of offerings for all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>And with great joy they made a feast before the Lord that day. And they made Solomon, the son of David, king a second time, putting the holy oil on him to make him holy to the Lord as ruler, and on Zadok as priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>So Solomon was put on the seat of the Lord as king in place of his father David, and everything went well for him; and all Israel was under his authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>And all the chiefs and the men of war and all the sons of King David put themselves under the authority of Solomon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>And the Lord made Solomon great in the eyes of all Israel, clothing him with glory and honour such as no other king in Israel had had before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>Now David, the son of Jesse, was king over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>For forty years he was ruling as king over Israel, seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>And he came to his end after a long life, full of days and great wealth and honour; and Solomon his son became king in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now all the acts of David, first and last, are recorded in the words of Samuel the seer, and the words of Nathan the prophet, and the words of Gad the seer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>Together with all his rule and his power, and the events which took place in his time, in Israel and in all the kingdoms of other lands.</verse>
