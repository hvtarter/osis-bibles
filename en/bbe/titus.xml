        <description>The form in which the Bible is given here is not simply another example of the Bible story put into present-day English. The language used is Basic English. 
Basic English, produced by Mr C. K. Ogden of the Orthological Institute, is a simple form of the English language which, with 850 words, is able to give the sense of anything which may be said in English.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in agreement with the faith of the saints of God and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>In the hope of eternal life, which was made certain before eternal time, by the word of God who is ever true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>Who, in his time, made clear his word in the good news, of which, by the order of God our Saviour, I became a preacher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>I did not take you with me when I went away from Crete, so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there, placing men in authority over the churches in every town, as I said to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>Men having a good record, husbands of one wife, whose children are of the faith, children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For it is necessary for a Bishop to be a man of virtue, as God's servant; not pushing himself forward, not quickly moved to wrath or blows, not desiring profit for himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But opening his house freely to guests; a lover of what is good, serious-minded, upright, holy, self-controlled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>Keeping to the true word of the teaching, so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are men who are not ruled by law; foolish talkers, false teachers, specially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>By whom some families have been completely overturned; who take money for teaching things which are not right; these will have to be stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of their prophets has said, The men of Crete are ever false, evil beasts, lovers of food, hating work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true. So say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>Giving no attention to the fictions of the Jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the clean in heart all things are clean: but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean; they become unclean in mind and in thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They say that they have knowledge of God, while by their acts they are turning their backs on him; they are hated by all, hard-hearted, and judged to be without value for any good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>That old men are to be simple in their tastes, serious, wise, true in faith, in love, and of a quiet mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>That old women are to be self-respecting in behaviour, not saying evil of others, not given to taking much wine, teachers of that which is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>Training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>To be wise in mind, clean in heart, kind; working in their houses, living under the authority of their husbands; so that no evil may be said of the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>To the young men give orders to be wise and serious-minded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things see that you are an example of good works; holy in your teaching, serious in behaviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>Saying true and right words, against which no protest may be made, so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame, unable to say any evil of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Servants are to be under the authority of their masters, pleasing them in all things, without argument;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>Not taking what is not theirs, but giving clear signs of their good faith, in all things doing credit to the teaching of God our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God has come, giving salvation to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Training us so that, turning away from evil and the desires of this world, we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of God in this present life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Looking for the glad hope, the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing, and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>On all these points give teaching and help, and make clear what is right with all authority. Let all men give you honour.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities, to do what they are ordered, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>To say no evil of any man, not to be fighters, to give way to others, to be gentle in behaviour to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For in the past we were foolish, hard in heart, turned from the true way, servants of evil desires and pleasures, living in bad feeling and envy, hated and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the mercy of God our Saviour, and his love to man was seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but in the measure of his mercy, he gave us salvation, through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Which he gave us freely through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>So that, having been given righteousness through grace, we might have a part in the heritage, the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This is a true saying; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things, so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works. These things are good and of profit to men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But have nothing to do with foolish questionings, and lists of generations, and fights and arguments about the law; for they are of no profit and foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A man whose opinions are not those of the church, after a first and second protest, is to be kept out of your society;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Clearly he is in error and a sinner, being self-judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis: for it is my purpose to be there for the winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send Zenas, the man of law, and Apollos on their journey with all care, so that they may be in need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes, so that they may not be without fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me send you their love. Give our love to our friends in the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
