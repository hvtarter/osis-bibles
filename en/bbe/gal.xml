  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they gave glory to God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, by what strange powers have you been tricked, to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>Give me an answer to this one question, Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? having made a start in the Spirit, will you now be made complete in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose? if it is in fact to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Be certain, then, that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse: because it is said in the Writings, A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God, is clear; because, The upright will be living by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>And the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will have life by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brothers, as men would say, even a man's agreement, when it has been made certain, may not be put on one side, or have additions made to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham were the undertakings given, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a go-between is not a go-between of one; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>But I say that as long as the son is a child, he is in no way different from a servant, though he is lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the time had come, God sent out his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>That he might make them free who were under the law, and that we might be given the place of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, saying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You keep days, and months, and fixed times, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am in fear of you, that I may have been working for you to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>My desire for you, brothers, is that you may be as I am, because I am as you are. You have done me no wrong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh, or put shame on it; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My children, of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>Truly my desire is to be present with you now, using a changed voice; for I am troubled about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven makes a change in all the mass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brothers, if a man is taken in any wrongdoing, you who are of the Spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love; keeping watch on yourself, for fear that you yourself may be tested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Take on yourselves one another's troubles, and so keep the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing, he is tricked by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let every man make test of his work, and then will his cause for glory be in himself only, and not in his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>Because every man is responsible for his part of the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not tricked; God is not made sport of: for whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not get tired of well-doing; for at the right time we will get in the grain, if we do not give way to weariness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have the chance, let us do good to all men, and specially to those who are of the family of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See the size of the handwriting which I myself have made use of in writing to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>Those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh, put force on you to undergo circumcision; only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law; but they would have you undergo circumcision, so that they may have glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But far be it from me to have glory in anything, but only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me, and I for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For having circumcision is nothing, and not having circumcision is nothing, but only a new order of existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy, and on the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From this time on let no man be a trouble to me; because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. So be it.</verse>
