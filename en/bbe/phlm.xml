        <description>The form in which the Bible is given here is not simply another example of the Bible story put into present-day English. The language used is Basic English. 
Basic English, produced by Mr C. K. Ogden of the Orthological Institute, is a simple form of the English language which, with 850 words, is able to give the sense of anything which may be said in English.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.</verse>
