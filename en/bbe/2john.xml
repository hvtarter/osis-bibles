        <description>The form in which the Bible is given here is not simply another example of the Bible story put into present-day English. The language used is Basic English. 
Basic English, produced by Mr C. K. Ogden of the Orthological Institute, is a simple form of the English language which, with 850 words, is able to give the sense of anything which may be said in English.</description>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love.</verse>
