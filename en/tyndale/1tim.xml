        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>
As I besought the to abyde styll in Ephesus when I departed into Macedonia even so do that thou comaunde some that they teache no nother wise:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>
nether geve hede to fables and genealogies which are endlesse and brede doutes more then godly edyfyinge which is by fayth:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>
for ye ende of the comaundemet is love that cometh of a pure herte and of a good conscience and of fayth vnfayned:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>
fro the which thinges some have erred and have turned vnto vayne iangelinge
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>
because they wolde be doctours the scripture and yet vnderstonde not what they speake nether wherof they affirme. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>
We knowe yt the lawe is good yf a man vse it lawfully
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>
vnderstondinge this how yt the lawe is not geven vnto a righteous man bu vnto the vnrighteous and disobediet to the vngodly and to synners to vnholy and vnclean to murtherers of fathers and murtherers of mothers to manslears
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>
and whormongers: to them that defile them selves with mankynde: to menstealers: to lyars and to periured and so forth yf ther be eny other thinge that is cotrary to holsome doctrine

        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>
accordinge to the gospell of the glory of the blessed God which gospell is committed vnto me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>
And I thanke Christ Iesus oure Lorde which hath made me stronge: for he counted me true and put me in office
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>
when before I was a blasphemar and a persecuter and a tyraut. But I obtayned mercy because I dyd it ignorautly thorow vnbelefe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>
Neverthelater the grace of oure Lorde was more aboundaunt with fayth and love which is in Christ Iesu.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>
This is a true sayinge and by all meanes worthy to be receaved that Christ Iesus came into the world to save synners of whom I am chefe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>
Notwithstondinge for this cause was mercy geve vnto me that Iesus Christ shuld fyrst shewe on me all longe pacience vnto the ensample of them which shall in tyme to come beleve on him vnto eternall lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>
So then vnto god kynge everlastinge immortall invisible and wyse only be honoure and prayse for ever and ever Amen.

This commaundement commit I vnto the sonne Timotheus accordynge to the prophisies which in tyme past were prophisied of the yt thou in them shuldest fyght a good fyght

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>
I exhorte therfore that above all thynges prayers supplicacions intercessions and gevynge of thankes behad for all men:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>
for kynges and for all that are in auctorite that we maye live a quyet and a peasable life in all godlines and honestie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>
For that is good and accepted in the sight of god oure savioure

which will have all men saved and to come vnto the knowledge of ye trueth.
</verse>

Let the woman learne in silence with all subieccion.

I suffre not a woman to teache nether to have auctoricie over a man: but forto be in silence.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>
For Adam was fyrst formed and then Eve.
