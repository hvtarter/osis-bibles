Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God. To the saynctes which are at Ephesus and to them which beleve on Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>
Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>
Blessed be God the father of oure lorde Iesus Christ which hath blessed vs with all maner of spirituall blessinges in hevely thynges by Chryst
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>
accordynge as he had chosen vs in him before ye foudacio of ye worlde was layde that we shuld be saintes and without blame before him thorow loue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>
And ordeyned vs before thorow Iesus Christ to be heyres vnto him silfe accordinge to the pleasure of his will
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>
to ye prayse of the glorie of his grace where with he hath made vs accepted in the beloved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>
By whom we have redemption thorow his bloude euen the forgevenes of synnes accordynge to the riches of his grace
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>
which grace he shed on vs aboundantly in all wisdome and perceavaunce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>
And hath openned vnto vs the mistery of his will accordinge to his pleasure and purposed the same in hym silfe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>
to have it declared when the tyme were full come yt all thynges bothe ye thynges which are in heven and also the thynges which are in erthe shuld be gaddered togedder even in Christ:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>
that is to saye in him in whom we are made heyres and were therto predestinate accordynge to the purpose of him which worketh all thinges after the purpose of his awne will:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>
that we which before beleved in Christ shuld be vnto the prayse of his glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>
In whom also ye (after that ye hearde the worde of trueth I meane the gospell of youre saluacio wherin ye beleved) were sealed with the holy sprete of promes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>
which is the ernest of oure inheritaunce to redeme the purchased possession and that vnto the laude of his glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>
Wherfore even I (after that I hearde of the fayth which ye have in the lorde Iesu and love vnto all the saynctes)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>
cease not to geve thankes for you makynge mencion of you in my prayers
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>
that ye God of oure lorde Iesus Christ and the father of glory myght geve vnto you the sprete of wisdome and open to you the knowledge of him silfe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>
and lighten the eyes of youre myndes yt ye myght knowe what that hope is where vnto he hath called you and what the riches of his glorious inheritaunce is apon the sainctes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>
and what is the excedynge greatnes of his power to vs warde which beleve accordynge to the workynge of that his mighty power
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>
which he wrought in Christ when he raysed him from deeth and set him on his right honde in hevenly thynges
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>
above all rule power and myght and dominacion and above all names that are named not in this worlde only but also in the worlde to come:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>
and hath put all thynges vnder his fete and hath made him aboue all thynges ye heed of ye congregacion
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>
which is his body and the fulnes of him that filleth all in all thynges.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>
And hath quickened you also that were deed in treaspasse and synne
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>
in ye which in tyme passed ye walked acordynge to the course of this worlde and after the governer that ruleth in the ayer the sprete yt now worketh in the children of vnbelefe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>
amonge which we also had oure conversacion in tyme past in the lustes of oure flesshe and fullfilled the will of the flesshe and of the mynde: and were naturally the children of wrath even as wel as other.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>
But God which is rich in mercy thorow his greate love wherwith he loved vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>
even when we were deed by synne hath quickened vs together in Christ (for by grace are ye saved)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>
and hath raysed vs vp together and made vs sitte together in hevenly thynges thorow Christ Iesus
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>
for to shewe in tymes to come the excedynge ryches of his grace in kyndnes to vs warde in Christ Iesu.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>
For by grace are ye made safe thorowe fayth and that not of youre selves. For it is the gyfte of God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>
and commeth not of workes lest eny man shuld bost him silfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>
For we are his worckmanshippe created in Christ Iesu vnto good workes vnto the which god ordeyned vs before that we shuld walke in them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>
Wherfore remeber yt ye beynge in tyme passed getyls in ye flesshe and were called vncircucision to the which are called circucisio in the flesshe which circucision is made by hondes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>
Remeber I saye yt ye were at that tyme wt oute Christ and were reputed aliantes from the comen welth of Israel and were straugers fro the testamentes of promes and had no hope and were with out god in this worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>
But now in Christ Iesu ye which a whyle agoo were farre of are made nye by ye bloude of Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>
For he is oure peace whych hath made of both one and hath broken doune the wall yt was a stoppe bitwene vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>
and hath also put awaye thorow his flesshe the cause of hatred (that is to saye the lawe of commaundementes contayned in the lawe written) for to make of twayne one newe ma in him silfe so makynge peace:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>
and to recocile both vnto god in one body thorow his crosse and slewe hatred therby:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>
and came and preached peace to you which were afarre of and to them that were nye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>
For thorow him we both have an open waye in in one sprete vnto the father.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>
Now therfore ye are no moare straugers and foreners: but citesyns with the saynctes and of the housholde of god:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>
and are bilt apon the foundacion of the apostles and prophetes Iesus Christ beynge the heed corner stone
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>
in whom every bildynge coupled togedder groweth vnto an holy temple in ye lorde
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>
in who ye also are bilt togedder and made an habitacio for god in the sprete.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>
For this cause I Paul a in ye bodes of Iesus christ for youre sakes which are hethen:
</verse>

Yf ye have hearde of the ministracion of the grace of god which is geven me to you warde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>
For by revelacion shewed he this mistery vnto me as I wrote above in feawe wordes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>
wher by when ye rede ye maye knowe myne vnderstondynge in the mistery of Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>
which mistery in tymes passed was not opened vnto the sonnes of men as it is nowe declared vnto his holy apostles and prophetes by the sprete:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>
that the gentyls shuld be inheritours also and of the same body and partakers of his promis yt is in Christ by ye meanes of the gospell
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>
whereof I am made a minister by the gyfte of the grace of god geve vnto me thorow ye workynge of his power.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>
Vnto me the lest of all sayntes is this grace geven that I shuld preache amonge the gentyls the unsearchable ryches of Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>
and to make all men se what the felyshippe of the mistery is which from the begynnynge of the worlde hath bene hid in God which made all thynges thorow Iesus Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>
to the intent that now vnto the rulars and powers in heven myght be knowe by the cogregacion ye many folde wisdome of god
</verse>

accordinge to ye eternall purpose which he purposed in Christ Iesu oure lorde

by who we are bolde to drawe nye in ye trust which we have by faith on hi

Wherfore I desire yt ye faynt not because of my trybulacios for youre sakes: which is youre prayse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>
For this cause I bowe my knees vnto the father of oure lorde Iesus Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>
which is father over all that ys called father In heven and in erth
</verse>

Vnto him that is able to do excedynge aboudantly above all that we axe or thynke accordynge to the power that worketh in vs

      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>
I therfore which am in bondes for the lordes sake exhorte you that ye walke worthy of the vocacion wherwith ye are called
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>
in all humblenes of mynde and meknes and longe sufferynge forbearinge one another thorowe love
</verse>

beynge one body and one sprete eve as ye are called in one hope of youre callynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>
Let ther be but one lorde one fayth one baptim:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>
one god and father of all which is above all thorow all and in you all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>
Vnto every one of vs is geven grace acordinge to the measure of ye gyft of christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>
Wherfore he sayth: He is gone vp an hye and hath ledde captivitie captive and hath geven gyftes vnto men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>
That he ascended: what meaneth it but that he also descended fyrst into the lowest parties of the erth?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>
He that descended is even the same also that ascended vp even above all hevens to fulfill all thinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>
And the very same made some Apostles some prophetes some Evangelistes some Sheperdes some Teachers:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>
yt the sainctes might have all thinges necessarie to worke and minister with all to the edifyinge of the body of christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>
tyll we every one (in the vnitie of fayth and knowledge of the sonne of god) growe vp vnto a parfayte man after ye measure of age of the fulnes of Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>
That we hence forth be no moare chyldren wauerynge and caryed with every wynde of doctryne by the wylynes of men and craftynes wherby they laye a wayte for vs to deceave vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>
But let vs folowe the trueth in loue and in all thynges growe in him which is the heed that ys to saye Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>
in whom all the body ys coupled and knet togedder in every ioynt wherwith one ministreth to another (accordinge to the operacion as every parte hath his measure) and increaseth the body vnto the edyfyinge of it silfe in love.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>
This I saye therfore and testifie in ye lorde that ye hence forth walke not as other gentyls walke in vanitie of their mynde
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>
blynded in their vnderstondynge beynge straungers from the lyfe which is in god thorow the ignorancy that is in them because of the blyndnes of their hertes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>
which beynge past repentaunce have geven them selves vnto wantannes to worke all manner of vnclennes even with gredynes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>
But ye have not so learned Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>
if so be ye have hearde of him and are taught in him even as the trueth is in Iesu.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>
So then as concernynge the coversacion in tyme past laye from you that olde ma which is corrupte thorow the deceavable lustes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>
and be ye renued in the sprete of youre myndes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>
and put on that newe man which after the ymage of God is shapen in ryghtewesnes and true holynes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>
Wherfore put awaye lyinge and speake every man truth vnto his neghbour for as moche as we are members one of another.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>
Be angrye but synne not let not the sonne go doune apon your wrathe

nether geue place vnto ye backbyter.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>
Let him yt stole steale no moare but let him rather laboure with his hondes some good thinge that he maye have to geve vnto him that nedeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>
Let no filthy comunicacion procede out of youre mouthes: but yt whych is good to edefye with all when nede ys: that it maye have faveour with the hearers.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>
And greve not the holy sprete of God by whome ye are sealed vnto the daye of redempcion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>
Let all bitternes fearsnes and wrath rorynge and cursyd speakynge be put awaye from you with all maliciousnes.
</verse>

Be ye courteouse one to another and mercifull forgevynge one another eve as god for Christes sake forgave you.

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>
Be ye folowers of god as dere children
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>
and walke in love even as Christ loved vs and gave him silfe for vs an offerynge and a sacrifyce of a swete saver to god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>
So that fornicacion and all vnclennes or coveteousnes be not once named amonge you as it be commeth saynctes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>
nether filthynes nether folishe talkyng nether gestinge which are not comly: but rather gevynge of thankes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>
For this ye knowe yt no whormonger other vnclene person or coveteous person which is the worshipper of ymages hath eny inheritaunce in the kyngdome of Christ and of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>
Let no ma deceave you with vayne wordes. For thorow soche thinges cometh the wrath of God vpon the chyldre of vnbelefe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>
Be not therfore companions with them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>
Ye were once dercknes but are now light in the Lorde. Walke as chyldren of light.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>
For the frute of the sprete is in all goodnes rightewesnes and trueth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>
Accept that which is pleasinge to the Lorde:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>
and have no fellishippe with the vnfrutfull workes of dercknes: but rather rebuke them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>
For it is shame even to name those thinges which are done of them in secrete:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>
but all thinges when they are rebuked of the light are manifest. For whatsoever is manifest that same is light.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>
Wherfore he sayth: awake thou that slepest and stond vp from deeth and Christ shall geve the light.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>
Take hede therfore that ye walke circuspectly: not as foles: but as wyse
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>
redemynge the tyme: for ye dayes are evyll.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>
Wherfore be ye not vnwyse but vnderstonde what the will of the Lorde is
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>
and be not dronke with wyne wherin is excesse: but be fulfilled with the sprete
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>
speakynge vnto youre selves in psalmes and ymnes and spretuall songes synginge and makinge melodie to ye Lorde in youre hertes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>
gevinge thankes all wayes for all thinges vnto God the father in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>
submittinge youre selves one to another in the feare of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>
Wemen submit youre selves vnto youre awne husbandes as vnto the Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>
For the husbande is the wyves heed even as Christ is the heed of the congregacion and the same is the saveoure of the body.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>
Therfore as the cogregacion is in subieccion to Christ lykwyse let the wyves be in subieccion to their husbandes in all thinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>
Husbandes love youre wyves even as Christ loved the congregacion and gave him silfe for it
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>
to sanctifie it and clensed it in the fountayne of water thorow the worde
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>
to make it vnto him selfe a glorious congregacion with oute spot or wrynckle or eny soche thinge: but that it shuld be holy and with out blame.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>
So ought men to love their wyves as their awne bodyes. He that loveth his wyfe loveth him sylfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>
For no ma ever yet hated his awne flesshe: but norissheth and cherisseth it even as the lorde doth the congregacion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>
For we are members of his body of his flesshe and of his bones.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>
For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cotinue with his wyfe and two shalbe made one flesshe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>
