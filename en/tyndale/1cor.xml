Paul by vocacion an Apostle of Iesus Christ thorow the will of God and brother Sostenes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>
Vnto the congregacion of God which is at Corinthum. To them that are sanctified in Christ Iesu sainctes by callynge with all that call on the name of oure lorde Iesus Christ in every place both of theirs and of oures
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>
Grace be with you and peace fro God oure father and from the lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>
I thanke my God all wayes on youre behalfe for ye grace of God which is geuen you by Iesus Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>
that in all thinges ve are made riche by him in all lerninge and in all knowledge
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>
even as the testimony of Iesus Christ was confermed in you)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>
so that ye are behynde in no gyft and wayte for the apperynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>
which shall streght you vnto ye ende that ye maye be blamelesse in ye daye of oure lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>
ffor god is faythfull by whom ye are called vnto ye fellishyppe of his sonne Iesus Christe oure lorde
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>
I beseche you brethre in ye name of oure lorde Iesus Christ that ye all speake one thynge and that there be no dissencion amoge you: but be ye knyt together in one mynde and in one meaynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>
It is shewed vnto me (my brethren) of you by them that are of the housse of Cloe that ther is stryfe amonge you. And this is it that I meane:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>
how that comelie amonge you one sayeth: I holde of Paul: another I holde of Apollo: ye thyrde I holde of Cephas: ye four ye I holde of Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>
Ys Christ devided? was Paul crucified for you? ether were ye baptised in ye name of Paul?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>
I thanke God that I christened none of you but Crispus and Gayus
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>
lest eny shulde saye that I had baptised in myne awne name.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>
I baptised also the housse of Stephana. Forthermore knowe I not whether I baptised eny man or no.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>
For Christ sent me not to baptyse but to preache ye gospell not with wysdome of wordes lest the crosse of Christ shuld have bene made of none effecte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>
For ye preachinge of the crosse is to them yt perisshe folishnes: but vnto vs which are saved it is ye power of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>
For it is written: I will destroye the wysdome of the wyse and will cast awaye the vnderstondinge of the prudet.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>
Where is the wyse? Where is the scrybe? Where is the searcher of this worlde?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>
Hath not God made the wysdome of this worlde folisshnes? For when the worlde thorow wysdome knew not God in ye wysdome of God: it pleased God thorow folisshnes of preachinge to save them yt beleve.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>
For ye Iewes requyre a signe and the Grekes seke after wysdome.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>
But we preache Christ crucified vnto the Iewes an occasion of fallinge and vnto the Grekes folisshnes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>
but vnto the which are called both of Iewes and Grekes we preache Christ ye power of God and the wysdome of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>
For the folishnes of God is wyser then me: and the weakenes of God is stronger then men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>
Brethren loke on youre callinge how that not many wyse men after the flesshe not many myghty not many of hye degre are called:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>
but God hath chosen the folysshe thinges of the worlde to confounde the wyse. And God hath chosyn the weake thinges of the worlde to confounde thinges which are mighty.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>
And vile thinges of the worlde and thinges which are despysed hath God chosen yee and thinges of no reputacion for to brynge to nought thinges of reputacion
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>
that no flesshe shulde reioyce in his presence.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>
And vnto him partayne ye in Christ Iesu which of God is made vnto vs wysdome and also rightewesnes and saunctifyinge and redempcion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>
That accordinge as it is written: he which reioyseth shulde reioyce in the Lorde.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>
And I brethren when I came to you came not in gloriousnes of wordes or of wysdome shewynge vnto you the testimony of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>
Nether shewed I my selfe that I knewe eny thinge amonge you save Iesus Christ eve the same that was crucified.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>
And I was amoge you in weaknes and in feare and in moche treblinge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>
And my wordes and my preachinge were not with entysynge wordes of manes wysdome: but in shewinge of ye sprete and of power
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>
that youre fayth shuld not stonde in ye wysdome of me but in yt power of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>
That we speake of is wysdome amonge them that are perfecte: not the wysdome of this worlde nether of the rulars of this worlde (which go to nought)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>
but we speake ye wysdome of God which is in secrete and lieth hyd which God ordeyned before the worlde vnto oure glory:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>
which wysdome none of ye rulars of the worlde knewe. For had they knowe it they wolde not have crucified the Lorde of glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>
But as it is written: The eye hath not sene and the eare hath not hearde nether have entred into the herte of man ye thinges which God hath prepared for them that love him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>
But God hath opened them vnto vs by his sprete. For ye sprete searcheth all thinges ye the bottome of Goddes secretes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>
For what man knoweth the thinges of a ma: save ye sprete of a man which is with in him? Even so ye thinges of God knoweth no man but ye sprete of god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>
And we have not receaved the sprete of ye worlde: but the sprete which cometh of god for to knowe the thinges that are geve to vs of god
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>
which thinges also we speake not in the conynge wordes of manes wysdome but with the conynge wordes of the holy goost makynge spretuall coparesons of spretuall thinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>
For ye naturall man perceaveth not the thinges of the sprete of god. For they are but folysshnes vnto him. Nether can he perceave them because he is spretually examined.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>
But he that is spretuall discusseth all thinges: yet he him selfe is iudged of no ma.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>
For who knoweth the mynde of the Lorde other who shall informe him? But we vnderstonde the mynde of Christ.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>
And I coulde not speake vnto you brethre as vnto spretuall: but as vnto carnall even as it were vnto babes in Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>
I gave you mylke to drinke and not meate. For ye then were not stronge no nether yet are.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>
For ye are yet carnall. As longe verely as ther is amoge you envyige stryfe and dissencio: are ye not carnall and walke after ye manner of me?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>
As loge as one sayth I holde of Paul and another I am of Apollo are ye not carnall?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>
What is Paul? What thinge is Apollo? Only miministers are they by who ye beleved even as the Lorde gave every ma grace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>
I have planted: Apollo watred: but god gave increace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>
So then nether is he that planteth eny thinge nether he yt watreth: but god which gave the increace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>
He that planteth and he that watreth are nether better then the other. Every man yet shall receave his rewarde accordynge to his laboure.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>
We are goddis labourers ye are goddis husbandrye ye are goddis byldynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>
Accordynge to the grace of god geven vnto me as a wyse bylder have I layde the foundacio And another bylt thero But let every ma take hede how he bildeth apo.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>
For other foundacion can no man laye then yt which is layde which is Iesus Christ.
</verse>

Yf eny man bilde on this foundacion golde silver precious stones tymber haye or stoble:
</verse>

every mannes worke shall appere. For the daye shall declare it and it shalbe shewed in fyre. And ye fyre shall trye euery mannes worke what it is.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>
Yf eny mannes worke yt he hath bylt apon byde he shall receave a rewarde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>
If eny manes worke burne he shall suffre losse: but he shalbe safe him selfe: neverthelesse yet as it were thorow fyre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>
Are ye not ware that ye are the temple of god and how that the sprete of god dwelleth in you?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>
Yf eny man defyle the temple of god him shall god destroye. For the temple of god is holy which temple ye are.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>
Let no man deceave him silfe. Yf eny man seme wyse amonge you let him be a fole in this worlde that he maye be wyse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>
For ye wisdome of this worlde is folysshnes with god. For it is writte: he compaseth the wyse in their craftynes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>
And agayne God knoweth the thoughtes of the wyse that they be vayne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>
Therfore let no ma reioyce in men. For all thinges are youres whether it be Paul other Apollo other Cephas: whether it be ye worlde other lyfe other deeth whether they be present thinges or thinges to come: all are youres 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>
and ye are Christes and Christ is goddis.

Let men this wyse esteme vs eve as the ministers of Christ and disposers of ye secretes of God.

Furthermore it is requyred of the disposers that they be founde faithfull.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>
With me is it but a very smal thinge that I shuld be iudged of you ether of (mans daye) No I iudge not myn awne selfe.

Now ye are full: now ye are made rych: ye raygne as kinges with out vs: and I wold to god ye dyd raygne that we might raygne with you.

Me thinketh that God hath set forth vs which are Apostles for the lowest of all as it were me appoynted to deeth. For we are a gasyngestocke vnto the worlde and to ye angels and to men.

We are foles for Christes sake and ye are wyse thorow Christ. We are weake and ye are stroge. Ye are honorable and we are despised.

I write not these thinges to shame you: but as my beloved sonnes I warne you.

For though ye have ten thousande instructours in Christ: yet have ye not many fathers. In Christ Iesu I have begotten you thorowe ye gospell.

Wherfore I desyre you to folowe me.
