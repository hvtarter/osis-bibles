        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>
These be the wordes which Moses spake vnto all Israel, on the other syde Iordayne in the wildernesse and in the feldes by the red see, betwene Phara ad Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Disahab
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>
.xij. dayes iurney from Horeb vnto Cades bernea, by the waye that leadeth vnto mount Seir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>
And it fortuned the first daye of the .xi. moneth in the fortieth yere, that Moses spake vnto the childern of Israel acordinge vnto all that the Lorde had geuen him in commaundment vnto them,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>
after that he had smote Sihon the kynge of the Amorites which dwelt in Hesbon, and Og kinge of Basan which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>
On the other syde Iordayne in the londe of Moab, Moses begane to declare this lawe saynge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>
the Lorde oure God spake vnto us in Horeb sayenge: Ye haue dwelt longe ynough in this mount:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>
departe therfore and take youre iurney and goo vnto the hilles of the Amorites and vnto all places nye there vnto: both feldes, hilles and dales: and vnto the south and vnto the sees syde in the londe of Canaan, and vnto libanon: euen vnto the greate ryuer Euphrates.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>
Beholde, I haue set the londe before you: goo in therfore and possesse the londe which the Lord sware vnto youre fathers Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, to geue vnto them and their seed after them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>
And I sayde vnto yov the same season: I am not able to bere you myselfe alone.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>
For the Lorde youre God hath multiplyed you: so that ye are this daye as the starres of heauen in numbre
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>
(the Lorde god of youre fathers make you a thousande tymes so many moo as ye are, and blesse you as he hath promysed you)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>
how (sayde I) can I myselfe alone, beare the combraunce, charge and stryffe that is amonge you:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>
brynge therfore men of wisdome and of vnderstondinge and expert knowne amonge youre trybes, that I maye make them ruelars ouer you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>
And ye answered me and sayed: that which thou hast spoken is good to be done.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>
And then I toke the heedes of youre trybes, men of wysdome and that were expert, and made them ruelers ouer you: captaynes ouer thousandes and ouer hundredes ouer fyftye and ouer ten, and officers amonge youre trybes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>
And I charged youre Iudges the same tyme sayenge: heare youre brethern and iudge righteously betwene euery man and his brother and the straunges that is with him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>
Se that ye knowe no man in Iudgement: but heare the small as well as the greate and be afrayed of no man, for the lawe is Gods. And the cause that is to harde for you, brynge vnto me and I will heare it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>
And I commaunded you the same season, all the thinges which ye shulde doo.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>
And then we departed from Horeb and walked thorow all that greate and terreble wildernesse as ye haue sene alonge by the waye that ledeth vnto the hilles of the Amorites, as the Lorde oure God commaunded us, and came to Cades bernea.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>
And there I sayed vnto you: Ye are come vnto the hilles of the Amorites, which the Lorde oure God doth geue vnto us.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>
Beholde the Lorde thi God hath sett the londe before the, goo vpp and conquere it, as the Lorde God of thy fathers sayeth vnto the: feare not, nether be discoraged.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>
And then ye came vnto me euery one and sayed: Let us sende men before us, to serche us out the londe and to brynge us worde agayne, both what waye we shall goo vpp by, and vnto what cities we shall come.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>
And the sayenge pleassed me well and I toke .xij. men of you, of euery trybe one.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>
And they departed and went vp in to the hye contre and came vnto the ryuer Escoll, and serched it out,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>
and toke of the frute of the londe in their hondes and brought it doune vnto us and brought us worde agayne and sayde: it is a good lande which the Lorde oure God doeth geue us.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>
Notwithstondinge ye wolde not consente to goo vpp, but were dishobedient vnto the mouth of the Lorde youre God,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>
ad murmured in youre tentes and sayde: because the Lorde hateth us, therfore he hath brought us out of the londe of Egipte, to delyuer us in to the handes of the Amorites and to destroye us.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>
How shall we goo vpp? Oure brethern haue discoraged oure hartes sayenge: the people is greater and taller than we, ad the cities are greatte and walked euen vpp to heauen, and moreouer we haue sene the sonnes of the Enakimes there.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>
And I sayed vnto you: dreade not nor be afrayed of the:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>
The Lorde youre God which goeth before you, he shall fyghte for you, acordynge to all that he dyd vnto you in Egipte before youre eies
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>
ad in the wildernesse: as thou hast sene how that the Lorde thy God bare the as a man shulde beare his sonne, thorow out all the waye which ye haue gone, vntill ye came vnto this place.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>
And yet for all this sayenge ye dyd not beleue the Lorde youre God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>
which goeth the waye before you, to serche you out a place to pitche youre tentes in, in fyre by nyght, that ye myghte se what waye to go and in a cloude by daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>
And the Lorde herde the voyce of youre wordes and was wroth and swore sayenge,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>
there shall not one of these men of this frowarde generacion se that good londe which I sware to geue vnto youre fathers,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>
saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, he shall se it, and to him I will geue the londe which he hath walked in ad to his childern, because he hath contynually folowed the Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>
Likewise the Lorde was angrye with me for youre sakes sayenge: thou also shalt not go in thiter.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>
But Iosua the sone of Nun which stondeth before the, he shall go in thither. Bolde him therfore for he shall deuyde it vnto Israel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>
Moreouer youre childern which ye sayed shulde be a praye, and youre sonnes which knowe nether good nor bad this daye, they shall goo in thither ad vnto them I will geue it, ad they shall enioye it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>
But as for you, turne backe and take youre iurneye in to the wildernesse: euen the waye to the reed see.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>
Than ye answered and sayed vnto me: We haue synned agenst the Lorde: we will goo vp and fyghte, acordinge to all that the Lorde oure God comaunded us. And whe ye had gyrde on euery man his wepons of warre and were ready to goo vp in to the hilles,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>
the Lorde sayed vnto me: saye vnto the, se that ye go not vp and that ye fighte not, for I am not amoge you: lest ye be plaged before youre enemies.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>
And whe I told you ye wold not heare: but disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde, and went presumptously vp in to the hilles.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>
The the Amorites which dwelt in those hilles, came out agenst you and chased you as bees doo, and hewed you in Seir, eue vnto Horma.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>
And ye came agayne and wepte before the Lorde: but the Lorde wolde not heare youre voyce nor geue you audience.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>
And so ye abode in Cades aloge season, acordinge vnto the tyme that ye there dwelt.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>
Then we turned and toke oure iurney in to the wildernesse, euen the waye to the red see as the Lord comaunded me. And we compassed the mountayns of Seir a loge tyme
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>
The the Lorde spake vnto me saienge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>
Ye haue copassed this mountayns loge ynough, turne you northwarde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>
And warne the people sayenge: Ye shall goo thorow the costes of youre brethern the childern of Esau which dwell in Seir, and they shalbe afrayed of you: But take good hede vnto youre selues that
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>
ye prouoke the not, for I wil not geue you of their lode, no not so moch as a fote breadeth: because I haue geue mount Seir vnto Esau to possesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>
Ye shall bye meate of the for money to eate and ye shall bye water of the for money to drike.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>
For the Lorde thy God hath blessed the in all the workes of thine hade, ad knew the as thou wetest thorow this greate wildernesse. Moreouer the Lorde thi God hath bene with the this .xl yeres, so that thou hast lacked nothinge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>
And whe we were departed from oure brethern the childern of Esau which dwelt in Seir by the felde waye from Elath ad Ezion Gaber, we turned ad went the waye to the wildernesse of Moab.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>
The the Lorde sayed vnto me se that thou vexe not the Moabites, nethet prouoke the to batayle for I will not geue the of their lode to possesse: because I haue geue Ar vnto the childern of loth to possesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>
The Emimes dwelt there in in tymes past, a people greate, many ad tal, as the Enakimes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>
which also were take for geantes as the Enakimes: And the Moabites called the Emymes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>
In like maner the Horimes dwelt in Seir before time which the childern of Esau cast out, ad destroyed the before them and dwelt there in their stede: as Israel dyd in the londe of his possessio which the Lorde gaue them
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>
Now ryse vpp (sayed I) ad get you ouer the ryuer Zared: ad we went ouer the ryuer Zared.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>
The space in which we came from Cades bernea vntill we were come ouer the ryuer Zared was .xxxviij. yeres: vntill all the generacion of the men of warre were wasted out of the host as the Lorde sware vnto the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>
For in dede the hande of the Lorde was agest the, to destroye them out of the host, till they were consumed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>
And as soone as all the men of warre were consumed and deed from amonge the people,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>
then the Lorde spake vnto me sayenge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>
Thou shalt goo thorow Ar the coste of Moab this daye,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>
and shalt come nye vnto the childern of Ammon: se that thou vexe them not, nor yet prouoke them. For I will not geue the of the londe of the childern of Ammon to possesse, because I haue geuen it vnto the childern of loth to possesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>
That also was taken for a londe of geauntes and geauntes dwelt therim in olde tyme, and the Ammonites called them Zamzumyms.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>
A people that was great, many and taule, as the Enakyms. But the Lorde destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they cast them out and they dwelt there i their steade:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>
as he dyd for the childern of Esau which dwell in Seir: eue as he destroyed the horyms before them, ad they cast them out and dwell in their steade vnto this daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>
And the Avims which dwelt in Hazarim eue vnto Aza, the Caphthoryms which came out of Caphthor destroyed them and dwelt in their rowmes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>
Ryse vp, take youre yourney and goo ouer the ryuer Arnon. Beholde, I haue geuen in to thy had Siho the Amorite kynge of Hesbo, ad his londe. Goo to and conquere and prouoke hi to batayle.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>
This daye I will begynne to send the feare and dreade of the vppon all nacions that are vnder al portes of heauen: so that whe they heare speake of the, they shall tremble and quake for feare of the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>
Then I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of kedemoth vnto Syhon kynge of Hesbon, with wordes of peace saynge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>
Let me goo thorow thy londe. I will goo allweyes alonge by the hye waye and will nether turne vnto the righte hande nor to the left.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>
Sell me meate for money for to eate, and geue me drinke for money for to drynke: I will goo thorowe by fote only
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>
(as the childern of Esau dyd vnto me whiche dwell in Seir and the Moabites whiche dwell in Ar) vntyll I be come ouer Iordayne, in to the londe which the Lorde oure God geueth vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>
But Sihon the kinge of Hesbon wolde not let vs passe by him, for the Lord thy God had hardened his sprite and made his herte tough because he wold delyuer him in to thy hondes as it is come to passe this daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>
And the Lorde sayed vnto me: beholde, I haue begonne to set Sihon and his londe before the: goo to and conquere, that thou mayst possesse his londe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>
Then both Sihon and all his people came out agenst vs vnto batayle at Iahab.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>
And the Lorde set him before vs, and we smote hym and his sonnes and all hys people.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>
And we toke all his cities the same season, and destroyed all the cities with men, wemen, and childern ad let nothinge remayne,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>
saue the catell only we caught vnto oure selues and the spoyle of the cities which we toke,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>
from Aroer vppon the brynke off the riuer off Arnon, and the citie in the ryuer, vnto Gilead: there was not one citye to stronge for vs. The Lorde oure God delyuered all vnto vs:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>
only vnto the londe of the childern of Ammon ye came not, nor vnto all the coste of the riuer Iabock ner vnto the cities in the mountaynes, nor vnto what soeuer the Lorde oure God forbade vs.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>
Then we turned and went vpp the waye to Basan. And Og the kinge of Basan came out agenst vs. both he and all his people to batayle at Edrey.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>
And the Lorde sayed vnto me: feare him not, for I haue delyuered him and all his people ad his lande in to thy hande ad thou shalt deale with hi as thou dealest with Sihon kynge of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>
And so the Lorde oure God delyuered in to oure handes, Og also the kinge off Basan and al his folke, And we smote him vntyll noughte was left him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>
And we toke all his cities the same ceason (for there was not a citie whiche we toke not from them) euen .iij. score cities, all the region of Argob, the kyngdome of Og in Basan.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>
All these cities were made stronge with hye walles, gates and barres, besyde vnwalled townes a greate maynye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>
And we vtterly destroyed them, as we played with Sihon kynge off Hesbon: bringing to nought al the cities with men, wemen and childern.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>
But all the catell and the spoyle of the cities, we caughte for oure selues.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>
And thus we toke the same ceason, the lode out of the hande of two kynges of the Amorites on the other syde Iordayne, from the ryuer of Arnon vnto mount Hermon
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>
(which Hermon the Sidons call Sirion, but the Amorites call it Senyr)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>
all the cities in the playne ad all Gilead and all Basan vnto Salcha and Edrei, cities of the kingdome of Og in Basan.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>
For only Og kynge of Basan remayned of the remnaut of the geauntes: beholde, his yernen bed is yet at Rabath amonge the childern off Ammo .ix. cubettes longe ad, .iiij. cubetes brode, of the cubettes of a man.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>
And when we had conquered this londe the same tyme, I gaue from Aroer which is apon the riuer of Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead and the cities thereof vnto the Rubenites, and Gadites.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>
And the rest of Gilead and all Basan the kingdome of Og, I gaue vnto the halfe trybe of Manasse: all the regio of Argob with all Basan was called the londe of geauntes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>
Iair the sonne of Manasse toke all the region of Argob vnto the costes of Gesuri ad Maachati, and called the townes of Basan after his owne name: the townes of Iair vnto thys daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>
And I gaue half Gilead vnto Machir.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>
And vnto Ruben ad Gad, I gaue from Gilead vnto the ryuer of Arnon ad half the valey ad the coste, eue vnto the ryuer Iabock which is the border of the childern of Ammon,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>
and the feldes ad Iordayne with the coste, from Cenereth even vnto the see in the felde which is the salt see vnder the sprynges off Pisga eastwarde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>
And I commaunded you the same tyme (ye Ruben ad Gad) sayeng: the Lorde your God hath geuen you this londe to enioye it: se that ye go harnessed before youre brethern the childern of Israel, all that are me of warre amonge you.
</verse>

Youre wyues only youre childern ad youre catell (for I wote that ye haue moch catell) shall abyde in youre cities which I haue geuen you,

vntyll the Lorde haue geue rest vnto your brethern as well as vnto you, and vntyll they also haue conquered the londe which the Lorde youre God hath geuen them beyonde Iordayne: and then returne agayne euery ma vnto his possession which I haue geue you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>
And I warned Iosua the same tyme sayeng thyne eyes haue sene all that the Lorde youre God hath done vnto these two kynges, eue so the Lorde will doo vnto all kyngdomes whither thou goest.

Feare them not, for the Lorde youre God he it is that fighteth for you.

And I besoughte the Lorde the same tyme sayenge:
