The worde of the lorde came vn to the prophete Ionas ye sonne of Amithai sayenge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.2'>
ryse and gett the to Niniue that greate citie and preach vn to the how that theyr wekednesse is come vpp before me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.3'>
And Ionas made hi ready to fle to Tharsis fro the presens of ye lorde and gatt hym downe to Ioppe and founde there a sheppe ready to goo to Tharsis and payed his fare and wet aborde to goo with them to Tharsis fro the presens of the lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.4'>
But ye lorde hurled a greate winde in to ye se so that there was a myghtie tepest in the se: in so moch yt the shepp was lyke to goo in peces.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.5'>
And the mariners were afrayed and cried euery man vn to his god and cast out ye goodes yt were in ye sheppe in to ye se to lighten it of the. But Ionas gatt him vnder the hatches and layed him downe and slombrede.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.6'>
And ye master of the sheppe came to him and sayd vn to hi why slomberest thou? vpp and call vn to thy god that God maye thinke on vs that we perish not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.7'>
And they sayde one to a nother come and lett vs cast lottes to know for whose cause we are thus troublede. And they cast lottes. And ye lott fell vppon Ionas.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.8'>
The they said vnto hi tel vs for whose cause we are thus trowbled: what is thine occupacio whence comest thou how is thy cotre called and of what nacion art thou?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.9'>
And he answered the I am an Ebrue: and the lord God of heuen which made both se and drie land I feare.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.10'>
Then were the men exceadingly afrayd and sayd vn to him why diddest thou so? For they knew that he was fled from the presens of the lorde because he had told them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.11'>
Then they sayd vn to hym what shall we doo vnto the that the se maye cease fro trowblinge vs? For the se wrought and was trowblous.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.12'>
And he answered them take me and cast me in to the se and so shall it lett you be in reste: for I wotte it is for my sake that this greate tempest is come vppon you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.13'>
Neuerthelesse the men assayed wyth rowenge to bringe the sheppe to lande: but it wold not be because the se so wrought and was so trowblous agenst them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.14'>
Wherefore they cried vn to the lorde and sayd: O lorde latt vs not perih for this mans deeth nether laye innocet bloud vn to oure charge: for thou lorde even as thy pleasure was so thou hast done.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.15'>
And the they toke Ionas and cast hi in to ye se and the se lefte ragynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.16'>
And ye men feared the lorde excedingly: and sacrificed sacrififice vn to the lorde: and vowed vowes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.1.17'>
Bvt ye lorde prepared a greate fyshe to swalow vp Ionas. And so was Ionas in ye bowels of ye fish .iij. dayes and .iij. nightes.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.1'>
And Ionas prayed vnto ye lord his god out of ye bowels of the fish.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.2'>
And he sayde: in my tribulacion I called vn to the lorde and he answered me: out of the bely of hell I cried ad thou herdest my voyce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.3'>
For thou hadest cast me downe depe in the middes of the se: and the floud copased me aboute: and all thy waues and rowles of water wet ouer me:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.4'>
and I thought yt I had bene cast awaye out of thy sight. But I will yet agayne loke towarde thy holy temple.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.5'>
The water copased me eue vn to the very soule of me: the depe laye aboute me: ad the wedes were wrappte aboude myne heed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.6'>
And I wet downe vn to the botome of the hylles and was barred in with erth on euery syde for euer. And yet thou lorde my God broughtest vp my life agayne out of corrupcion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.7'>
When my soule faynted in me I thought on the lorde: and my prayer came in vn to the euen in to thy holy temple.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.8'>
They yt obserue vayne vanities haue forsake him that was mercifull vn to them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.9'>
But I wil sacrifice vn to the with the voce of thankesgeuinge and will paye that I have vowed that sauinge cometh of the lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.2.10'>
And the lorde spake vn to the fish: and it cast out Ionas agayne vppon ye drie lande.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.1'>
Then came the worde of the lorde vn to Ionas agayne sayenge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.2'>
vpp ad gett ye to Niniue that greate citie and preache vn to the the preachynge which I bade ye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.3'>
And he arose and wet to Niniue at ye lordes comaundmet. Niniue was a greate citie vn to god coteynige .iij. dayes iourney
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.4'>
And Ionas went to and entred in to ye citie euen a dayes iourney and cried sayenge: There shall not passe .xl. dayes but Niniue shalbe ouerthrowen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.5'>
And the people of Niniue beleued God and proclaymed fastynge ad arayed them selues in sackcloth as well the greate as the small of them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.6'>
And ye tydinges came vn to the kinge of Niniue which arose out of his sete and did his apparell of and put on sackcloth and sate hi downe in asshes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.7'>
And it was cried ad commaunded in Niniue by ye auctorite of ye kinge ad of his lordes sayenge: se that nether ma or beest oxe or shepe tast ought at al and that they nether fede or drinke water.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.8'>
And they put on sackcloth both man ad beest and cried vn to God mightily ad turned euery man from his weked waye and fro doenge wroge in which they were acustomed sayenge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.9'>
who can tell whether god will turne and repent and cease from his fearce wrathe that we perish not?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.3.10'>
And when god saw theyr workes how they turned from theyr weked wayes he repented on ye euell which he sayd he wold doo vn to them ad dyd it not.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jonah.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.1'>
Wherfore Ionas was sore discontent ad angre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.2'>
And he prayed vn to the lorde ad sayd: O lord was not this my sayenge when I was yet in my contre? And therfore I hasted rather to fle to Tharsis: for I knew well ynough that thou wast a mercifull god ful of copassion long yer thou be angre and of greate mercie and repentest when thou art come to take punishment.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.3'>
Now therfore take my life from me for I had leuer dye then liue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.4'>
And the lorde said vn to Ionas art thou so angrie?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.5'>
And Ionas gatt him out of the citie and sate him downe on the est syde theroffe ad made him there a bothe ad sate thervnder in the shadowe till he might se what shuld chaunce vn to the citie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.6'>
And ye lorde prepared as it were a wild vine which sprage vp ouer Ionas that he might haue shadowe ouer his heed to deliuer him out of his payne. And Ionas was exceadynge glad of the wild vine.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.7'>
And the lorde ordeyned a worme agenst the springe of ye morow mornige which smote the wild vine that it wethered awaye.
</verse>

And assone as the sonne was vpp God prepared a feruent eest winde: so that ye sonne bete ouer the heed of Ionas that he fainted agayne ad wished vn to hys soule that he might dye and sayd it is better for me to dye then to liue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.9'>
And god sayd vn to Ionas art thou so angre for thy wildvine? And he sayde I am angrie a goode even on to the deeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.10'>
And the lorde sayde thou hast compassion on a wild vine wheron thou bestoweddest no laboure ner madest it growe which sprange vp in one night and perished in a nother:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jonah.4.11'>
and shuld not I haue compassion on Niniue that greate citie wherin there is a multitude of people euen aboue an hundred thousande that know not theyr right hand from the lyfte besydes moch catell?
