Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God and brother Timotheus. Vnto the congregacion of God which is at Corinthu with all the saynctes which are in all Achaia.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>
Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>
Blessed be God ye father of oure Lorde Iesus Christ the father of mercy and the God of all comforte
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>
which comforteth vs in all oure tribulacio in so moche yt we are able to coforte them which are troubled in whatsoever tribulacion it be with the same comforte wher with we oure selves are coforted of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>
For as ye affliccios of Christ are pleteous in vs eve so is oure consolacio plenteous by Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>
Whether we be troubled for youre consolacion and salvacio which salvacion sheweth her power in yt ye soffre ye same affliccios which we also suffre: or whether we be coforted for youre consolacion and salvacion:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>
yet oure hope is stedfast for you in as moch as we know how that as ye have youre parte in affliccios so shall ye be parttakers of consolacion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>
Brethren I wolde not have you ignoraut of oure trouble which happened vnto vs in Asia. For we were greved out of measure passynge strength so greatly that we despeared even of lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>
Also we receaved an answer of deeth in oure selves and that because we shuld not put oure trust in oure selves: but in God which rayseth the deed to lyfe agayne
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>
and which delivered vs from so gret a deeth and doth delivre. On whom we trust yt yet hereafter he will deliver
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>
by the helpe of youre prayer for vs: that by the meanes of many occasions thankes maye be geven of many on oure behalfe for the grace geven vnto vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>
Oure reioysynge is this the testimony of oure coscience yt in synglenes and godly purenes and not in flesshly wysdome but by the grace of God we have had oure conuersacion in the worlde and most of all to you wardes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>
We write no nother thinges vnto you then that ye reade and also knowe. Yee and I trust ye shall fynde vs vnto the ende even as ye have founde vs partly:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>
for we are youre reioysynge even as ye are oures in the daye of the Lorde Iesus.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>
And in this confidence was I mynded the other tyme to have come vnto you that ye myght have had yet one pleasure moare:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>
and to have passed by you into Macedonia and to have come agayne out of Macedonia vnto you and to have bene ledde forth to Iewrye warde of you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>
When I thus wyse was mynded: dyd I vse lightnes? Or thinke I carnally those thinges which I thinke? that with me shuld be ye ye and naye naye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>
God is faythfull: For oure preachynge vnto you was not ye and naye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>
For Goddis sonne Iesus Christ which was preached amonge you by vs (that is to saye by me and Silvanus and Timotheus) was not ye and naye: but in him it was ye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>
For all the promyses of God in him are ye: and are in him Amen vnto the lawde of God thorow vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>
For it is God which stablissheth vs and you in Christ and hath annoynted vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>
which hath also sealed vs and hath geven the ernest of the sprete into oure hertes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>
I call God for a recorde vnto my soule that forto faver you with all I came not enymoare vnto Corinthum.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>
Not that we be lordes over youre fayth: but helpers of youre ioye. For by fayth ye stode.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>
But I determened this in my silfe yt I wolde not come agayne to you in hevines.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>
For yf I make you sorye who is it that shuld make me glad but the same which is made sory by me?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>
And I wrote this same pistle vnto you lest yf I came I shuld take hevynes of them of whom I ought to reioyce. Certaynly this confidence have I in you all that my ioye is the ioye of you all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>
For in great affliccion and anguysshe of hert I wrote vnto you with many teares: not to make you sory but that ye myght perceave the love which I have most specially vnto you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>
If eny man hath caused sorow the same hath not made me sory but partely: lest I shuld greve you all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>
It is sufficient vnto the same man that he was rebuked of many.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>
So that now contrary wyse ye ought to forgeve him and comforte him: lest that same persone shuld be swalowed vp with over moche hevines.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>
Wherfore I exhorte you that love maye have stregth over him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>
For this cause verely dyd I write that I myght knowe the profe of you whether ye shuld be obediet in all thinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>
To whom ye forgeve enythinge I forgeve also. And verely if I forgeve enythinge to whom I forgave it for youre sakes forgave I it in the roume of Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>
lest Satan shuld prevet vs. For his thoughtes are not vnknowen vnto vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>
When I was come to Troada for Christes gospels sake (and a great dore was openned vnto me of the Lorde)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>
I had no rest in my sprete because I founde not Titus my brother: but toke my leave of them and went awaye into Macedonia.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>
Thankes be vnto God which alwayes geveth vs the victorie in Christ and openeth the saver of his knowledge by vs in every place.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>
For we are vnto God the swete savoure of Christ both amoge them that are saved and also amoge them which perisshe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>
To the one parte are we ye savoure of deeth vnto deeth. And vnto the other parte are we the savoure of lyfe vnto lyfe. And who is mete vnto these thinges?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>
For we are not as many are which choppe and chaunge with the worde of God: but even oute of purenes and by the power of God and in the sight of God so speake we in Christ.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>
We begyn to prayse oure selves agayne. Nede we as some other of pistles of recommendacion vnto you? or letters of recomendacion from you?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>
Ye are oure pistle written in oure hertes which is vnderstonde and reed of all men
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>
in that ye are knowen how that ye are the pistle of Christ ministred by vs and written not with ynke: but with the sprete of the livynge God not in tables of stone but in flesshly tables of ye herte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>
Suche trust have we thorow Christ to god ward
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>
not that we are sufficient of oure selves to thinke enythinge as it were of oure selves: but oure ablenes cometh of God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>
which hath made vs able to minister the newe testamet not of the letter but of the sprete. For the letter kylleth but the sprete geveth lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>
Yf the ministracion of deeth thorow the letters figured in stones was glorious so yt the chyldren of Israel coulde not beholde the face of Moses for the glory of his countenauce (which glory neverthelesse is done awaye)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>
why shall not the ministracion of the sprete be moche more glorious?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>
For if ye ministringe of condempnacio beglorious: moche more do the the ministracion of rightewesnes excede in glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>
For no dout that which was there glorified is not once glorified in respecte of this excedynge glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>
Then if that which is destroyed was glorious moche more shall that which remayneth be glorious.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>
Seynge then that we have soche trust we vse gret boldnes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>
and do not as Moses which put a vayle over his face that the children of Israel shuld not se for what purpose that served which is put awaye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>
But their myndes were blinded. For untill this daye remayneth the same coveringe vntake awaye in the olde testamet when they reade it which in Christ is put awaye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>
But even vnto this daye when Moses is redde ye vayle hangeth before their hertes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>
Neverthelesse when they tourne to ye Lorde the vayle shalbe taken awaye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>
The Lorde no dout is a sprete. And where the sprete of the Lorde is there is libertie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>
But we all beholde the glorye of the Lorde with his face open and are chaunged vnto the same similitude from glory to glory even of the sprite of the Lorde.

Therfore seinge that we have soche an office eve as mercy is come on vs we faynte not:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>
but have cast from vs the clokes of vnhonestie and walke not in craftines nether corrupte we the worde of God: but walke in open trueth and reporte oure selves to every mannes conscience in the sight of God.
</verse>

Yf oure Gospell be yet hyd it is hid amoge them that are lost

in whom ye god of this worlde hath blynded the myndes of them which beleve not lest the light of ye glorious gospell of Christ which is the ymage of god shuld shyne vnto them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>
For we preache not oure selves but Christ Iesus to be the Lorde and oure selves youre servautes for Iesus sake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>
For it is God that commauded the light to shyne out of darcknes which hath shyned in oure hertes for to geve the light of the knowledge of the glorie of God in the face of Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>
But we have this treasure in erthe vessels that ye excellent power of it myght appere to be of God and not of vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>
We are troubled on every side yet are we not with out shyft. We are in povertie: but not vtterly without somwhat.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>
We are persecuted: but are not forsake. We are cast doune: neverthelesse we perisshe not.

And we all wayes beare in oure bodyes the dyinge of the Lorde Iesus that the lyfe of Iesu myght appere in oure bodyes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>
For we which live are alwayes delyvered vnto deeth for Iesus sake yt the lyfe also of Iesu myght appere in oure mortall flesshe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>
So then deeth worketh in vs and lyfe in you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>
Seynge then yt we have ye same sprete of fayth accordinge as it is writte: I beleved and therfore have I spoken. We also beleve and therfore speake.

        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>
For we knowe that he which raysed vp the Lorde Iesus shall rayse vp vs also by the meanes of Iesus and shall seet vs with you.
</verse>

For all thinges do I for youre sakes that the plenteous grace by thankes geve of many maye redounde to the prayse of god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>
Wherfore we are not weried but though oure vttward man perisshe yet the inwarde man is renewed daye by daye.

For oure excedinge tribulacion which is momentany and light prepareth an excedinge and an eternall wayght of glorye

We knowe suerly yf oure erthy mancion wherin we now dwell were destroyed that we have a bildinge ordeyned of god an habitacion not made with hondes but eternall in heve.

And herefore sigh we desyringe to be clothed wt oure mansion which is from heven:

He that hath ordeyned vs for this thynge ys god which very same hath geven vnto vs the ernest of the sprete.

Neverthelesse we are of good comforte and had lever to be absent from the body and to be present with the lorde.

We prayse not oure selves agayne vnto you but geve you an occasion to reioyce of vs that ye maye have some what agaynst the whych reioyce in the face and not in the hert.
