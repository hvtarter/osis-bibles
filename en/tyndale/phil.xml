because of the fellowshyp which ye have in the gospell from the fyrst daye vnto now:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>
and am suerly certified of this that he which beganne a good worke in you shall go forthe with it vntyll the daye of Iesus Christ

For God beareth me recorde how greatly I longe after you all from the very herte rote in Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>
And this I praye yt youre love maye increace more and more in knowledge and in all fealinge

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>
I wolde ye vnderstode brethern that my busynes is happened vnto the greater furtherynge of the gospell.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>
So that my bondes in Christ are manyfest thorow out all the iudgement hall and in all other places:

In so moche that many of the brethre in ye lorde are boldned thorow my bodes and dare more largely speake the worde with out feare.

Some ther are which preache Christ of envie and stryfe and some of good wyll.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>
The one parte preacheth Christ of stryfe and not purely supposinge to adde more adversitie to my bondes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>
The other parte of love because they se that I am set to defend the gospell.

</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>
For Christ is to me lyfe and deeth is to me a vauntage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>
Yf it chaunce me to live in the flesshe that is to me frutefull forto worke and what to chose I wote not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>
I am constrayned of two thinges: I desyre to be lowsed and to be with Christ which thinge is best of all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>
Neverthelesse to abyde in the flesshe is moare nedfull for you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>
Only let yovre conversacion be as it be cometh the gospell of Christ: that whether I come and se you or els be absent I maye yet heare of you that ye contynue in one sprete and in one soule labouringe as we do to mayntayne the fayth of the gospell
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>
and in nothynge fearinge youre adversaries: which is to them a token of perdicion and to you of salvacion and that of God.
</verse>

If ther be amoge you eny consolacion in Christ yf ther be eny cofortable love yf there be eny fellishippe of the sprete yf ther be eny copassion or mercy:

Let the same mynde be in you that was in Christ Iesu:
</verse>

Which beynge in the shape of god and thought it not robbery to be equall with god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>
Neverthelesse he made him silfe of no reputacion and toke on him the shape of a servaunte and became lyke vnto men
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>
and was founde in his aparell as a man. He humbled him silfe and became obediet vnto ye deeth even the deeth of the crosse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>
Wherfore god hath exalted him and geve him a name above all names:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>
that in the name of Iesus shuld every knee bowe bothe of thinges in heve and thinges in erth and thinges vnder erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>
and that all tonges shuld confesse that Iesus Christ is the lorde vnto the prayse of God the father.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>
Wherfore my dearly beloved as ye have al ways obeyed not when I was present only but now moche more in myne absence even so worke out youre awne saluacio with feare and tremblynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>
For it is god which worketh in you both ye will and also yt dede eve of good will

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>
Do all thynge with out murmurynge and disputynge

that ye maye be fautelesse and pure and the sonnes of God with out rebuke in ye middes of a croked and a perverse nacion amonge which se that ye shyne as lightes in the worlde
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>

</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>
Yee and though I be offered vp vpon the offerynge and sacrifice of youre fayth: I reioyce and reioyce with you all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>
For the same cause also reioyce ye and reioyce ye with me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>
I trust in the lorde Iesus for to sende Timotheus shortly vnto you that I also maye be of good comforte when I knowe what case ye stonde in.

For all other seke ytir awne and not that which is Iesus Christes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>
Ye knowe the proffe of him howe that as a sone with the father so with me bestowed he his labour apon the gospell.

I trust in the lorde I also my silfe shall come shortly.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>
I supposed it necessary to sende brother Epaphroditus vnto you my companion in laboure and felowe soudier youre Apostel and my minister at my nedes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>
For he longed after you and was full of hevines because that ye had hearde saye that he shuld be sicke.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>
And no doute he was sicke and that nye vnto deeth. But god had mercy on him: not on him only but on me also lest I shuld have had sorowe apon sorowe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>
I sent him therfore the diligentliar that when ye shuld se him ye myght reioyce agayne and I myght be the lesse sorowfull.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>
Receave him therfore in the lorde with all gladnes and make moche of soche:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>
because that for ye worke of Christ he went so farre that he was nye vnto deeth and regarded not his lyfe to fulfill that service which was lackynge on youre parte towarde me.

      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>
Morover my brethren reioyce in the lorde. It greveth me not to write one thinge often to you. For to you it is a sure thynge.

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>
Beware of dogges beware of evyll workers. Beware of dissencion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>
For we are circucision which worshippe god in the sprete and reioyce in Christ Iesu and have no confidence in the flesshe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>
though I have wherof I myght reioyce in the flesshe. Yf eny other man thynketh that he hath wherof he myght trust in the flesshe: moche moare I:

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>
and as concernynge fervetnes I perseuted the congregacion and as touchynge the rightewesnes which is in the lawe I was vnrebukable.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>
But the thynges that were vauntage vnto me I counted losse for Christes sake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>
Ye I thinke all thynges but losse for that excellet knowledges sake of Christ Iesu my lorde. For whom I have counted all thynge losse and do iudge them but donge that I myght wynne Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>
and myght be founde in him not havynge myne awne rightewesnes which is of the lawe: But that which spryngeth of the fayth which is in Christ. I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of God thorowe fayth

yf by eny meanes I myght attayne vnto the resurreccion from deeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>
Not as though I had all redy attayned to it Ether were all redy parfect: but I folowe yf yt I maye comprehende that wherin I am comprehended of Christ Iesu.
