Paul Syluanus and Timotheus. Vnto the congregacion of the Tessalonyans which are in God oure father and in the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>
Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>
We are bounde to thanke God all wayes for you brethren as it is mete because that youre fayth groweth excedyngly and every one of you swymmeth in love towarde another betwene youre selves 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>
so yt we oureselves reioyce of you in the congregacions of God over youre pacience and fayth in all youre persecucions and tribulacios that ye suffre 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>
which is a token of ye ryghtewes iudgemet of god that ye are counted worthy of the kyngdom of god for which ye also suffre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>
It is verely a rightewes thinge with God to recopence tribulacion to them that trouble you:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>
and to you which are troubled rest with vs when the lorde Iesus shall shewe him silfe from heven with his myghty angels 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>
in flammynge fyre rendrynge vengeaunce vnto them that knowe not God and to them that obeye not vnto the gospell of oure Lorde Iesus Christ 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>
which shalbe punysshed with everlastynge damnacion from the presence of the lorde and from the glory of his power 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>
when he shall come to be glorified in his sainctes and to be made marvelous in all them that beleve: because oure testimonye that we had vnto you was beleved eve the same daye that we preached it. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>
Wherfore we praye all wayes for you that oure god make you worthy of the callynge and fulfill all delectacion of goodnes and the worke of fayth with power:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>
that the name of oure lorde Iesus Christ maye be gloryfied in you and ye in him thorowe the grace of oure God and of the lorde Iesus Christ. 
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>
We beseche you brethren by the commynge of oure lorde Iesu Christ and in that we shall assemble vnto him 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>
that ye be not sodely moved from youre mynde and be not troubled nether by sprete nether by wordes nor yet by letter which shuld seme to come from vs as though the daye of Christ were at honde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>
Let no ma deceave you by eny meanes for the lorde commeth not excepte ther come a departynge fyrst and that that synfnll man be opened ye sonne of perdicion
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>
which is an adversarie and is exalted above all that is called god or that is worshipped: so that he shall sitt as God in temple of god and shew him silfe as god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>
Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I tolde you these thynges?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>
And nowe ye knowe what with holdeth: even that he myght be vttered at his tyme.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>
For the mistery of that iniquitie doeth he all readie worke which onlie loketh vntill it be taken out of ye waye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>
And then shall that wicked be vttered whom the lorde shall consume with the sprete of hys mouth and shall destroye with the apearaunce of his commynge
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>
even him whose commynge is by the workynge of Satan wyth all lyinge power signes and wonders:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>
and in all deceavablenes of vnrightewesnes amonge them that perysshe: because they receaved not the (love) of the truth that they myght have bene saved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>
And therfore god shall sende them stronge delusion that they shuld beleve lyes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>
that all they myght be damned which beleved not the trueth but had pleasure in vnrightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>
But we are bounde to geve thankes alwaye to god for you brethren beloved of the lorde for because that God hath from the begynnynge chosen you to saluacion thorow sanctifyinge of the sprete and thorowe belevynge the trueth:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>
whervnto he called you byoure gospell to obtayne ye glorye that cometh of oure lord Iesu Christ.
</verse>

not but that we had auctoritie: but to make oure selves an insample vnto you to folowe vs.

        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>
For when we were with you this we warned you of yt yf ther were eny which wolde not worke that ye same shuld not eate.

        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>
We have hearde saye no doute that ther are some which walke amonge you inordinatly and worke not at all but are besy bodies.
