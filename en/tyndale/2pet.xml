        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>
Simon Peter a seruaunt and an Apostle of Iesus Christ to them which have obtayned lyke precious fayth with vs in the rightewesnes that commeth of oure God and savioure Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>
Grace with you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Iesus oure Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>
Accordinge as his godly power hath geven vnto vs all thinges that pertayne vnto lyfe and godlynes thorow the knowledge of him that hath called vs by vertue and glory
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>
by the meanes whereof are geven vnto vs excellent and moste greate promises that by the helpe of them ye shuld be partakers of the godly nature in that ye flye the corrupcion of worldy lust.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>
And hervnto geve all diligence: in youre fayth minister vertve and in vertue knowledge
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>
and in knowledge temperancy and in temrancy pacience in pacience godlynes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>
in godlynes brotherly kyndnes in brotherly kyndnes love.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>
For yf these thinges be amonge you and are plenteous they wyll make you that ye nether shalbe ydle nor vnfrutefull in the knowledge of oure lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>
But he yt lacketh these thynges is blynde and gropeth for ye waye with his honde and hath forgotten yt he was pourged from his olde synnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>
Wherfore brethren geve the moare diligence forto make youre callynge and eleccion sure. For yf ye do soche thynges ye shall never erre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>
Ye and by this meanes an entrynge in shall be ministred vnto you aboundantly in to the everlastynge kyngdome of oure lorde and saveoure Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>
Wherfore I will not be necgligent to put you allwayes in remembraunce of soche thinges though that ye knowe them youre selves and be also stablisshed in the present trueth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>
Notwithstodinge I thynke yt mete (as longe as I am in this tabernacle) to stere you vp by puttynge you in remebraunce
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>
for as moch as I am sure howe that the tyme is at honde yt I must put of my tabernacle even as oure lorde Iesus Christ hath shewed me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>
I will enfource therfore that on every syde ye myght have wherwith to stere vp the remembraunce of these thynges after my departynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>
For we folowed not decevable fables whe we openned vnto you the power and commynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ but with oure eyes we sawe his maieste:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>
even then verely when he receaved of god the father honour and glory and when ther came soche a voyce to him from excellent glorie. This is my dere beloved sonne in whom I have delite.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>
This voyce we hearde when it came from heven beynge with him in the holy mounte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>
We have also a right sure worde of prophesye wher vnto yf ye take hede as vnto a lyght yt shyneth in a darke place ye do wel vntill the daye dawne and the daye starre aryse in youre hertes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>
So that ye fyrst knowe this. that no prophesye in the scripture hath eny private interpretacio.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>
For the scripture came never by the will of man: but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy goost.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>
Ther were falce prophetes amonge the people even as ther shalbe falce teachers amonge you: wich prevely shall brynge in damnable sectes even denyinge the Lorde that hath bought them and brynge vpon them selves swyft damnacion
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>
and many shall folowe their damnable wayes by which the waye of trueth shalbe evyll spoken of
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>
and thorow coveteousnes shall they with fayned wordes make marchandyse of you whose iudgement is not farre of and their dampnacion slepeth not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>
For yf god spared not the angels that synned but cast them doune into hell and delyuered them in chaynes of darknes to be kept vnto iudgement.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>
Nether spared the olde worlde but saved Noe the ryghte preacher of rightewesnes and brought in the flud vpon the worlde of the vngodly
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>
and turned the cities of zodom and Gomor into asshes: overthrewe them damned the and made on them an ensample vnto all yt after shuld live vngodly.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>
And iust Lot vexed with the vnclenly conversacio of the wicked delivered he.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>
For he beynge ryghteous and dwellynge amonge them in seynge and hearynge vexed his righteous soule from daye to daye with their vnlawfull dedes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>
The lorde knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptacion and how to reserve the vniuste vnto the daye of iudgement for to be punisshed:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>
namely them that walke after the flesshe in the lust of vnclennes and despyse the rulars. Presumpteous are they and stubborne and feare not to speake evyll of them that are in auctorite.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>
When ye angels which are greater bothe in power and myght receave not of ye lorde raylynge iudgement agaynst them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>
But these as brute beastes naturally made to betaken and destroyed speake evyll of that they knowe not and shall perisshe through their awne destruccion
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>
and receave the rewarde of vnrightewesnes.They count it pleasure to live deliciously for a season. Spottes they are and filthines livinge at pleasure and in disceaveable wayes feastynge with you:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>
havinge eyes full of advoutrie and that canot cease to synne begylynge vnstable soules. Hertes they have exercised wt coveteousnes. They are cursed chyldren
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>
and have forsaken the right waye and are gone astraye folowinge ye waye of Balam the sonne of Bosor which loved the rewarde of vnrightewesnes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>
but was rebuked of his iniquitie. The tame and dome beast speakinge with manes voyce forbade the folisshnes of the Prophete.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>
These are welles without water and cloudes caried about of a tepest to whome the myst of darcknes is reserved for ever.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>
For when they have spoke the swellinge wordes of vanytie they begyle wt wantanes thorowe yt lustes of the flesshe them that were clene escaped: but now are wrapped in errours.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>
They promys them libertye and are them selves ye bonde servauntes of corrupcion. For of whom soever a man is over come vnto ye same is he in bondage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>
For yf they after they have escaped from the filthynes of the worlde thorowe ye knowledge of ye Lorde and of ye saviour Iesus Christ they are yet tagled agayne therin and overcome: then is ye latter ende worsse with them then the beginninge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>
For it had bene better for the not to have knowne ye waye of righteousnes then after they have knowe it to turne fro the holy comaundmet geve vnto them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>
It is happened vnto them accordinge to the true proverbe: The dogge is turned to his vomet agayne and the sow that was wesshed to her wallowynge in the myre.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>
This is the seconde pistle that I now wryte vnto you beloved wherwith I stere vp and warne youre pure myndes to call to remembrauce
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>
the wordes which were tolde before of the holy prophetes and also the commaundement of vs the apostles of the lorde and saveour.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>
This fyrst vnderstode that ther shall come in the last dayes mockers which will walke after their awne lustes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>
and saye. Where is the promes of his comynge? For sence ye fathers dyed all thinges cotinue in ye same estate wher in they were at ye begynninge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>
This they knowe not (and that willyngly) how that the hevens a great whyle ago were and the erth that was in the water appered vp out of the water by the worde of god:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>
by the which thinges the worlde yt then was perisshed over flowen wt the water.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>
But the heves verely and erth which are now are kept by the same worde in store and reserved vnto fyre agaynst the daye of iudgement and perdicion of vngodly men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>
Derely beloved be not ignorant of this one thynge how that one daye is wt the lorde as a thousande yeare and a thousand yeare as one daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>
The lorde is not slacke to fulfill his promes as some men cout slacknes: but is pacient to vs warde and wolde have no man lost but wolde receave all men to repentauce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>
Neverthelesse ye daye of the lorde will come as a thefe in ye nyght in the which daye ye hevens shall perisshe with terrible noyes and the elemetes shall melt with heet and the erth with the workes that are therin shall burne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>
Yf all these thinges shall perisshe what maner persons ought ye to be in holy conversacion and godlynes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>
lokynge for and hastynge vnto the commynge of the daye of God in which the hevens shall perisshe with fyre and the elementes shalbe consumed with heate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>
Neverthelesse we loke for a newe heven and a newe erth accordynge to his promes where in dwelleth rightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>
Wherfore derly beloved seynge yt ye loke for soche thynges be diliget that ye maye be founde of him in peace wt out spotte and vndefiled
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>
And suppose that ye longe sufferynge of the lorde is saluacion even as oure derely beloved brother Paul accordynge to ye wysdome geve vnto him wrote to you
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>
yee almost in very pistle speakynge of soche thynges: amoge which are many thynges harde to be vnderstonde which they that are vnlearned and vnstable pervert as they do other scriptures vnto their awne destruccio.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>
Ye therfore beloved seynge ye knowe it before hande beware lest ye be also plucked a waye with the erroure of the wicked and fall from youre awne stedfastnes:
