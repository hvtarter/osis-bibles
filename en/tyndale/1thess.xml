Paul  Syluanus and Timotheus. Vnto the congregacion of the Tessalonyans  in God the father  and in ye Lorde Iesus Christ.Grace be with you  and peace from God oure father  and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>
We geve God thakes all waye for you all  makinge mension of you in oure prayers
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>
with out  ceasynge  and call to remembraunce youre worke in the faythe  and labour in love and perseveraunce in the hope of oure lorde Iesus Christ in the sight of God oure father:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>
because we knowe brethren beloved of god  how yt ye are electe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>
For oure gospell came not vnto you in worde only  but also in power  and also in the holy gost and in moche certayntie  as ye knowe after what maner we behaued oure selves amonge you  for youre sakes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>
And ye became folowers of vs and of the lord  and receaved the worde in moche affliccion  with ioye of the holy gost:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>
so that ye were an ensample to all that beleve in Macedonia and Achaia.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>
For from you sounded out the worde of the lorde  not in Macedonia and in Achaia only: but youre fayth also which ye have vnto god  spred her silfe abroade in all quartars  so greatly that it nedeth not vs to speake eny thynge at all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>
For they the selves shewe of you what maner of entrynge in we had vnto you and how ye tourned to God from ymages  for to serve the livynge and true god 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>
and for to loke for his sonne from heven  whom he raysed from deeth: I mean Iesus which delivereth vs from wrath to come. 
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>
For ye youre selves knowe brethren of oure entraunce in vnto you  howe that it was not in vayne:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>
but even after that we had suffered before and were shamfully entreated at Phillippos (as ye well knowe) then were we bolde in oure God to speake  vnto you the gospell of God  with moche strivynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>
Oure exhortacion was not to brynge you to erroure  nor yet to vnclennes  nether was it with gyle:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>
but as we were alowed of God  that the gospell shuld be comitted vnto vs: even so we speake  not as though we entended to please men  but God  which trieth oure hertes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>
Nether was oure conversacion at eny tyme wt flatterynge wordes  as ye well knowe nether in cloked coveteousnes  God is recorde:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>
nether sought we prayse of men  nether of you  nor yet of eny other  when we myght have bene chargeable  as the apostles of Christ
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>
but we were tender amonge you  even as a norsse cheressheth her children 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>
so was oure affeccion towarde you  oure good will was to have dealte vnto you  not the gospell of God only: but also oure awne soules  because ye were deare vnto vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>
Ye remember brethre oure laboure and travayle.     For we laboured daye and nyght  because we wolde not be greveous vnto eny of you  and preached vnto you ye gospell of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>
Ye are witnesses     and so is god  how holyly and iustly and vnblameable we behaved oure selves amonge you that beleve:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>
as ye knowe how that we exhorted and comforted and besought every one of you  as a father his childre
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>
that ye wolde walke worthy of God  which hath called you vnto his kyngdome and glory.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>
For this cause thanke we god with out ceasynge  because that when ye receaved of vs  the worde wherwith God was preached  ye receaved it not as the worde of man: but even as it was in dede  the worde of God  which worketh in you that beleve.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>
For ye brethre became folowers of the congregacions of god which in Iewry are in Christ Iesu: for ye have suffered lyke thynges of youre kynsmen as we oure selves have suffered of the Iewes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>
Which as they kylled the lorde Iesus and their awne prophetes  even so have they persecuted vs  and God they please not  and are contrary to all men
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>
and forbid vs to preache vnto the gentyls  that they myght be saved  to fulfill their synnes all waye. For the wrath of God is come on them  even to the vtmost.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>
For as moch brethren as we are kept from you for a season  as concernynge the bodyly presence  but not in the herte  we enforsed the more to se you personally with great desire.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>
And therfore we wolde have come vnto you  I paul once and agayne: but Satan with stode vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>
For what is oure hope or ioye  or croune of reioysynge? are not ye it in the presence of oure lorde Iesus Christ at his comynge?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>
yes ye are oure glory and ioye. 
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>
Wherfore sence we coulde no lenger forbeare  it pleased vs to remayne at Athens alone  
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>
and sent Timotheus oure brother and minister of god  and oure laboure felowe in the gospell of Christ  to stablysshe you and to coforte you over youre fayth 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>
yt no ma shulde be moved in these affliccios. For ye youre selves knowe that we are even apoynted therevnto.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>
For verely when I was with you  I tolde you before that we shulde suffre tribulacion  even as it came to passe  and as ye knowe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>
For this cause  when I coulde no lenger forbeare  I sent  that I myght have knowledge of youre fayth  lest haply the tempter had tempted you  and that oure laboure had bene bestowed in vayne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>
But now lately whe Timotheus came fro you vnto vs  and declared to vs youre fayth and youre love and how that ye have good remembraunce of vs all wayes  desyringe to se vs as we desyre to se you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>
Therfore brethre we had consolacion in you  in all oure adversite and necessite  through youre fayth.

Further more we beseche you brethren  and exhorte you in the lorde Iesus  that ye increace more and more  euen as ye have receaved of vs how ye ought to walke and to please god.

Ye remember what commaundmetes we gave you in oure lorde Iesu Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>
For this is the will of god  even that ye shuld be holy  and that ye shuld abstayne from fornicacion 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>
that every one of you shuld knowe how to kepe his vessell in holynes and honoure 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>
and not in the lust of concupiscence  as do the hethen which knowe not god 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>
that no man goo to farre and defraude his brother in bargayninge: because the lorde is a venger of all suche thinges as we tolde you before tyme and testified.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>
For god hath not called vs vnto vnclennes: but vnto holynes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>
He therfore that despiseth  despiseth not man  but God  which hath sent his holy sprete amonge you.

But as touchynge brotherly love  ye nede not that I wryte vnto you. For ye are taught of God to love on another.
