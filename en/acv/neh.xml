      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. Also the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates of it are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days. And I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I beseech thee, O LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou may hearken to the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the sons</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commanded thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commanded thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the outermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou have redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name, and, I pray thee, prosper thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>Now I was cupbearer to the king. And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not [formerly] been sad in</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said to the king, Let the king live forever. Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lays waste, and the gates of it are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, For what do thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be? And when will thou return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given to me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come to Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there came a man to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me. I neither told any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem, nor was there any beast with me except the beast that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates of it were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool, but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall. And I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers did not know where I went, or what I did, neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the ranking men, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them, Ye see the evil condition that we are in, how Jerusalem lays waste, and the gates of it are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us. Therefore we his servants will arise and build, but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate. They sanctified it, and set up the doors of it, even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rub</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox goes up he shall break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God, for we are despised, and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>and do not cover their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half [the height] of it, for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and all of them together conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens has become feeble, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass that, when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where ye shall return to us they will be upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore I set in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said to the ranking men, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember LORD, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every man to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They all built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves, every man with one of his hands labored in the work, and with the other held his weapon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>and the builders, every man had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the ranking men, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In whatever place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, gather ye there to us, our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we labored in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let each with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were who said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were some also who said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain because of the dearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also who said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons as their sons. And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]. Neither is it in our</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the ranking men and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, everyone of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations, and would ye even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they were silent, and found not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>And I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them, so will we do, even as thou say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, who does not perform this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised LORD. And th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bre</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors who were before me charged the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the bon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though even to that time I had not s</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it, and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand</verse>
