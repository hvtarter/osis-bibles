      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the good-news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>It came to pass, that John was immersing in the wilderness and preaching an immersion of repentance for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the land of Judea and the Jerusalemites went out to him, and they were all immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and eating locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying, A man mightier than I comes after me of whom I am not worthy, having stooped down, to loosen the strap of his shoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed immersed you in water, but he will immerse you in Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And straightaway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens divided, and the Spirit descending upon him as a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice occurred out of the heavens, Thou are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And straightaway the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts. And the heavenly agents served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the good-news of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent ye, and believe in the good-news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And walking beside the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, the son of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, Come ye behind me, and I will make you to become fishermen of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And straightaway they left the nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And having advanced a little from there he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And straightaway he called them. And having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen, they went behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they entered into Capernaum, and straightaway on the Sabbath day, having entered into the synagogue, he taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scholars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And a man was in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, Oh no! What is with us and with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Did thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou are, the Holy man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be thou muzzled, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, having convulsed him and having cried in a great voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What is this new doctrine, that he commands with authority, and the unclean spirits also obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And his fame went forth straightaway into the entire region around Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And straightaway, when they came forth out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>But Simon's mother-in-law lay feverish, and straightaway they tell him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And upon coming, having taken hold of her hand, he raised her up and the fever left her. And straightaway she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And having become evening when the sun set they brought to him all who were faring badly, and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together near the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many who were faring badly with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he did not allow the demons to speak, because they had recognized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And having risen early, very much in the night, he came out and departed into a desolate place, and prayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those with him searched for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And having found him, they say to him, All are seeking thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he says to them, Let us go into the nearby towns, so that I may preach there also. For I came forth for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was preaching in their synagogues in all Galilee, and casting out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper comes to him beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou will thou can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, having felt compassion, having reached out his hand, he touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And after he spoke, straightaway the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having strictly warned him, straightaway he sent him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And he says to him, See thou say nothing to any man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and bring for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But having gone out, he began to proclaim it much, and to spread abroad the matter, so as for him to no longer be able to enter openly into a city, but was outside in desolate places. And they came to him from all directions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And having again entered into Capernaum, after some days it was heard that he was in a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And straightaway many were gathered together, so as to accommodate no more, not even near the door. And he spoke the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come bringing to him a paralyzed man, being taken by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to come near to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralyzed man lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And having seen their faith, Jesus says to the paralyzed man, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But some of the scholars were sitting there, and deliberating in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this man speak blasphemies this way. Who can forgive sins but one, God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And straightaway Jesus, having perceived in his spirit that they so deliberated within themselves, said to them, Why do ye deliberate these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he says to the paralyzed man),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go to thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And straightaway he arose, and having taken up the bed, he went forth before them all, so as for all to be amazed, and to glorify God, saying, We never saw it like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And he says to him, Follow thou me. And having risen, he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, while he was dining in his house, that many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scholars of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it he says to them, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those faring badly. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners for repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but the disciples with you do not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, The sons of the wedding hall cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them. As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will they fast in those day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>And no man sews a new patch of cloth on an old garment, otherwise the patch of it pulls away, the new from the old, and a tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass, that he was passing through the grain fields on the Sabbath day, and his disciples began to make a path while plucking the ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, Did ye never read what David did when he had need, and was hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he entered into the house of God under Abiathar the high priest, and ate the loaves of the presentation, which is not permitted to eat except for the priests. And he also gave to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, The Sabbath came into being for sake of man, and not man for sake of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So then the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says to the man who had a withered hand, Stand up in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says to them, Is it permitted to do good on the Sabbath day or to do harm, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And having looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the callousness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees having gone out, they straightaway were making a plot with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>And from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard how many things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat would stay by him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he healed many, so as to press upon him, so that as many as had afflictions might touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he chided them much that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up onto the mountain, and calls in those whom he himself wanted, and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve men, so that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he added to Simon the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he added to them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they come to a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And the multitude comes together again, so as for them, no, not even to be able to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when those with him heard it, they went out to grasp him, for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scholars who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having summoned them, he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no man, having enter into the house of the strong man, can plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he may plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Truly I say to you, that all the sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies, as many as they may blaspheme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness, into the age, but is deserving of eternal damnation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then his brothers and mother come, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a multitude was sitting around him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brothers, and thy sisters, outside seek for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And having looked around at those who sat about him, he says, Behold, my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to him, so as for him, after entering into the boat, to sit on the sea, and all the multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Listen. Behold, the man who sows went forth to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it came to pass during the sowing, some fell by the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And others fell on the rocky ground where it had not much soil. And straightaway it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>And when the sun was risen it was scorched, and because it had no root it dried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it gave no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And others fell into the good ground and gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and brought forth, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he became alone, those around him, with the twelve, asked him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, To you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those outside, all things occur in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>So that seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest they should turn, and the sins would be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? And how will ye understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The man who sows sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are those by the path where the word is sown. And whenever they may hear, straightaway Satan comes, and takes away the word that has been sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these in like manner are those being sown upon the rocky places, who, whenever they may hear the word, straightaway receive it with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway they are caused to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are those being sown in the thorns, who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, and the cravings about other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are those that were sown upon the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, Does the lamp come so that it might be put under the bushel or under the bed? Is it not so that it might be put on the lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is not anything hid, except that it may be revealed, nor become secret, but that it may come to be visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, Watch what ye hear. By what measure ye measure, it will be measured to you, and to those who hear, it will be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, to him it will be given. And he who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and lengthen, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth bears fruit spontaneously, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit yields, straightaway he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of the mustard plant, which, when it is sown in the ground, is smaller than all the seeds upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>Yet when it is sown, it goes up and becomes greater than all the plants, and it makes great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under the shade of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And he did not speak to them apart from a parable, but privately he explained all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And on that day, having become evening, he says to them, Let us pass through to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And having sent the multitude away, they bring him along as he was in the boat. And other small boats were also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And a great storm of wind develops, and the waves were thrown into the boat, so as for it now to be filling.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he came out of the boat, straightaway there met him out of the sepulchers a man with an unclean spirit who had his habitation among the sepulchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>And no man was able to bind him, not even with chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Because he was often bound with shackles and chains, and the chains were pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces. And no man had strength to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, in the mountains and in the sepulchers, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And having cried out in a great voice, he said, What is with me and with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he demanded him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, because we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send them outside of the territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was near the mountain a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, so that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And straightaway, Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits having come out, entered into the swine. And the herd stampeded down the slope into the sea, and were drowned in the sea. And there were about two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And those who fed the swine fled, and reported in the city and in the fields. And they came to see what it was that happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they come to Jesus, and see the man who was demon-possessed, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind (the man who had the legion), and they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg him to depart from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he entered into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed besought him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus did not allow him, but says to him, Go to thy house to thy men, and report to them how much the Lord has done for thee, and was merciful to thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to him, and he was near the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And behold, one of the synagogue rulers comes, Jairus by name. And having seen him, he falls at his feet,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>when she heard about Jesus, having come in the crowd from behind, she touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I but touch his garments, I will be healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked around to see the woman who did this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what has happened to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee. Go in peace, and be healthy from thy scourge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he still spoke, they come from the synagogue ruler saying, Thy daughter died, why still trouble the teacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But straightaway, Jesus, having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he allowed no man to accompany him except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And he comes to the house of the synagogue ruler, and sees a commotion, much weeping and wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he entered in, he says to them, Why do ye make a commotion, and weep? The child did not die, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, takes the father of the child and the mother and those with him, and enters in where the child was laying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And having taken the child's hand, he says to her, Talitha cumi. Which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And straightaway the little girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed with a great amazement.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Thou may neither go into the village, nor may tell any man in the village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he questioned his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>And they answered, saying, John the immerser, and others, Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>And he said to them, Truly I say to you, there are some of those who have stood here, who will, no, not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>And after six days Jesus takes Peter and James and John, and leads them up onto a high mountain alone, in private. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And having responded, Peter says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And we could make three tabernacles: one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>For he knew not what he would say, for they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud developed overshadowing them. And a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly having looked around, they saw no man anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no man what they saw, except when the Son of man will rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they kept the saying to themselves, discussing what is the rising from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they questioned him, saying, The scholars say that Elijah must first come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And having answered, he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first and restores all. And how it is written for the Son of man, that he would suffer many things and be rejected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I say to you, that Elijah has also come, and they did to him as much as they wanted, just as it is written for him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he questioned the scholars, What are ye disputing with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And having answered, one from the multitude said, Teacher, I brought my son to thee, who has a mute spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>And wherever it seizes him, it tears him, and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and becomes limp. And I spoke to thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>And having answered him, he says, O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, straightaway the spirit convulsed him. And having fallen on the ground, he wallowed, foaming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And he questioned his father, How much time is it since this has happened to him? And he said, From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And it often casts him both into the fire and into the waters so that it might destroy him. But if thou can do anything, help us, having compassion toward us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>And Jesus said to him, If thou are able to believe, all things are possible to him who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>And straightaway the father of the child having cried out, he said with tears, I believe. Lord, help thou my unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>And when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Thou mute and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and enter into him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And having cried out, and having convulsed him much, it came out. And he became as if dead, so as for many to said that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But having taken him by the hand, Jesus lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And when he came into the house, his disciples questioned him privately, We were not able to cast it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And having departed from there, they passed through Galilee, and he did not want that any man would know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And after being killed, he will rise the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>And he came to Capernaum. And having become in the house he questioned them, What were ye deliberating among yourselves on the way?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And having sat down, he called the twelve, and he says to them, If any man wants to be first, he will be last of all, and helper of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And having taken a child, he set it in the midst of them. And after embracing it, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>Whoever may receive one of such children in my name, receives me, and whoever may receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain man, who does not follow us, casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no man who will do a mighty work in my name, and will be able quickly to speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For he who is not against you is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For whoever may give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye are of Christ, truly I say to you, he will, no, not lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>And whoever may cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is good for him instead, if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life maimed, than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled, than having thy two feet to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble, pluck it out. It is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>For every man will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt material.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>The salt material is good, but if the salt material becomes saltless, by what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace among each other.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set up a hedge, and dug a winevat, and built a tower, and leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent forth a bondman to the farmers, so that he might receive by the farmers from the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And having seized him, they beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent another bondman to them. And that man, having stoned, they wounded in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And again he sent another, and that man they killed, and many others, beating some, and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore, still having his one beloved son, he also sent him to them, last, saying, They will be made ashamed by my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And having taken him, they killed him, and cast him outside of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>And have ye not read this scripture: The stone that those who build rejected, this came to be into the head of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This happened from Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to seize him. And they feared the multitude, for they knew that he spoke the parable against them. And having left him, they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>And they send some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, so that they might catch him in talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And when they came, they say to him, Teacher, we have seen that thou are true, and it is not a care to thee about any man, for thou look not to a personage of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to give tribute</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we give, or should we not give? But Jesus, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do ye test me? Bring me a denarius, so that I may see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought it. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they marveled at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>And Sadducees come to him, who say there is no resurrection. And they questioned him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves behind a wife, and leaves no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died, neither did he leave seed behind, and the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Are ye not led astray because of this: not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as agents in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But about the dead, that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him at the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of the dead, but God of the living. Ye therefore are much misled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scholars having come, having heard them disputing, knowing that he had answered them well, he questioned him, Which is the first commandment of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, thou Israel, Lord our God is one Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shall love Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole mind, and from thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And this second is similar, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scholar said to him, Well, teacher. Thou spoke in truth that he is one, and there is no other but he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love him from the whole heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole soul, and from the whole strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And when Jesus saw him, that he answered wisely, he said to him, Thou are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man dared to question him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And having responded as he taught in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scholars say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by Holy Spirit, The Lord says to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I may place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David himself therefore calls him Lord, and in what way is he his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his teaching he said to them, Look away from the scholars, those who desire to go about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>those who devour widows' houses, and praying long in pretence. These will receive greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And having sat down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the multitude cast money into the treasury, and many rich men cast in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And one poor widow having come, she cast in two mites, which are a quadrans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And having summoned his disciples, he says to them, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all cast in from that which is abundant to them, but she from her need cast in all, as many things she had, her whole living.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>And Jesus having answered, he said to him, See thou these great buildings? There will be left, no, not a stone upon a stone, that will, no, not be brought down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew questioned him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>Tell us, when will these things be? And what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And having answered them, Jesus began to say to them, Watch that not any man lead you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>For many will come in my name, saying, I am, and they will lead many astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>And when ye may hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not alarmed, for it must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginnings of travails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But watch ye yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and ye will be beaten in synagogues. And ye will be stood before rulers and kings because of me, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>And the good-news must first be preached to all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>But when they lead you, delivering you up, be not anxious before what ye might speak, nor meditate. But whatever may be given you in that hour, speak ye this, for ye are not who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>And brother will betray brother to death, and a father a child. And children will rise up against parents, and will condemn them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>And ye will be hated by all men because of my name, but he who endures to the end, this man will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>But when ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.15'>and let the man on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter in to take anything out of his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.16'>and let the man who is in the field not turn back for the things behind, to take his cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.17'>But woe to those who have in the womb, and to those who suckle in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.18'>And pray ye that your flight may not be in winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.19'>For those days will be tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and no, will not happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.20'>And unless the Lord cut short the days, no flesh would have been saved, but because of the chosen, whom he chose, he cut short the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.21'>And then if any man should say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Lo, there, do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.22'>For FALSE Christs and FALSE prophets will arise, and will give signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.23'>But watch ye. Behold, I have foretold all to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.24'>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.26'>And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.27'>And then he will send forth his heavenly agents, and will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the outermost part of the earth as far as the outermost part of heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>Now after two days was the Passover and the unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scholars sought how, having take him with trickery, they might kill him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat relaxing, a woman came having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure spikenard, very valuable. And having broken the alabaster cruse, she poured it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>And some were indignant within themselves, saying, Why has this waste of the ointment happened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For this could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they grumbled at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, Leave her be. Why do ye cause troubles for her? She performed a good work on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>For ye always have the poor with you, and whenever ye may desire ye can do them well, but ye do not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She applied what she had to anoint my body. She did it beforehand for the burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>And truly I say to you, wherever this good-news may be preached in the whole world, also what she did will be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do thou want, after going, we should prepare that thou may eat the Passover?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>And they threw their hands on him, and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>And a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>And not even this way was their testimony consistent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest having stood up in the midst, he demanded Jesus, saying, Thou answer nothing? What is it these men testify against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest demanded him, and says to him, Are thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, I am. And ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>And the high priest having torn his clothes, he says, What further need have we of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Ye have heard the blasphemy. What does it seem to you? And they all condemned him to be deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with a fist, and to say to him, Prophesy. And the subordinates were throwing him with slaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And having seen Peter warming himself, having looked at him, she says, Thou also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know not, nor understand what thou say. And he went outside onto the porch, and a cock sounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the servant girl having seen him, she began again to say to those who stood by, This man is from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, Surely thou are from them, for thou are a Galilean, and thy accent is similar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time a cock sounded. And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds twice, thou will deny me thrice. And having broke down, he wept.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And straightaway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scholars and the whole council, having made a plan, after binding Jesus, they took him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate questioned him, Are thou the king of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate again questioned him, saying, Thou answer nothing? Behold how many things they testify against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus answered nothing any more, so as for Pilate to wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now during a feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And a man who was called Barabbas was with the rebels who were bound, men who had committed murder during the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And having cried aloud, the multitude began to ask as he was always doing for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>And Pilate answered them, saying, Do ye wish that I would release to you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests incited the crowd, so that he would release Barabbas to them instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And again having answered, Pilate said to them, What then do ye wish I would do to the man whom ye call the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And Pilate, wanting to do what was sufficent for the crowd, released Barabbas to them. And he delivered Jesus, after scourging, so that he might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away inside the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they put purple clothing on him, and clothe him with a woven crown of thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and began to salute him, Hail, king of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple garment off of him, and dressed him with his own garments. And they lead him out so that they might crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they draft a certain Simon, a Cyrenian passing by coming from the countryside, the father of Alexander and Rufus, so that he would take his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots for them, who would take what.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And they crucify two robbers with him, one at his right hand, and one at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was reckoned with lawless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by railed at him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save thyself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking among each other with the scholars said, He saved others, he cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe in him. And those who were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And having become the sixth hour, darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one having ran, and having filled a sponge of vinegar, and having placed it on a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Leave be. We might see if Elijah comes to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And having given out a great voice, Jesus expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the curtain of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion, who stood from opposite him, saw that he expired, having cried out this way, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the small man, and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>women who also followed him and served him when he was in Galilee, also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now having become evening, since it was the Preparation, that is, pre-Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea came, an honorable councilman who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, emboldened, he went in near Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if he died already. And having summoned the centurion, he questioned him if he was already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And having ascertained from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And having bought fine linen, and having taken him down, he wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher, being that which had been hewn out of rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that having come, they might anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very much early morning on the first day of the week, they come near to the sepulcher when the sun was risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said to themselves, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulcher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And having looked, they see that the stone has been rolled back, for it was very large.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And having entered into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the man of Nazareth who was crucified. He was raised. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee. Ye will see him there, just as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And having come out, they fled from the sepulcher, and trembling and astonishment seized them. And they said nothing to any man, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now having risen early morning on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>That woman, having gone, informed those who became with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those men, when they heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>And after these things he appeared in a different form to two of them as they walked going into the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And those men having departed, they reported to the others. Neither did they believe those men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he became visible to them, to the eleven, who were relaxing. And he upbraided their unbelief and hard heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he was raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, Having gone into all the world, preach ye the good-news to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is immersed will be saved, but he who does not believe will be damned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They will take up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it will, no, not harm them. They will lay hands on the feeble, and they will fare well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>Therefore indeed, the Lord, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And those men, having gone forth, they preached everywhere, the Lord working jointly, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Truly.</verse>
