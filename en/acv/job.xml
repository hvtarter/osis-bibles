      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household, so that this man was the greatest of all the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day, and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were completed, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my so</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before LORD, that Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And LORD said to Satan, From where do thou come? Then Satan answered LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And LORD said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Have thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? Thou have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy power, only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away. Yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God fell from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. LORD gave, and LORD has taken away, blessed be the name of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin, nor foolishly accuse God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before LORD, that Satan came also among them to present himself before LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And LORD said to Satan, From where did thou come? And Satan answered LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And LORD said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although thou m</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand, only spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of LORD, and smote Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd for him to scrape himself with it, and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said to him, Do thou still hold fast thine integrity? Renounce God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, Thou speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came each one from his own place--Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite--and they made an appointment together to come t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice, and wept. And each one tore his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. And none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness. Let not God from above seek for it, nor let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell upon it. Let blackness come upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, nor let it behold the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built waste places for themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or I should have been as a hidden untimely birth, as infants that never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together. They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there. And the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I fear comes upon me, and that which I am afraid of comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, neither have I rest, but trouble comes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If a man tries to converse with thee, will thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou have instructed many, and thou have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upheld him who was falling, and thou have made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it comes to thee, and thou faint. It touches thee, and thou are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>According as I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes. [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants, and he charges his [heavenly] agents with folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now, is there any who will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones will thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation kills the foolish man, and jealousy slays the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His sons are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>whose harvest the hungry eat up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapes for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring out of the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me, I would seek to God. And to God I would commit my cause,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>who gives rain upon the earth, and sends waters upon the fields,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>so that he sets up on high those who are low, and those who mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So a poor man has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise thou the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he injures, and binds up. He wounds, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver thee in six troubles. Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue. Neither shall thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and dearth thou shall laugh, nor shall thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For thou shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shall know that thy tent is in peace, and thou shall visit thy fold, and shall miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>O that my grief were but weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas. Therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison of which my spirit drinks up. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or the ox moo over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which has no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuses to touch [them]. They are as loathsome food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>O that I might have my request, and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>And be it still my consolation, yea, let me exult (in pain that does not spare), that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength that I should wait? And what is my end that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is it not that I have no help in me, and that wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him who is ready to faint, kindness [should be] from his friend, even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>which are black because of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they grow warm, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside. They go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because they had hoped. They came there, and were confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now ye are nothing. Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Give to me? Or, Offer a present for me from your substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will be quiet. And cause me to understand how I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye think to reprove words, seeing that the speeches of a man who is desperate are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye would cast [lots] upon the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be pleased to look upon me, for truly I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice. Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, and as a hireling who looks for his wages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>so I am made to possess months of misery, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro to the dawning of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>O remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>The eye of him who sees me shall behold me no more. Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.10'>He shall return no more to his house, nor shall his place know him any more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm upon him. They cannot be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>His heart is as firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.25'>When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid. Because of consternation they are beside themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.26'>If a man lays at him with the sword it cannot avail, nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.27'>He counts iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow cannot make him flee. Sling-stones are turned into stubble with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds. He spreads out [as] a threshing-wagon upon the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He makes a path to shine after him. [A man] would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.33'>Upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.34'>He beholds everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered LORD, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou can do all things, and that no purpose of thine can be restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak, I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that, after LORD had spoken these words to Job, LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends. For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Jo</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams. And go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for him I will accept, that I not deal with you after your fol</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as LORD commanded them, and LORD accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And LORD turned [back] the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. And LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that LORD ha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah, and the name of the second, Keziah, and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.</verse>
