      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and co-workman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to the beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the congregation at thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making recollection of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of thy love and faith, which thou have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the sanctified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>so that the fellowship of thy faith may become potent (in the knowledge of every good thing in us) for Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have much joy and encouragement in thy love, because the bowels of the sanctified have been refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to command thee that which is befitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>because of love I rather beseech, being such as aged Paul, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my child Onesimus, whom I begot in my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>A man formerly unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me, whom I sent back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>And thou should welcome him, that is, my bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I wanted to keep back for myself, so that in thy behalf he might serve me in the bonds of the good-news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I wanted to do nothing without thy mind, so that thy goodness might not be as from obligation, but from volition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps because of this he departed for an hour, so that thou might receive him back forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to thee, both in flesh and in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then thou have me a partner, accept him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if he has wronged thee, or owes anything, charge this to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul write with my hand, I will repay, so that I may not say to thee that thou owe me in return even thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have a favor of thee in Lord. Refresh my bowels in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Being confident in thine obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou will do above what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But simultaneously also prepare a lodging for me, for I hope that by your prayers I will be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, salutes thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my co-workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit. Truly.</verse>
