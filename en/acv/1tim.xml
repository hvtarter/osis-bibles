      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to a commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, a genuine child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I urged thee, while going to Macedonia, remain in Ephesis, so that thou might command certain men not to teach something different,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor to heed myths and endless genealogies, which cause controversies rather than stewardship of God in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and non-hypocritical faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>From which some having swerved have turned aside to empty talk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be law teachers, understanding neither what they say, nor about what they confidently assert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good, if any man uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this, that law is not laid down for righteous men, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the irreverent and sinful, for the impious and profane, for father killers and mother killers, for man killers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for fornicators, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the good-news of the glory of the blessed God, of which I was entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I have gratitude to the Christ--Jesus our Lord--who empowered me, because he considered me faithful, having placed in service</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>the man who was formerly blasphemous, and a persecutor, and an aggressor. But I obtained mercy because I did it being ignorant in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>And the grace of our Lord was filled to overflowing with the faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinful men, of whom I am foremost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But because of this I obtained mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, alone wise, to God is honor and glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This command I set before thee, child Timothy, according to the prophecies leading the way for thee, so that by them thou might war the good warfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having put away, made shipwreck about the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, so that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all those who are in prominence, so that we may live a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and propriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who wants all men to be saved and to come to knowledge of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony for their own times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore the men to pray in every place, lifting up devout hands, apart from anger and argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>And similarly, the women to adorn themselves in disciplined decorum, with reverence and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but (which is fitting for women professing godliness) through good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence in all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to act autonomously from a man, but to be in quietness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, became in transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>Faithful is the saying, If any man aspires to supervision, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>The overseer therefore must be blameless, the husband of one wife, without wine, serious minded, disciplined, loving strangers, able to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>no drunkard, not a fighter, not greedy of base gain, but meek, noncontentious, no lover of money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>a man who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all propriety</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(but if any man knows not how to rule his own house, how will he take care of a congregation of God?),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>And he must also have good testimony from those outside, lest he may fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Helpers likewise, be honorable, not double-tongued, not attending to much wine, not greedy of base gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And let these also first be proven, then being blameless, let them serve as deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>The wives likewise, be honorable, not slanderous, without wine, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let helpers be husbands of one wife, ruling children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those who serve well will acquire to themselves a good standing, and much boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee sooner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I delay, that thou may know how it is necessary to live in a house of God, which is a congregation of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And without controversy great is the mystery of piety. God was manifested in flesh, justified in spirit, seen by heavenly agents, proclaimed among nations, believed in the world, taken up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit says expressly that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>speaking lies in hypocrisy, their own conscience having been seared with a hot iron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods, which God created for partaking with thankfulness by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>Because every creation of God is good, and nothing rejected that is received with thankfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>Laying these things down to the brothers, thou will be a good helper of Jesus Christ, reared up in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine that thou have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But reject the profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself to piety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For we both labor and are reproached for this, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of the faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man disparage thy youth, but become an example of the faithful, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Think on these things--exist within these things--so that thy progress may be visible among all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Hold firm to thyself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this thou will save both thyself and those who hear thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not rebuke an elder man, but entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>elder women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Support widows, the real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be devoted to their own house, and to give back recompense to their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>But the real widow, and made alone, has hoped in God, and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who is self-indulgent is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And command these things, so that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if any man does not provide for his own, and especially those belonging his household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let no widow be enrolled under sixty years old, having become the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>being testified in good works: if she has reared children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the sanctified, if she has relieved those who are afflicted, if she has followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse younger widows, for when they are sexually aroused, they desire of the Christ to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>which has condemnation because they have disregarded the original pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And also at the same time they learn to be idle, roving the houses, and not only idle, but also babbling and meddlesome, speaking things that they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I desire therefore the younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage house, to give not one occasion to him who opposes on account of slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some have already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and let not the congregation be burdened, so that it may relieve the real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders who rule well be regarded worthy of double compensation, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture says thou shall not muzzle an ox that is threshing. And the workman is worthy of his wage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Accept no accusation against an elder, except at two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who sin, rebuke in the sight of all, so that the others may also have fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I solemnly testify before God, and Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen agents, that thou keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing from partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands hastily on no man, nor contribute to other sins. Keep thyself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer drink water, but use a little wine because of thy stomach and thy frequent weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The sins of some men are evident, leading to judgment, but also for some they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise also good works are evident, and those faring otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let bondmen, as many as are under a yoke, regard their own masters worthy of all respect, so that the name of God and the doctrine may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And those who have believing masters, let them not disparage them because they are brothers, instead let them serve more because they are believers and beloved--those who are recipients of the benefit. Teach and exhort these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any man teaches something different, and does not associate with wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine according to piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is puffed up, understanding nothing, but doting about disputes and word controversies, from which develop envy, strife, revilings, evil surmisings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>constant frictions of men corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing piety to be a means of gain. Withdraw from such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But piety with contentment is great gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>for we brought nothing into the world. It is clear that neither can we carry anything out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>but having food and covering we will be content with these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But those who want to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, which sink men in destruction and ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all the evils, of which some aspiring have wandered from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But thou, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, mildness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life for which thou are called, and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I command thee in the sight of God, who makes all live, and of Christ Jesus, who testified to Pontius Pilate the good confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that thou keep the commandment, without spot, blameless, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which he will show in his own times, the blessed and only Potentate, the King of those who are kings, and Lord of those who are lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality, dwelling in irreproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom is honor and eternal dominion. Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Command the rich in the present age not to be arrogant, nor hope in the uncertainty of wealth, but in the living God, who supplies us all things abundantly for enjoyment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>storing up for themselves a good foundation for that which is coming, so that they may take hold of the eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, keep the entrustment, avoiding the profane babblings and objections of the falsely-called knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some men professing have missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace is with thee. Truly.</verse>
