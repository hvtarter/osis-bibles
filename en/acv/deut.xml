      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>It is eleven days [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, according to all that LORD had given him in commandment to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough at this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and to all [the places] near thereto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he has promised you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take for you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou have spoken is good to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment. Ye shall hear the small and the great alike. Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you ye shall bring to me, and I will hea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as LORD our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said to you, Ye have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which LORD our God gives to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, LORD thy God has set the land before thee. Go up, take possession, as LORD, the God of thy fathers, has spoken to thee. Fear not, neither be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And ye came near to me, all of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the thing pleased me well. And I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which LORD our God gives to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven, and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>LORD your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness, where thou have seen how that LORD thy God bore thee, as a man bears his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing ye did not believe LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went before you in the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and I will give to him the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has wholly followed LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shall not go in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before thee, he shall go in there. Encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, who ye said would be a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against LORD, we will go up and fight according to all that LORD our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And LORD said to me, Say to them, Do not go up, neither fight, for I am not among you, lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken, but ye rebelled against the commandment of LORD, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites, who dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And ye returned and wept before LORD, but LORD did not hearken to your voice, nor gave ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode [there].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as LORD spoke to me. And we encompassed mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And LORD spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Ye have encompassed this mountain long enough, turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. Take ye good heed to yourselves therefore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Do not contend with them, for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Ye shall purchase food from them for money, that ye may eat, and ye shall also buy water from them for money, that ye may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For LORD thy God has blessed thee in all the work of thy hand. He has known thy walking through this great wilderness. These forty years LORD thy God has been with thee; thou have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>So we passed by from our brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And LORD said to me, Do not vex Moab, neither contend with them in battle, for I will not give thee of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim dwelt in it formerly, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>These also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites also dwelt in Seir formerly, but the sons of Esau succeeded them. And they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which LORD gave to them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we came over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as LORD swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Moreover the hand of LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>that LORD spoke to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when thou come near opposite the sons of Ammon, do not vex them, nor contend with them, for I will not give thee of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim. Rephaim dwelt in it formerly, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim. But LORD destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did for the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. And they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avvim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day I will begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through thy land. I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Thou shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on my feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee. Begin to possess, that thou may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And LORD our God delivered him up before us. And we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>We only took the cattle for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. LORD our God delivered up all before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only to the land of the sons of Ammon thou did not come near, all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wherever LORD our God forbad us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And LORD said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand. And thou shall do to him as thou did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So LORD our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the un-walled towns a great many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(the Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And we took this land in possession at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities of it, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. The same is called the land of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>(Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border [of it], even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>also the Arabah, and the Jordan and the border [of it], from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, LORD your God has given you this land to possess it. Ye shall pass over armed before your brothers the sons of Israel, all the men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan, then ye shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that LORD your God has done to these two kings. So shall LORD do to all the kingdoms where thou go over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>Ye shall not fear them, for LORD your God, he it is who fights for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O lord LORD, thou have begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand, for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But LORD was angry with me because of you, and did not hearken to me. And LORD said to me, It shall be enough for thee. Speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Get thee up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes, for thou shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley opposite Beth-peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>And now, O Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which LORD, the God of your fathers, gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of LORD your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what LORD did because of Baal-peor. For all the men who followed Baal-peor, LORD thy God has destroyed them from the midst of thee.</verse>
