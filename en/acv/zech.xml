      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of LORD came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>LORD was greatly displeased with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore say thou to them, Thus says LORD of hosts: Return to me, says LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says LORD of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings, but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned and said, Like as LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of LORD came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom. And behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the [heavenly] agent who talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the agent of LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the agent of LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou have had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And LORD answered the agent who talked with me with good words, comforting words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the [heavenly] agent who talked with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus says LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very greatly displeased with the nations that are at ease. For I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus says LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet again, saying, Thus says LORD of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, and LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the [heavenly] agent who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And LORD showed me four smiths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then I said, What are these coming to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>And I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then I said, Where do thou go? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem. To see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And, behold, the [heavenly] agent who talked with me went forth. And another [heavenly] agent went out to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, says LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says LORD. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Ho Zion, escape, thou who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus says LORD of hosts: After glory he has sent me to the nations which plundered you. For he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them. And ye shall know that LORD of hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall join themselves to LORD in that day, and shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee. And thou shall know that LORD of hosts has sent me to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And LORD shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, all flesh, before LORD, for he has arisen out of his holy habitation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the agent of LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And LORD said to Satan, LORD rebuke thee, O Satan. Yea, LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the [heavenly] agent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a clean miter upon his head. So they set a clean miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the agent of LORD was standing by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the agent of LORD testified to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus says LORD of hosts: If thou will walk in my ways, and if thou will keep my charge, then thou also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these who stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows who sit before thee, for they are men who are a sign. For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua. Upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave the graving of it, says LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, says LORD of hosts, ye shall invite each man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the [heavenly] agent who talked with me came again, and awoke me, as a man who is awakened out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And he said to me, What do thou see? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top o</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>And I answered and spoke to the [heavenly] agent who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the [heavenly] agent who talked with me answered and said to me, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who are thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel [thou shall become] a plain, and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it. And thou shall know that LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, the eyes of LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts that empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then he said, These are the two anointed ones, who stand by LORD of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me, What do thou see? And I answered, I see a flying roll. The length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cut off on the one side according to it, and everyone who swears shall be cut off on the other side according t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I will cause it to go forth, says LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the [heavenly] agent who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>(and, behold, a talent of lead was lifted up), and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This is Wickedness. And he cast her down into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then I said to the [heavenly] agent who talked with me, Where do these carry the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar. And when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And again I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot strong grizzled horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I answered and said to the [heavenly] agent who talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the [heavenly] agent answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before LORD of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>[The chariot] in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Get you from here. Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then he cried to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take from those of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>Yea, take [from them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks LORD of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. And he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>even he shall build the temple of LORD. And he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne. And he shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of LORD. And ye shall know that LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of LORD your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, even in Chislev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>Now [those of] Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>[and] to speak to the priests of the house of LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then the word of LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month], even these seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>[Should ye] not [hear] the words which LORD cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus LORD of hosts has spoken, saying, Execute TRUE justice, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And do not oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor man. And let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which LORD of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>And it has come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>But I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned. For they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the word of LORD of hosts came [to me], saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus says LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus says LORD: I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth, and the mountain of LORD of hosts, The holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus says LORD of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus says LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus says LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus says LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of LORD of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before those days there was no wage for man, nor any wage for beast, nor was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men each one against his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For [there shall be] the seed of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not. Let your hands be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For thus says LORD of hosts: As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says LORD of hosts, and I did not relent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear ye not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>And let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no FALSE oath. For all these are things that I hate, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>And the word of LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>Thus says LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah, joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.20'>Thus says LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, and the inhabitants of many cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.21'>And the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of LORD, and to seek LORD of hosts. I will go also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.22'>Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.23'>Thus says LORD of hosts: In those days, ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.9.1'>The burden of the word of LORD upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward LORD),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.2'>and also Hamath, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.3'>And Tyre built herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.4'>Behold, LORD will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.5'>Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be greatly pained, and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.6'>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.7'>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. And he also shall be a remnant for our God, and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.8'>And I will encamp the army around my house, that none pass through or return, and no oppressor shall pass through them any more. For now I have seen with my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.9'>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king comes to thee. He is just, and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt the foal of a donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.10'>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations. And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.11'>As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit in which is no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.12'>Turn you back to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will render double to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.13'>For I have bent Judah for me. I have filled the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.14'>And LORD shall be seen over them. And his arrow shall go forth as the lightning. And lord LORD will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.15'>LORD of hosts will defend them. And they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones. And they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine, and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.16'>And LORD their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people, [as] for the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.17'>For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.10'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.1'>Ask ye of LORD rain in the time of the latter rain, [even of] LORD who makes lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.2'>For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and they have told FALSE dreams. They comfort in vain. Therefore they go their way like sheep. They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.3'>My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats. For LORD of hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.4'>From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.5'>And they shall be as mighty men, treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight, because LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.6'>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back. For I have mercy upon them, and they shall be as though I had not cast them off. For I am LORD their God, and I will hear th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.7'>And Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine. Yea, their sons shall see it, and rejoice. Their heart shall be glad in LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.8'>I will whistle for them, and gather them. For I have redeemed them, and they shall increase as they have increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.9'>And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember me in far countries. And they shall live with their sons, and shall return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.10'>I will also bring them again out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and [until space] shall not be found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.11'>And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.12'>And I will strengthen them in LORD, and they shall walk up and down in his name, says LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.11'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.1'>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.2'>Wail, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the fine ones are destroyed. Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.3'>A voice of the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.4'>Thus said LORD my God: Feed the flock of slaughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.5'>whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be LORD, for I am rich, and their own shepherds pity them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.6'>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says LORD. But, lo, I will deliver the men each one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. And they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver them out of the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.7'>So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands, and I fed the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.8'>And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.9'>Then I said, I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die, and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off, and let those who are left eat each one the flesh of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.10'>And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.11'>And it was broken in that day, and thus the poor of the flock who gave heed to me knew that it was the word of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.12'>And I said to them, If ye think good, give me my wage, and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wage thirty [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.13'>And LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter, the good price that I was valued by them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.14'>Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.15'>And LORD said to me, Take to thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.16'>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound, but he will eat the flesh of the fat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.17'>Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye. His arm shall be entirely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.12'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.1'>The burden of the word of LORD concerning Israel. [Thus] says LORD, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.2'>Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also it shall be in the siege against Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.3'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it shall be severely wounded. And all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together agai</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.4'>In that day, says LORD, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness. And I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.5'>And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in LORD of hosts their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.6'>In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left, and Jerusalem shall yet ag</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.7'>LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.8'>In that day LORD shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he who is feeble among them at that day shall be as David, and the house of David shall be as God, as the agent of LORD before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.9'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.10'>And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication. And they shall look to me whom they have pierced. And they shall mourn for him, as [a man] mourns for his only</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.11'>In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.12'>And the land shall mourn, every family apart, the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart, the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.13'>the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart, the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.13.2'>And it shall come to pass in that day, says LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered. And I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.3'>And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, Thou shall not live, for thou speak lies in the name of LORD. And his father and his mother who begot him s</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.4'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed each one of his vision, when he prophesies, nor shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.5'>But he shall say, I am no prophet. I am a tiller of the ground, for I have been made a bondman from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.6'>And [a man] shall say to him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.7'>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my companion, says LORD of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. And I will turn my hand upon the little ones.</verse>
