        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>but his delight is in the law of LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. And whatever he does shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things (LXX/NT)?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against LORD, and against his anointed, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let us break their bonds apart, and cast away their cords from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He who sits in the heavens will laugh. LORD will have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his great displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the decree. LORD said to me, Thou are my son, this day I have begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and I will give [thee] the nations for thine inheritance, and the outermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>Thou shall break them with a rod of iron, thou shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now therefore be wise, O ye kings. Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>LORD, how my adversaries are increased! Many are those who rise up against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But thou, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory and he who lifts up of my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>I cry to LORD with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I laid down and slept. I awoke, for LORD sustains me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people who have set themselves against me round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, O LORD. Save me, O my God. For thou have smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone. Thou have broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongs to LORD. Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness. Thou have enlarged me in distress. Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that LORD has set apart for himself him who is holy. LORD will hear when I call to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Stand in awe, and sin not. Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>Many there are who say, Who will show us good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>Thou have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>In peace I will both lay down and sleep, for thou, LORD, alone make me dwell in safety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.1'>Give ear to my words, O LORD, Consider my meditation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.2'>Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God, for to thee do I pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>O LORD, in the morning thou shall hear my voice. In the morning I will direct to thee, and will keep watch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For thou are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil shall not sojourn with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight. Thou hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>Thou will destroy those who speak lies. LORD abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, in the abundance of thy loving kindness I will come into thy house. In thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of my enemies. Make thy way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is very wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongue they deceive (LXX/NT).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Hold them guilty, O God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions. For they have rebelled against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>But let all those who take refuge in thee rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defend them. Let those also who love thy name be joyful in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For thou will bless the righteous man, O LORD. Thou will encompass him with favor as with a shield. Selah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am withered away. O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul also is greatly troubled. And thou, O LORD, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul. Save me for thy loving kindness' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For in death there is no remembrance of thee. In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary with my groaning. Every night I make my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>LORD has heard my supplication. LORD will receive my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.10'>All my enemies shall be put to shame and greatly troubled. They shall turn back. They shall be put to shame suddenly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.1'>O LORD my God, in thee do I take refuge. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.2'>lest they tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me, (yea, I have delivered him without cause who was my adversary),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it. Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger. Lift up thyself against the rage of my adversaries, and awake for me the justice thou have commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>And let the congregation of the peoples encompass thee about, and return thou on high over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.8'>LORD shall judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.9'>O let the wickedness of the wicked man come to an end, but establish thou the righteous man. For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.10'>My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.11'>God is a righteous judge. Yea, a God who has indignation every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.12'>If a man does not repent, he will whet his sword. He has bent his bow, and made it ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.13'>He has also prepared for him the instruments of death. He makes his arrows fiery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.14'>Behold [the wicked man], he travails with iniquity. Yea, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>He has made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own scalp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.17'>I will give thanks to LORD according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of LORD Most High.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.8.1'>O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who has set thy glory upon the heavens!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.8.2'>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou have perfected praise (LXX/NT), because of thine adversaries, that thou might still the enemy and the avenger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.8.3'>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou have ordained,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.8.4'>what is man that thou remember him? And the son of man that thou succor him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.9.3'>When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.4'>For thou have maintained my right and my cause. Thou sit in the throne judging righteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.5'>Thou have rebuked the nations. Thou have destroyed the wicked. Thou have blotted out their name forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.6'>The enemy have come to an end. They are desolate forever, and the cities which thou have overthrown. The very memory of them is perished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.7'>but LORD will endure forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.8'>and he will judge the world in righteousness. He will minister justice to the peoples in uprightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.9'>LORD will also be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.10'>And those who know thy name will put their trust in thee, for thou, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.9.16'>LORD has made himself known. He has executed justice. The wicked man is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.17'>Wicked men shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.10.1'>Why do thou stand afar off, O LORD? Why do thou hide thyself in times of trouble?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.2'>In the pride of the wicked man the poor man is hotly pursued. Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.10.4'>The wicked man, in the pride of his countenance, [says], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.5'>His ways are profane at all times. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight. As for all his adversaries, he puffs at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.6'>He says in his heart, I shall not be moved. To all generations I shall not be in adversity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.7'>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.8'>He sits in the lurking-places of the villages. In the covert places he murders the innocent man. His eyes are secretly set against the poor man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.10.11'>He says in his heart, God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.10.13'>Why does the wicked man despise God, and say in his heart, Thou will not require [it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.14'>Thou have seen. For thou behold mischief and spite, to repay with thy hand. The poor man commits [himself] to thee. Thou have been the helper of the fatherless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.15'>Break thou the arm of the sinner and the evil man. His wickedness shall be sought, and shall not be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.16'>LORD is King forever and ever. The nations have perished out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.17'>LORD, thou have heard the desire of the humble. Thou will prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.11.4'>LORD is in his holy temple. LORD's throne is in heaven. His eyes, behold, his eyelids try, the sons of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Then LORD awoke as out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>And he smote his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.71'>He brought him from following the ewes that have their young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</verse>
