  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to arrange in order a narration about the deeds that have been brought to fullness among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they delivered them to us, who became from the beginning eyewitnesses and servants of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it occurred to me also, having followed closely from the beginning all things accurately, to write to thee in order, eminent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that thou might know the certainty of the declarations about which thou were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, named Zacharias, from the division of Abijah, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, going in all the commandments and righteous things of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And there was no child to them because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>But it came to pass during his service as a priest in the course of his division in the presence of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>that, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to burn incense after entering into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an agent of Lord became visible to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias having seen, was shaken, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the agent said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy plea was heard, and thy wife Elizabeth will bear a son for thee. And thou shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And there will be joy and exultation for thee, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he should, no, not drink wine and strong drink. And he will be filled of Holy Spirit, even from his mother's belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he will go ahead, in front of him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of fathers toward children, and the disobedient in a mentality of the righteous, to make ready for Lord a people prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the agent, How will I know this? For I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And having answered, the agent said to him, I am Gabriel who stand in the presence of God. And I was sent to speak to thee, and to announce these good news to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, thou will be mute, and not able to speak until that day these things will come to pass, because thou did not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they wondered during his delay in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was beckoning to them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she concealed herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus the Lord has done to me during the days in which he looked, to take away my shame among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the agent Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the agent having come in near her, he said, Hail, thou who are highly favored. The Lord is with thee, thou who are blessed among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But having seen, she was perplexed at his saying, and was pondering what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the agent said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, thou will conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son. And thou shall call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>This man will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he will reign over the house of Jacob into the ages. And of his kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the agent, How will this be, since I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And having answered, the agent said to her, Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee. Therefore also the holy thing that is begotten will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, Elizabeth thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For no word from God will be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the maid-servant of Lord. May it happen to me according to thy word. And the agent departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And having risen in these days, Mary went with haste into the hill country, into a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled of Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and she exclaimed in a great voice, and said, Blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For lo, when the voice of thy greeting happened in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who believed, because there will be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>because he has looked upon the lowliness of his bondmaid. For behold, from henceforth all generations will regard me blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>because the Mighty has done great things to me. And his name is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is for generations of generations to those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He did a mighty work by his arm. He scattered the proud in the mentality of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He brought down potentates from thrones, and raised up lowly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He filled those who are hungry with good things, and those who are rich he sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He helped his boy Israel to be reminded of mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and his seed into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary dwelt with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time for Elizabeth was fulfilled for her to give birth, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and her kinfolk heard that Lord magnified his mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling it by the name of his father Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother having answered, said, No, but he will be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is no man among thy relatives who is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, whatever he wanted to call him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue, and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear developed in all who dwell around them. And all these sayings were talked about in the entire hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard stored up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled of Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed is Lord, the God of Israel, because he came to help, and made ransom for his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And he raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his boy David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>just as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to do mercy with our fathers, and his holy covenant to be remembered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to give to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>without fear from the hand of our enemies, having been saved to serve him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in piety and righteousness before him all our the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. For thou will go ahead, before the face of Lord, to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>because of the bowels of mercy of our God, by which the dayspring from on high came to help us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into a way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit. And he was in the desolate regions until the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it came to pass in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to enroll all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This enrollment first occurred when Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be enrolled, each into his personal city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and patriarchy of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to enroll himself with Mary, the woman who was betrothed to him, being pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bring forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her son, the firstborn, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in the feed trough, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in the same region living in the fields, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And behold, an agent of Lord stood near them, and the glory of Lord shone around them. And they feared a great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the agent said to them, Fear not, for behold, I bring you good-news of great joy that will be to all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>because to you was born today in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is the sign to you: Ye will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a feed trough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there came to be with the agent a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, as the agents went away from them into heaven, that the men (the shepherds) said to each other, Let us indeed go through as far as Bethlehem, and see this declaration that has come to pass, which the Lord made</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And having hastened, they came and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the feed trough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw it, they informed about the declaration that was told them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it wondered about the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these proclamations, pondering in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they heard and saw, as it was told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise him, that his name was called JESUS, the one called by the heavenly agent before he was conceived in the belly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(just as it is written in a law of Lord that every male that opens a womb will be called holy to the Lord),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in a law of Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the encouragement of Israel, and Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was divinely revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death before he would see the Christ of Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, for them to do according to the custom of the law about him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he also received it into his arms, and praised God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now dismiss thy bondman in peace, Master, according to thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>because my eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which thou prepared toward the face of all the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for enlightenment of Gentiles, and glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things being spoken about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this man is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign being repudiated</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(and also of thee, a sword will pierce through thine own soul), so that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (being advanced in many days, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and this woman was a widow to eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and supplications night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And having stood near at that same hour, she acknowledged the Lord, and spoke about him to all those who were awaiting redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they completed all things according to the law of Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he became twelve years old, them having gone up according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and having fulfilled the days, during their return the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and his mother did not know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but, having supposed him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey. And they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Child, why did thou this way to us? Behold, thy father and I were seeking thee sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, Why is it that ye were seeking me? Had ye not known that I must be among the things of my Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was being subordinate to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip being tetrarch of the region belonging to Ituraea, and of the region of</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God became in John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching an immersion of repentance for remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, which says, The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low. And the crooked things will be into straight and the rough into smooth ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh will see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the crowds questioned him, saying, What then shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And having answered, he says to them, He who has two coats, let him share with him not having, and he who has food, let him do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, Teacher, what should we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, Collect not one thing more than from what has been appointed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And men who were soldiers also questioned him, saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And as the people were expectant, and all pondering in their hearts about John, if perhaps he was the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John responded, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water, but a man mightier than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to unloose the strap of his shoes. He will immerse you in Holy Spirit and fire,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked it, saying, Be thou muzzled, and come out of him. And the demon having thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, not having harm him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement developed in all, and they spoke among each other, saying, What is this word? Because with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it became day, having departed, he went to a desolate place. And the multitudes sought him, and they came to him, and were restraining him not depart from them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and having stood still, he was beside the lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And he saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen having gone out of them, were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And having entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And having sat down, he taught the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the depth, and let down your nets for a catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And having answered, Simon said to him, Master, having toiled through the whole night, we took nothing, but at thy saying, I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was tearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, after coming, to assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so as for them to be sunk down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But Simon Peter having seen, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For astonishment surrounded him, and all those with him, at the catch of the fishes that they caught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou will be catching men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And when they brought their boats to land, after forsaking all, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And having seen Jesus, having fallen on his face, he besought him, saying, Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report about him went through more, and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him from their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he himself was withdrawing into the desolate regions, and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass during one of those days, he was also teaching. And there were seated Pharisees and law teachers, who were men having come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of Lord was to heal</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men bringing a man on a bed who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And not having found how they might bring him in because of the multitude, after going up upon the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with the small bed into the midst in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scholars and the Pharisees began to deliberate, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I say to thee, Arise, and after taking up thy small bed, go to thy house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made a great feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were relaxing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And their scholars and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those faring badly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the wedding hall fast while the bridegroom is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will also come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he also spoke a parable to them. No man puts a patch of a new garment on an old garment, otherwise both the new tears, and that from the new will not blend with the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins, and will itself be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no man having drunk old straightaway desires new, for he says, The old is better.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurion's bondman faring badly was going to perish, who was esteemed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And having heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him who asked him that, having come, he would save his bondman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus they urged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou may offer this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far distant from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore neither did I consider myself worthy to come to thee, but speak by word, and my boy will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this man, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my bondman, Do this, and he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled him, and having turned around to the multitude who followed him, he said, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And those who were sent, having returned to the house, found the bondman who was feeble, being well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it came to pass on the next day that he went to a city called Nain, and a considerable number of his disciples went with him, also a large multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, an only begotten son who died was being carried out for his mother. And she was a widow, and a considerable crowd of the city were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he felt compassion toward her, and said to her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And having come, he touched the coffin, and the men carrying it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised among us, and, God came to help his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report about him went forth in the whole of Judea, and in all the region around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John informed him about all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And having summoned a certain two of his disciples, John sent them to Jesus, saying, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when they came to him, they said, John the immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in the same hour he healed many from diseases and plagues and evil spirits. And he granted sight to many blind men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And having answered, Jesus said to them, After going, report to John the things that ye saw and heard: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor are preached good-new</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he, whoever will not be offended by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And after John's messengers departed, he began to say to the multitudes about John, What did ye go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did ye go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those in elegant clothing, and existing in luxury, are in kingly places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did ye go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he about whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say to you, among men born of women there is not one prophet greater than John the immerser, yet the smaller in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people having heard, and the tax collectors who were immersed the immersion of John, justified God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and the lawyers who were not immersed by him, rejected the purpose of God for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To what, then will I compare the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling to each other, and saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance. We mourned to you, and ye did not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the immerser has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold the man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>And wisdom is justified from all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And a certain man of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having entered into the Pharisee's house, he sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman in the city who was sinful. And when she knew that he sat in the Pharisee's house, having brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and having stood behind near his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with the tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. And she kissed his feet much, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>But when the Pharisee who invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what kind the woman is who touches him, that she is sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And having responded, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, speak Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There were two debtors to a certain creditor, the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And of them not having to repay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore, do thou say, will love him more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>And having answered, Simon said, I suppose that it was to whom he forgave more. And he said to him, Thou have judged correctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, See thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gave no water for my feet. But this woman has wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>Thou gave me no kiss, but this woman, since I came in, has not ceased kissing my feet much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>Thou did not anoint my head with olive oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>For this reason I say to thee, her many sins are forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those who sat together began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee. Go in peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass that he traveled through, by city and village in succession, announcing and preaching the good-news of the kingdom of God, and the twelve men with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who were healed from evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women who served them from the things they possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a large multitude gathered together, and those coming to him from each city, he spoke by a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The man who sows went forth to sow his seed. And during his sowing, some fell by the way, and it was trampled, and the birds of the sky devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And another fell on the rock, and having grown, it withered away because of not having moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And another fell amidst the thorns, and having grown together, the thorns choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And another fell on the good ground, and having grown it produced fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples questioned him, saying, What is this parable?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others in parables, so that seeing they would not see, and hearing they would not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this. The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>And those by the way are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they would be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. And these have no root, who believe for a time, and withdraw in time of trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell in the thorns, these are those who heard, and as they go they are choked by cares and wealth and pleasures of life, and do not bring to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But those in the good ground, these are those who in an good and right heart, having heard the word, hold it firm, and bring forth fruit in perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>And no man, having lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or places it under a bed, but places it on a lampstand, so that those who enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is no secret that will not become visible, nor hid, that will not be known and come to be visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Notice therefore how ye hear. For whoever has, to him will be given, and whoever has not, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>And his mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was reported to him, saying, Thy mother and thy brothers stand outside, desiring to see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But having answered, he said to them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, also his disciples. And he said to them, Let us pass through to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>but as they sailed he began to asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling up, and were in peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And having approached, they awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. And having risen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it became calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, Where is your faith? And having feared, they wondered, saying to each other, Who then is this man, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed toward the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when he came forth upon the land, a certain man met him out of the city, who had demons of a considerable time. And he wore no clothing, and did not dwell in a house, but in the sepulchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And when he saw Jesus, having cried out, he fell down before him. And in a great voice he said, What is with me and with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man, for many times it had seized him. And he was bound with chains and shackles, and guarded. And breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desolate regi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus demanded him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion, because many demons were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they entreated him that he would not command them to to out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now a herd of considerable swine was there feeding on the mountain, and they implored him that he would allow them to enter into those. And he allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And the demons having come out from the man, they entered into the swine. And the herd stampeded down the slope into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when those who tended them saw what happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And they came out to see what happened. And they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons had gone out, sitting near the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And also those who saw it informed them how the man who was demon-possessed was saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole multitude of the region around the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them, because they were gripped by great fear. And he, having embarked into the boat, returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thy house, and relate everything God did for thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city how many things Jesus did for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass during Jesus returning, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And having fallen down near Jesus' feet, he besought him to come into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because there was with him an only begotten daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But during his going the multitudes thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman being with an issue of blood for twelve years, who, although she spent her entire living on physicians, was unable to be healed by any,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>having come from behind, she touched the border of his garment. And immediately the issue of her blood stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who is he who touched me? But when they all denied, Peter and those with him, said, Master, the multitudes come together and crowd thee, and thou say, Who is he who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, Who touched me? For I perceived power having gone forth from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling. And having fallen down before him, she declared to him in the presence of all the people for what reason she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said to her, Cheer up, Daughter. Thy faith has healed thee. Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he still spoke, some man comes from the synagogue ruler, saying to him, Thy daughter has died. Do not trouble the teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But having heard it, Jesus answered him, saying, Fear not, only believe and she will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when he came to the house, he did not allow any man to enter in except Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and the mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all were weeping and bewailing her. But he said, Weep not. She did not die, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they ridiculed him, knowing that she died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But having sent them all away outside, having taken her by the hand, he called out, saying, Girl, awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. And he commanded to give her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were amazed, but he ordered them to tell no man that which happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And having summoned the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal those who were incapacitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staffs, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor have two coats each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>And into whatever house ye may enter, remain there, and from there depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And as many as will not receive you, when departing from that city, also shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>And having departed, they passed through the villages, preaching the good-news, and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>But Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah appeared, and by others that a prophet, one of the ancient men arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And when the apostles returned, they related to him as many things as they did. And having taken them along, he withdrew in private into a desolate place of a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the multitudes having known, they followed him. And having received them, he spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>And the day began to decline, and the twelve having come near, they said to him, Send the multitude away, so that, after going into the villages and fields around, they may rest and find provision, because we are here in a desolate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are for us not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless, after going, we might buy food for all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And they ate, and were all filled. And there were taken up to them of the remaining fragments, twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it came to pass, as he was praying privately, the disciples were with him. And he questioned them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>And having answered, they said, John the immerser, but others, Elijah, and others, that a certain prophet of the ancient men arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>And he said to them, But ye, who say ye that I am? And having answered, Peter said, The Christ of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But having chided them, he commanded to tell this to no man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, It is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scholars, and be killed, and the third day to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said to all, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever may lose his life because of me, this man will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what is a man benefited, having gained the whole world, but having lost or having forfeited himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever may be ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of this man when he comes in his glory, and of the Father, and of the holy agents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that after taking Peter and John and James, he went up onto the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing glistening white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who, having appeared in glory, spoke of his departure, which he was going to fulfill at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, and having become awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, and we could make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he was sayi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And while he was speaking these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And at the occurrence of the voice, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and informed no man in those days any of the things that they have seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son, because he is the only begotten to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And lo, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with foaming. And it departs from him difficultly, injuring him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I begged thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you and endure you? Bring thy son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was still a coming, the demon tore him, and he convulsed. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while all were wondering at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Place ye these sayings into your ears, for the Son of man is going to be delivered up into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they did not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>But a thought entered among them, which of them may be greater.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but thou, after departing, proclaim the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And also another said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those in my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to a plow, and looking to things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying, In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God, and did not regard man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And a widow was in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And God, will he, no, not do the vengeance of his chosen who cry out to him day and night, and yet being patient toward them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he also spoke this parable to some of those who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous, and disdained other men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>Having stood by himself, the Pharisee prayed these things: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, predatory, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice per Sabbath. I tithe all things, as many as I acquire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the tax collector, having stood from afar, would not even lift his eyes to the sky, but beat upon his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that man. Because every man who lifts himself up will be made lower, and he who makes himself lower will be lifted up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he came near, having seen the city, he wept over it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. And having heard it, they said, May it not happen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But having looked upon them, he said, What then is this that is written, The stone that those who build rejected, this became the head of the corner?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Display to me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? And having answered, they said, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And he said to them, Then render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were unable to lay hold of his word before the people. And having marveled at his answer, they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>And some of the Sadducees having approached, those who say there is no resurrection, they questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, if any brother dies, having a wife, and this man dies childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were therefore seven brothers. And the first having taken a wife, died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took the woman, and this man died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>And the third likewise took her, and likewise also the seven; they left behind no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>And last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them does she become? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And having answered, Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>For neither can they die any more, for they are like the heavenly agents, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the Bush when he calls Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the scholars having answered, they said, Teacher, thou said well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to question him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, How do they say the Christ is David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Even David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I will place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scholars, who desire to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows' houses, and in pretence make long prayers. These will receive greater damnation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed together to give him silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he consented and sought opportunity to betray him to them apart from the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>And the day of unleavened bread came during which it was necessary to kill the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And he sent Peter and John, saying, After departing, prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>And they said to him, Where do thou want that we should prepare?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>And he said to them, Behold, having entered into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>And having gone, they found just as he said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when the hour came, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before my suffering.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And having come out, he proceeded according to his habit to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And when he came at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And he knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, Father, if thou want, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And an agent from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And having become in agony he prayed more intensely, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And after rising up from his prayer, having come to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>And said to them, Why sleep ye? Having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he yet spoke, behold, a multitude, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>But Jesus said to him, Judas, thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>And when those who were around him saw what would be, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And a certain one of them struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But having answered, Jesus said, Allow ye as far as this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came to him, Have ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>When I was with you daily in the temple, ye did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And having seized him, they led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>And having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>But a certain servant girl having seen him sitting near the light, and having looked intently upon him, she said, This man was also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little while, another man having see him, said, Thou also are from them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>And about one hour having passed, some other man insisted, saying, In truth this man was also with him, for he is also a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>And Peter said, Man, I do not know what thou are saying. And immediately, while he still spoke, a cock sounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And having turned, the Lord looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before a cock sounds thou will deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And having gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men who held Jesus mocked him, while striking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>And having covered him, they struck his face, and demanded him, saying, Prophesy! Who is he who struck thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they spoke many other things against him, railing against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when it became day, the eldership of the people, the chief priests, and the scholars, came together, and led him into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>If thou are the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if I also ask, ye will, no, not answer nor release.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>From henceforth the Son of man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>And they all said, Therefore thou are the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have heard from his mouth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And having risen, the whole company of them led him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ, a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And having answered him, he said, Thou say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing guilty in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were emphatic, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee as far as here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>And when Pilate heard Galilee, he questioned if the man is a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he perceived that he is from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem in these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he was wanting of a considerable time to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he hoped to see some sign happening by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>And he interrogated him in considerable words, but he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scholars had stood, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>But Herod having disdained him with his soldiers, and having mocked him, having arraying him in a bright robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And both Pilate and Herod became friends with each other on the same day, for they were formerly being at enmity toward themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, Ye brought this man to me as turning away the people. And behold, I, having examined him before you, found nothing guilty in this man of what ye accuse against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>But not even Herod, for I sent you back to him, and lo, nothing having been done by him is worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Therefore, having scourged I will release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>Now he had need to release one man to them at every feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they cried out all together, saying, Take away this man, and release to us Barabbas</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(a man who was cast into prison because of a certain insurrection that occurred in the city, and for murder).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Again therefore Pilate called out wanting to release Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said to them a third time, For what evil did this man do? I have found nothing guilty of death in him. I will therefore, having scourged, release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were relentless with loud voices demanding him to be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate decreed their request to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released the man who had been cast into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they asked for, but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And when they led him away, having taken hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the countryside, they laid the cross on him to bring behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people followed him, and also of women who bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But having turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, instead weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>Because, behold, the days are coming, during which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the bellies that gave no birth, and the breasts that did not suckle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two other men, malefactors, were also led with him to be executed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one at the right hand and the other at the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing his garments, they cast a lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people had stood watching. And also the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others. He should save himself, if this is the Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If thou are the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription over him written in letters, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed him, saying, If thou are the Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other man having answered, rebuking him, saying, Thou fear not even God, since thou are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we receive worthy of what we did, but this man did nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou come into thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, today thou will be with me in the paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, having sounded out in a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands I entrust my spirit. And having said these things, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And when the centurion saw that which happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the multitudes who came together to this scene, watching that which happened, turned back, beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintances, and the women who accompanied him from Galilee, had stood from afar, seeing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold a man named Joseph, a council member, being a good and righteous man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this man not having consented to their purpose and deed), was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also himself awaited the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man having gone to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher cut in rock, of which no man was yet lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And the day was beginning. It was a preparation Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And having followed closely, the women who were gathered to him out of Galilee, they saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And having returned, they prepared spices and ointments. And they indeed rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early morning, they came to the sepulcher bringing the spices that they prepared, and some women with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And having entered in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass while they were bewildered about this, that behold, two men stood near them in shining apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And since they became frightened and bowing down their face to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but was raised. Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And having returned from the sepulcher, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they disbelieved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But having risen, Peter ran to the sepulcher. And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths laying alone. And he departed, wondering to himself at that which happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village that was sixty furlongs away from Jerusalem, which name was Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they conversed with each other about all these things that happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, while they conversed and discussed, that Jesus himself also having approached, went along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held, not to recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What are these words that ye toss back to each other, while walking and are looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one, whose name was Cleopas, having answered, said to him, Thou only visit Jerusalem and do not know the things that happened in it during these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What? And they said to him, The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, a mighty man in work and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up for condemnation of death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped that he is the man who is going to redeem Israel. But even with all these things, it brings this third day today from which time these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>But also some of our women astonished us, having come to be at the sepulcher early morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of heavenly agents who say he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of those with us went to the sepulcher, and found it this way, just as also the women said, but they did not see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they came near to the village where they were going, and he pretended to go further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us, because it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass during his dining with them, that, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken in pieces he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he became invisible from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to each other, Was not our heart burning within us while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And having risen up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>and those who were with them who said, The Lord really was raised, and was seen by Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they reported the things on the road, and how he was made known to them during the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But having seen startled, and having become frightened, they presumed to see a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having said this, he displayed to them his hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they still disbelieved from joy and wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything to eat here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and from a bees honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And having taken it, he ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary for all things that are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms about me to be fulfulled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their mind to understand the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and to proclaim in his name repentance and remission of sins for all the nations, having begun from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And ye are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But stay ye in the city until ye are clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them outside as far as to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was brought up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And having worshiping him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Truly.</verse>
