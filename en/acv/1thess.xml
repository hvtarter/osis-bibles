      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We thank God always about all of you, making recollection of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, beloved brothers, your selection by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because the good-news from us happened to you not in word only, but also in power, and in Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, as ye know what kind of men we became among you, because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>in order for you to become examples to all those who believe, in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they report about us what kind of entrance we had with you, and how ye turned to God from the idols to serve a living and TRUE God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to await his Son from the heavens whom he raised from the dead--Jesus--who rescues us from the coming wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For ye yourselves know, brothers, our entrance with you, that it has not become empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But having suffered before and been mistreated in Philippi, as ye know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the good-news of God within much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not from error, nor from uncleanness, nor in deception,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good-news, thus we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who proves our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For we came neither in word of flattery (at any time as ye know) nor a pretense of greed (God is witness)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory from men, neither from you nor from others. While able to bear down as apostles of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>nevertheless we became gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Thus being desirous of you, we were pleased to impart to you, not only the good-news of God, but also our own souls, because ye have become beloved to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brothers, our labor and the hardship. For, laboring night and day in order not to burden any of you, we preached to you the good-news of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye are witnesses, and God, how piously and justly and blamelessly we became to you who believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>just as ye know, as each one of you as a father of his own children, imploring you, and comforting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and solemnly declaring for you to walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And because of this we thank God without ceasing, because, having received the word of God heard from us, ye received not the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For ye, brothers, became imitators of the congregations of God, which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because ye also suffered the same things by your own countrymen, just as also they by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>The men who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and who persecuted us, and are not pleasing to God, and are contrary to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles so that they might be saved, in order to fill up their sins always. But wrath came upon them finally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, who were orphaned from you for the time of an hour, in presence not in heart, hastened more earnestly to see your face, with much desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I, Paul, even once and again, and Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boast? Or is it not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For ye are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore, no longer covering over it, we preferred to be left behind in Athens alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And we sent Timothy, our brother, and a helper of God, and our fellow workman in the good-news of the Christ, in order to establish you and to encourage you about your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>for no man to be disturbed by these afflictions. For ye yourselves know that we are set for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For also when we were with you we foretold you that we were going to be oppressed, just as it also happened, and ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Because of this, I too, no longer covering over it, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow he who tempts was tempting you, and our labor became in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now of Timothy, having come to us from you, and having proclaimed good news to us of your faith and love, and that ye always have a good recollection of us, longing to see us, just as we also you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this, brothers, we were encouraged toward you in all our affliction and necessity through your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>Because now we live, if ye stand firm in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we repay God about you, for all the joy in which we rejoiced because of you before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>praying night and day above extraordinary in order to see your face and to mend the deficiencies of your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love toward each other, and toward all men, just as also we toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>in order to establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his sanctified.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally therefore, brothers, we ask you, and summon in Lord Jesus, that just as ye received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God, that ye may abound more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, your sanctification, for you to abstain from fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>for each of you to know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and reverence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in passion of lust, as also the Gentiles who have not known God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>not to transgress and to cheat his brother in the affair, because the Lord is vengeful about all these things, as also we forewarned you and solemnly testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who disregards, disregards not man, but God, who also gave his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But about brotherly love ye have no need to write to you, for ye yourselves are taught by God in order to love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>For ye are also doing it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, to abound more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to aspire to live quietly, and to do your own things, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>so that ye may walk properly toward those outside, and may have nothing lacking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who are asleep, so that ye may not grieve, as also the others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and arose, so also those who became asleep through Jesus, God will bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you in the word of Lord, that we who are alive, who remain for the coming of the Lord, will no, not precede those who became asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the arch-agent, and with a trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up simultaneously with them in clouds to the Lord's gathering in the air. And so we will always be with Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore encourage each other with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But about the times and the seasons, brothers, ye have no need to be written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For ye yourselves know accurately that the day of Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction approaches them, as the woman having birth pangs in her womb, and they will, no, not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But ye, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day would seize you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>Ye are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>So then let us not sleep, as also the others, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are intoxicated get drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But we, being of the day, should be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>Because God appointed us not for wrath, but for an acquired possession of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>So that, whether we are awake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore encourage each other, and build ye up one by one, just as ye also are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you, and who lead you in Lord, and who admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them with exceptional love because of their work. Live peaceably among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And we encourage you, brothers, admonish the unruly, strengthen the weak-spirited, help the infirmed, be patient toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that not any man repays evil for evil to any man, but always pursue the good, both for each other and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything express thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not disdain prophecies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>but examine all things. Hold firm the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And may the God of peace himself sanctify you thoroughly. And may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, blamelessly at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he who calls you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brothers by a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord that the letter be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you. Truly.</verse>
