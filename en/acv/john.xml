      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This man was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came to be through him, and apart from him not even one thing came to be that has come to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>A man came to be who was sent from God, his name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This man came for testimony so that he might testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>That man was not the light, but that he might testify about the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>He was the TRUE light coming into the world that enlightens every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own did not accept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as did accept him, to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were begotten, not from blood, nor from a will of flesh, nor from a will of man, but from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified about him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me came to be before me, because he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And from his fullness we all received, even grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>Because the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, being in the bosom of the Father, that man reported him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, Who are thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and did not deny, and confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What therefore, are thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said therefore to him, Who are thou, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do thou say about thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of Lord, just as the prophet Isaiah said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said to him, Why therefore do thou immerse if thou are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but amidst you stands him whom ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He is the man who comes after me, who has become before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loosen the strap of his shoe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things occurred in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and he says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he about whom I said, After me comes a man who has become before me, because he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I had not known him, but that he would be made known to Israel. Because of this I came immersing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I had not known him. But he who sent me to immerse in water, he said to me, Upon whomever thou will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, this is he who immerses in Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus having turned, and having seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which says, being interpreted, Teacher), where do thou dwell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard from John and who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>This man first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And having seen him, Jesus said, Thou are Simon the son of Jonah. Thou will be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow he wanted to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets wrote: Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, What good can be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael says to him, How do thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered, and says to him, Rabbi, thou are the Son of God. Thou are the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believe? Thou will see greater than these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, henceforth ye will see the heaven opened, and the agents of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day a wedding occurred in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And having lacked wine the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus says to her, What is with me and with thee, woman? My hour is not yet here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother says to the helpers, Whatever he may say to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six stone water pots laying there in accordance with the purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus says to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them until over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry to the feast-ruler. And they carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when the feast-ruler tasted the water that became wine, and had not known from where it was (but the helpers who drew the water had known), the feast-ruler called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and says to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they drank much, then the lesser. Thou have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This is the beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they remained there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found sitting in the temple those who sell oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And having made a whip from cords, he drove all out from the temple, both the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and turned over their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And he said to those who sell the doves, Take these things from here. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it is written, Zeal for thy house will consume me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him, What sign do thou show us since thou do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews therefore said, This temple was forty-six years being built, and will thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But that man spoke about the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spoke this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in his name seeing his signs that he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he had no need that any man should testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou have come a teacher from God, for no man can do these signs that thou do if God is not with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be begotten, being old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's belly, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from water and Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is begotten from the flesh is flesh, and that which is begotten from the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said to thee, ye must be begotten from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it will, and thou hear the sound of it, but know not from where it comes, and where it goes. So is every man who is begotten from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things happen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Thou are the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to thee, we speak that which we know, and testify of what we have seen, and ye do not accept our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I told you earthly things, and ye do not believe, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no man has ascended into heaven, except he who came down out of heaven: the Son of man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent the Son into the world not that he might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every man who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the Jewish land. And he remained there with them and immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Therefore a debate developed from John's disciples with the Jews about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, about whom thou have testified, behold, this man immerses, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves testify that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent ahead of that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This therefore my joy is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>It is necessary for that man to increase, but me to decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all things. He who is of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he has seen and heard, of this he testifies, and no man receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who has received his testimony has set a seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself did not immerse, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the place that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied from the journey, thus was sitting on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone away into the city so that they might buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How do thou, being Jewish, ask to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman, for Jews do not associate with Samaritans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If thou had known the gift of God, and who it is who says to thee, Give me to drink, thou would have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman says to him, Sir, thou have not even a container, and the well is deep. From where then have thou the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his livestock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Every man who drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will, no, not thirst into the age. But the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman says to him, Give me this water, sir, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou said correctly, I have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For thou have had five husbands, and he whom thou now have is not thy husband. This thou have said true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that thou are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour is coming when neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem will ye worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship what ye do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But an hour comes, and now is, when the TRUE worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for also the Father seeks such kind who worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When that man comes he will declare all things to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this his disciples came. And they marveled that he spoke with the woman, yet no man said, What seek thou? or, Why do thou speak with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman therefore left her water pot, and departed into the city, and says to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who told me all, as many things as I did. Is not this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meanwhile the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples therefore said to each other, Did any man bring him to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus says to them, My food is that I do the will of him who sent me, and may finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do ye not say, There are still four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, that they are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reaps receives a wage and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this the saying is true, One is who sows, and another who reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap what ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all, as many things as I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to remain with them, and he remained there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman, We no longer believe because of thy speaking, for we have heard ourselves, and know that this really is the Savior of the world, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he departed from there and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Jesus therefore came again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This man having heard that Jesus comes out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said to him, Unless may ye see signs and wonders, ye will, no, not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his bondmen met him and reported, saying, Thy boy lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired of them the hour in which he fared well. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives. And he himself believed and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This again is a second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the place pertaining to sheep, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of those who are feeble, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the movement of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For a heavenly agent went down at a certain time into the pool, and agitated the water. Therefore the first man who stepped in after the agitation of the water became well from whatever affliction he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there who was thirty-eight years in the weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw this man laying down, and knew that he fares now a long time, he says to him, Do thou desire to become well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirmed man answered him, Sir, I have no man so that when the water is agitated he might put me into the pool, but while I am coming another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And straightaway the man became well, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was Sabbath on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is Sabbath. It is not permitted for thee to take up the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, The man who made me well, that man said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Therefore they asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the man who was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus withdrew, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and reported to the Jews that Jesus is the man who made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on a Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Because of this therefore the Jews sought even more to kill him, because not only did he relax the Sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever he may do, the Son also does these things in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him works greater works than these, so that ye may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises up the dead and makes alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>so that all would honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The man not honoring the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, that he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life. And he does not come into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly, I say to you, that an hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And he also gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this, because an hour comes in which all those in the sepulchers will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and will come forth, those who have done right to a resurrection of life, and those who have practiced wrong to a resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can from myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is righteous because I seek not my will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not take the testimony from man. However, I say these things, so that ye may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>That man was the lamp that burns and shines, and ye were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have testimony greater than of John, for the works that the Father has given me so that I might complete them, the same works that I do, they testify about me that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father, he who sent me, has testified about me.Ye have neither heard his voice, nor have ever seen his appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And ye have not his word dwelling in you, because ye do not believe that man whom he sent for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Ye search the scriptures, because ye think to have eternal life in them, and those are testifying about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And ye will not come to me, so that ye may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God within yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father's name, and ye do not accept me. If another man should come in his own name, ye will accept that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can ye believe, who receive glory from each other, and seek not the glory from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. The man who accuses you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for that man wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if ye believe not the writings of that man, how will ye believe my sayings?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went to the other side of the sea of Galilee of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him because they saw his signs, which he did on those who are infirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up onto the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus therefore having lifted up his eyes, and having seen that a great multitude comes to him, he says to Philip, From where will we buy loaves, so that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But he said this testing him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Loaves of two hundred denarii of bread are not sufficient for them, so that each of them may take a little something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is one child here that has five barley loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having expressed thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise also of the fishes as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, so that not anything may be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves that remained over from those who have eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When therefore the men saw what sign Jesus did, they said, This really is the prophet who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Jesus therefore having perceived that they are going to come and seize him, so that they might make him king, departed onto the mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when it became evening his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and having entered into the boat, they were going to the other side of the sea toward Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea was being raised by a great wind blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Therefore having impelled forward about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near to the boat, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he says to them, It is I, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat, and straightaway the boat came to be at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there except that one in which his disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but his</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>and other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord expressed thanks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did thou become here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father put a seal on this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They said to him therefore, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered, and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in that man whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said to him therefore, What sign do thou, that we may see and believe in thee? What do thou work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the TRUE bread out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said to him therefore, Lord, always give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will, no, not hunger, and he who believes in me will, no, not ever thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But also I said to you, that ye have seen me, and yet do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will, no, not cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>Because I have come down from heaven, not so that I might do my will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that he has given me I would not lose from it, but I will raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of him who sent me, that every man who sees the Son, and believes in him, may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews therefore murmured about him because he said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? Therefore how does this man say, I have come down out of heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Every man who hears from the Father, and having learned, comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. This man has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread, having come down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he will live into the age. And also, the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews therefore contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, also he who eats me, that man will also live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He said these things in a synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Therefore many of his disciples having heard, said, This is a hard saying. Who can listen to it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples are grumbling about this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>Then if ye should see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit that makes alive. The flesh benefits nothing. The sayings that I speak to you are spirit, are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>Nevertheless, there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who do not believe, and who he is who will betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, Because of this I have said to you that no man is able to come to me, if it is not given to him from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this, many of his disciples went back at these things, and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do ye not also want to go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter therefore answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? Thou have sayings of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed and know that thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>But he spoke of Judas Iscariot son of Simon. For this man, being one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea so that thy disciples also may see thy works that thou do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no man does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be in public. If thou do these things, show thyself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For not even his brothers believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when his brothers went up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is that man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the multitudes about him. Some said, He is a good man, others said, No, but he leads the multitude astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>Yet no man spoke openly about him because of fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>And when it was now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know scholarly material, not having learned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any man wants to do his will, he will know about the doctrine, whether it is from God, or I speak from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, this man is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law, and none of you does the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The multitude answered and said, Thou have a demon. Who seeks to kill thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on a Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath, so that the law of Moses may not be loosed, are ye angry with me because I made a man entirely well on a Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Therefore some of the Jerusalemites said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And lo, he speaks in public, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers really know that this really is the Christ?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know where I am from? And I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>They sought therefore to seize him, and yet no man laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But many from the crowd believed in him, and they said, When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these that this man did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent subordinates so that they might take him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little time I am with you, and then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where is this man going to go that we will not find him? Is he going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and, Where I am, ye cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus had stood and cried out, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>But he spoke this about the Spirit that those who believe in him were going to receive, for Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Many from the multitude therefore, when they heard the saying, said, This is truly the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, For does the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there became a division among the multitude because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them wanted to taken him, but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The subordinates therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And those men said to them, Why did ye not bring him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The subordinates answered, A man never so spoke like this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees therefore answered them, Have ye not also been led astray?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this multitude that does not know the law are accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus says to them (he who came to him by night, being one of them),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>Does our law judge a man, unless it first may hear from himself and know what he does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered and said to him, Are thou also from Galilee? Search and see, that out of Galilee arises no prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>And each man went to his house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>And at early morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. And having sat down, he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scholars and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery. And having stood her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>tempting, they say to him, Teacher, we found this woman committing adultery, in the act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now in the law, Moses commanded us such women are to be stoned. What therefore do thou say about her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>But they said this, trying him, so that they might have an accusation against him. But Jesus having stooped down, wrote on the ground with his finger, not pretending.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And when they continued asking him, after standing erect, he said to them, Let the innocent man of you first cast the stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And again having stooped down, he wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>And they, having heard and being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, having begun from the elder until the last. And Jesus was left behind alone, and the woman being in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>And Jesus, after standing erect, and having seen no man but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of thee? Did no man condemn thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and henceforth sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me would, no, not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testify about thyself. Thy testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I might testify about myself, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I go, but ye do not know where I come from and where I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>Ye judge according to the flesh. I judge no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>But even if I judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>And also it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am he who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>Jesus spoke these sayings in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no man seized him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Jesus therefore again said to them, I go, and ye will seek me, and ye will die in your sin. Where I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, ye cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>And he said to them, Ye are from below, I am from above. Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>I said therefore to you that ye will die in your sins. For unless ye believe that I am he, ye will die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said therefore to him, Who are thou? And Jesus said to them, The beginning, something that I am even telling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say and to judge about you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world these things that I heard from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that he spoke the Father to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus therefore said to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye will know that I am he, and I do nothing from myself, but I speak these things as my Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do things pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spoke these things of him, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus therefore said to those Jews who believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>and ye will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered to him, We are Abraham's seed, and have been in bondage to no man, ever. How can thou say, Ye will become free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, that every man who does the sin is a bondman of the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>And the bondman does not remain in the house into the age. The Son remains into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If therefore the Son should make you free, ye will truly be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that ye are Abraham's seed, yet ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak what I have seen from my Father, and ye therefore do what ye have seen from your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now ye seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>Ye do the works of your father. They said therefore to him, We were not begotten from fornication. We have one Father, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I came forth and have come from God. For, neither have I come for myself, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do ye not understand my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>Ye are from the father, the devil, and ye want to do the desires of your father. He was a man-killer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>And I, because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts me about sin? And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God hears the sayings of God. Because of this ye do not hear, because ye are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>Therefore the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that thou are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I have no demon, but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>But I seek not my own glory. He is who seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you, if any man keeps my word, he will, no, not see death, into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets, and thou say, If any man keeps my word, he will, no, not taste of death, into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are thou greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who do thou make thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. My Father is he who glorifies me, of whom ye say, He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>And ye do not know him, but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he could see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews therefore said to him, Thou have not yet fifty years, and thou have seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came to be, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Therefore they took up stones so that they might throw at him, but Jesus was hid, and went out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and thus passed on.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>Having said these things, he spat toward the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated, He who has been sent). Therefore he went and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>The neighbors therefore and those who saw him formerly, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who sits and begs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Others said, He is this man, but others said, He is like him. That man said, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They said to him therefore, How were thine eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>That man answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed on my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And after going and washing, I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Therefore they said to him, Where is that man? He says, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought him to the Pharisees--the former blind man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received sight. And he said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath. Other men said, How is a sinful man able to do such signs? And there was division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>They say again to the blind man, What do thou say about him, that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews therefore did not believe about him, that he had been blind, and had received sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>And his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees, we know not. Or who opened his eyes, we know not. He has maturity, ask him. He will speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed him as Christ, he should become excommunicated from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Because of this his parents said, He has maturity, ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So they called the man who was blind, for a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>That man therefore answered and said, If he is sinful, I know not. One thing I know, that being blind, now I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>But again they said to him, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I told you already, and ye did not listen. Why do ye want to hear it again? Do ye not also want to become his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>They reviled him, and said, Thou are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this man, we know not where he is from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man answered and said to them, For in this it is amazing, that ye know not where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>And we know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>From the age, it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered and said to him, Thou were born entirely in sins, and thou teach us. And they cast him outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they cast him outside. And having found him, he said to him, Do thou believe in the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>That man answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>And Jesus said to him, Thou have both seen him, and he is that man who speaks with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>And he affirmed, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, so that those not seeing might see, and those who see might become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we also blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin, but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter in by the door into the fold of the sheep, but goes up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And he departed again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first immersing, and he stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to him, and they said, John indeed did not one sign, but all, as many things as John spoke about this man, were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain Lazarus, from Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>And Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard, he said, This sickness is not about death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When therefore he heard that he is sick, then he actually remained two days in that place he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Later after this he says to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews were now seeking to stone thee, and thou go there again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if any man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He spoke these things, and after this he says to them, Our friend Lazarus has become asleep, but I go that I may awake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples therefore said, Lord, if he has become asleep, he will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus had spoken about his death, but those men thought that he was speaking about the restfulness of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Therefore Jesus then said to them plainly, Lazarus died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Therefore Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when Jesus came, he found him already four days being kept in the sepucher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs away from it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to the women, about Martha and Mary, so that they might console them about their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know even now that as many things as thou may ask of God, God will give to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus says to her, Thy brother will rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha says to him, I know that he will rise in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, even though he died, he will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And every man who lives and believes in me will, no, not die, into the age. Do thou believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She says to him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that thou are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she said these things, she departed and called Mary her sister privately, saying, The teacher is here and calls thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When that woman heard, she rises quickly, and comes to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews therefore being with her in the house and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying that she was going to the sepulcher that she may weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Therefore when Mary came where Jesus was, after seeing him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who gathered with her, weeping, he groaned in the spirit, and was himself troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And he said, Where have ye laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, This man who opened the eyes of the blind man, was he not also able to cause that this man also would not die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the sepulcher. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus says, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of the man who came to end, says to him, Lord, he smells now, for is the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus says to her, Did I not to say thee, that if thou believed, thou will see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone where the man who died was laying. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I had known that thou always hear me, but because of the multitude that stands by I spoke, so that they may believe that thou sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having said these things, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And the man who died came forth, wrapped hands and feet with grave-clothes, and his face had been wrapped around with a face cloth. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and allow him to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and who saw what Jesus did, believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? Because this man does many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we allow him this way, all men will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not the whole nation should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now he said this not from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not for the nation only, but also that he might gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day they consulted together so that they might kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and he stayed there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the countryside before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Therefore they sought Jesus, and spoke with each other as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you? That he will, no, not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now also the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that if any man knew where he is, he should disclose it, so that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Therefore six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, the man who died whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made a supper for him there, and Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those who sat dining with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary therefore, after taking a pound of ointment of very costly genuine spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled of the aroma of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Therefore one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, the man who was going to betray him, says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Now he said this, not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and he had the purse and removed things that were put in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus therefore said, Let her alone. She has keep it for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Therefore a great multitude of the Jews knew that he is there. And they came, not only because of Jesus, but that they might also see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests decided that they should kill Lazarus also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>since because of him many of the Jews were going and were believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow a great multitude having come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord, the King of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Zion. Behold, thy King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>Now his disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these were things written because of him, and they did these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Therefore the multitude, the one that was with him when he called Lazarus from the sepulcher, and raised him from the dead, testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>Also because of this the multitude met him, because they heard of him doing this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye see that ye accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now some Greeks were from those who came up so that they might worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These men therefore came to Philip, the man from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat that falls into the ground dies, it remains alone, but if it dies it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my helper will also be. And if any man serves me, the Father will value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But because of this I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came out of heaven, saying, I both glorified it, and I will glorify again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The multitude therefore that stood by and heard, said thunder occurred, others said, A heavenly agent has spoken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice occurred not for my sake, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>And he said this, signifying by what death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The multitude answered him, We have heard from the law that the Christ remains into the age. And how can thou say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you. And he who walks in the darkness knows not where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the light, believe in the light, so that ye may become sons of light. Jesus spoke these things, and after departing, he was hid from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But although having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>so that the word of Isaiah the prophet that he spoke might be fulfilled: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Because of this they could not believe. Because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes, and has hardened their heart, so that they would not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be turned, and I would heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet, nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess, so that they would not become excommunicated from the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried out and said, He who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come a light into the world, so that every man who believes in me may not remain in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hears my sayings, and will not believe, I do not judge him, for I came not so that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings, has that which judges him: the word that I spoke, that will judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>Because I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore what things I speak, just as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, having seen that his hour has come that he would depart out of this world to his Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And supper having occurred, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, that he would betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, having seen that the Father has given all the things to him, into his hands, and that he came from God, and goes to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>rises from supper, and set his garments aside, and after taking a towel, he girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he pours water into the wash-basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>So he comes to Simon Peter, and that man says to him, Lord, do thou wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou do not know now, but thou will understand after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter says to him, Thou may, no, not wash my feet into the age. Jesus answered him, If I may not wash thee, thou have no part with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus says to him, He who is bathed has no need to wash the feet either, but is entirely clean. And ye are clean, but not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew the man betraying him. Because of this he said, Ye are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>When therefore he washed their feet, and took his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye understand what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord. And ye say well, for I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If I then, the Lord and the teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash each other's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, so that just as I have done to you ye also should do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I speak not about you all. I have seen whom I chose, but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me lifted up his heel against me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Therefore the disciples looked at each other, being uncertain about whom he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>And one of his disciples whom Jesus loved was sitting at Jesus' bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore gestured to this man to inquire whoever he may be about whom he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>And that man, having leaned thus toward Jesus' breast, says to him, Lord, who is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus replies, He is that man to whom I, having dipped the morsel, will give. And when he dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the morsel, then Satan entered into that man. Jesus therefore says to him, What thou do, do more quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>But no man who was sitting knew why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some thought, since Judas had the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>After speaking these things, Jesus went forth with his disciples on the other side of the brook Kidron, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Judas therefore having received the band and subordinates from the chief priests and the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him, after going forth, he says to them, Whom seek ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them, I am he. And Judas, the man betraying him had also stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again therefore he questioned them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, I told you that I am. If therefore ye seek me, allow these men to go,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>so that the word that he spoke might be fulfilled, Of whom thou have given me, I lost, no, not one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's bondman, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, shall I, no, not drink it?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>and led him away first to Annas. For he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Now Caiaphas was the man who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, also the other disciple. But that disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter had stood near the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Therefore the servant girl (the doorkeeper) says to Peter, Are thou not also of this man's disciples? That man says, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now the bondmen and the subordinates had stood, having made a fire of coals because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing with them warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I spoke in public to the world. I always taught in a synagogue, and in the temple where the Jews always gather together, and I spoke nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why question thou me? Question those who have heard what I said to them. Behold, these know the things that I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And when he said these things, one of the subordinates standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, Answer thou the high priest this way?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate therefore said to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted for us to kill any man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he spoke, signifying what kind of death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate therefore again entered into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are thou the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee about me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me. What have thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my subordinates would have fought so that I would not be delivered to the Jews, but now my kingdom is not from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said to him, Then thou a king? Jesus answered, Thou say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Every man who is of the truth hears m</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find not one cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But there is a custom for you that I should release to you one man at the Passover. Do ye wish therefore I would release to you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>They all cried out again therefore, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. But Barabbas was a robber.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And they said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they gave him slaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Therefore Pilate again went forth outside, and says to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, so that ye may know that I find not one cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus therefore came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And he says to them, Look at the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When therefore the chief priests and the subordinates saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Ye take ye him and crucify, for I find no cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was more afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And he went into the Praetorium again, and says to Jesus, Where are thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore says to him, Thou do not speak to me? Know thou not that I have authority to crucify thee, and I have authority to release thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered him, Thou would have no authority against me, unless it were given thee from above. Because of this he who delivered me to thee has greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou are not Caesar's friend. Every man who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard this word, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Look at your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away, away, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Therefore he then delivered him to them, so that he might be crucified, and they took and led Jesus away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he went out bearing his cross to a place called, of a Skull, a place that is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and two others with him, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but, That man said I am king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers therefore when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. But the tunic was a seamless weave, from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not divide it, but cast lots for it, whose it will be, so that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. There</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene had stood near the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then says he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, having seen that all things are now completed, so that the scripture might be fully complete, says, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Therefore a vessel full of vinegar was set there. And having filled a sponge with the vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When therefore Jesus received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and after bowing his head, he gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, since it was Preparation (for it was the high day of that Sabbath), they besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be remove</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers therefore came, and indeed broke the legs of the first, and of the other man who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But having come to Jesus, when they saw him now having died, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and straightaway blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. And that man knows that he speaks true, so that ye may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him will be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, They will look toward whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because of fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might remove the body of Jesus, and Pilate allowed him. Therefore he came and removed the bod</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also came (he who at the first came to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, just as is the custom of the Jews to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now a garden was in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new sepulcher in which no man was yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>Therefore because of the Jews' Preparation (because the sepulcher was near) they laid Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene comes early, while it was still darkness, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Therefore she runs and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two men ran together, and the other disciple ran ahead quicker than Peter and came first to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And after stooping down, he sees the linen cloths lying, yet he entered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter therefore comes following him, and he entered into the sepulcher. And he sees the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the face cloth that was on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped up in one place separately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Therefore then the other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, also entered in, and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For they had not yet known the scripture that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>So the disciples departed again to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary had stood outside near the sepulcher weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped down to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she sees two heavenly agents in white, sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And those men say to her, Woman, why weep thou? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And having said these things, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing. And she had not known that it is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus says to her, Woman, why weep thou? Whom seek thou? That woman, supposing that he is the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou have taken him, tell me where thou have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus says to her, Mary. After turning around, that woman says to him, Rabboni, which says, Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus says to her, Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene comes informing the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he spoke these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Therefore being evening that day, the first day of the week, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were who assembled because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, he showed them his hands and side. His disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And after saying this, he breathed on them, and says to them, Receive ye Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If ye forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If ye retain of any, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I may see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will, no, no</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here, and see my hands, and bring thy hand, and put into my side, and do not become faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus says to him, Because thou have seen me, thou have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And indeed therefore many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written, so that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he revealed himself this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other men of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter says to them, I am going to harvest fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and straightaway entered into the boat. And in that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But having now become morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However the disciples had not seen that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Therefore Jesus says to them, Children, have ye anything eatable? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. Therefore they cast, and they were no longer able to draw it for the magnitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it is the Lord, he tied the coat around himself (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in the skiff (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>So when they came to the land, they saw a fire of coals set, and fish laying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus says to them, Bring from the fishes that ye now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And being so many, the net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus says to them, Come, eat breakfast. And none of the disciples dared to query him, Who are thou? knowing that it is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus therefore comes, and takes the bread, and gives to them, and the fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples after being raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me more than these things? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He says to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He says to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do thou love me? And he said to him, Lord, thou know all things. Thou know that I love thee. Jesus says t</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I say to thee, When thou were younger, thou girded thyself, and walked where thou would, but when thou become old, thou will stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee where thou do not want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he will glorify God. And after saying this, he says to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>But Peter, having turned around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loves, following, who also leaned near his chest at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the man betraying thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Having seen this man, Peter says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus says to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>This saying therefore went forth among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things, as many as Jesus did, which if they would be written every one, I suppose not even the world itself to make room for the books being written. Truly.</verse>
