      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>A book of a genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah begot Perez and Zerah from Tamar, and Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram begot Amminadab, and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon begot Boaz from Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed from Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon from the widow of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah begot Jechoniah and his brothers during the Babylonian exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor begot Zadoc, and Zadoc begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian exile fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way. For his mother Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found having in her womb from Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not wanting to expose her to public disgrace, intended to dismiss her privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he considered these things, behold, an agent of Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take Mary to be thy wife, for that which was begotten in her is from Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name JESUS, for he will save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this has come to pass, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, the virgin will have in her womb, and will bring forth a son. And they will call his name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, being roused from his sleep, did as the agent of Lord ordered him. And he took his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not until she brought forth her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is he who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And Herod the king having heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having gathered together all the chief priests and scholars of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among the rulers of Judah, for out of thee will come forth a man who rules, who will tend my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod having called the wise men privately, ascertained from them what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, After going, search diligently about the child. And when ye find him, report to me, so that I also having come, may worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And when they heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star that they saw in the east went before them until, having come, it stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And having come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down, they worshiped him. And having opened their treasures, they brought to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And divinely warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now after they departed, behold, an agent of Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, After rising, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and thou be there until I tell thee, for Herod is going to seek the child to</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And having awaken, he took the child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And he was there until the end of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was scorned by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and having sent forth, he killed all the boys in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and under, according to the time that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, which says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children. And she did not want to be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod perished, behold, an agent of Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>After rising, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those seeking the child's life have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And having awaken, he took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And having come, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days John the immerser comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens has approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of a man crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather belt about his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region of the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And think not to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed immerse you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He will immerse you in a Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. And he will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be immersed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John was preventing him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and thou come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But having answered, Jesus said to him, Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allows him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And when Jesus was immersed, he went up straightaway out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And after he who tempts came, he said to him, If thou are the Son of God, speak so that these stones may become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But having answered, he said, It is written, Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word coming out through the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and stands him on the pinnacle of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And he says to him, If thou are the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He will command his agents about thee, and, They will take thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, Again it is written, Thou shall not challenge Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil takes him onto an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he says to him, All these things I give thee, if after falling down, thou will worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus says to him, Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shall worship Lord thy God, and him only thou shall serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaves him, and behold, heavenly agents came and served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And having left Nazareth behind, after coming, he dwelt in Capernaum by the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who dwell in darkness saw a great light, and to those who dwell in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens has approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he says to them, Come behind me, and I will make you fishermen of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And straightaway having left the nets, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having gone on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And straightaway having left the boat and their father, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went around all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good-news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went forth into all Syria. And they brought to him all those faring badly with various diseases, and gripped with pain, and being demon-possessed, and being lunatic, and paralyzed. And he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And many multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan followed him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And having seen the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. And when he sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed are the poor in spirit, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are those who mourn, because they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful, because they will obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are those who have been persecuted because of righteousness, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye when they revile you, and persecute you, and say every evil word, being deceitful against you because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, because your reward is great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye are the salt material of the earth. But if the salt material becomes ineffective, by what will it be salted? It is potent for nothing further, except to be cast outside and to be trodden down by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye are the light of the world. A city setting on a hill cannot be hid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus your light should shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I came to abolish the law or the prophets. I came not to abolish, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I say to you, until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle will, no, not pass away from the law, until all things come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore may relax one of these least commandments, and may teach men so, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens. But whoever may do and may teach them, this man will be called great in the kingdom of the he</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness abounds more than of the scholars and Pharisees, ye will, no, not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, that every man who is angry at his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment, and whoever speaks an insult to his brother will be liable to the council, and whoever says, Foolish man, will be liable to</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore thou should bring thy gift to the altar, and remember there that thy brother has anything against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to thy brother, and then, after coming, bring thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be agreeing with thine opponent quickly, while thou are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the subordinate, and thou will be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I say to thee, thou will, no, not come out from there, until thou have paid the last quadran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that every man who looks on a woman to crave her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if thy right eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand causes thee to stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>And it was said, Whoever may divorce his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife apart from a matter of fornication, disposes her to commit adultery, and whoever may marry her who has been divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not swear falsely, but shall render to the Lord thine oaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shall thou swear by thy head, because thou cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be, Yes, yes, No, no. And anything beyond these is from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, not to resist what is troublesome, but whoever will strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And to the man who wants to sue thee, and take away thy coat, thou shall leave him thy cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever will draft thee for one mile, go thou with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asks thee, and turn thou not away from him who wants to borrow from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>so that ye may become sons of your Father in the heavens, because he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and makes rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the tax collectors the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if ye only greet your friends, what do ye extra? Do not even the tax collectors this way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Ye therefore shall be perfect, even as your Father in the heavens is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Be careful not to do your charity before men in order to be seen by them, otherwise ye have no reward from your Father in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>When therefore thou do charity, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when thou do charity, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that thy charity may be in secret. And thy Father who sees in secret will himself reward thee in the open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when thou pray, thou shall not be as the hypocrites, because they love to pray having stood in the synagogues and in the corners of the thoroughfares, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But thou, when thou pray, enter into thy private room, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee in the open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And while praying do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they will be heard by their much speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Be not therefore like them, for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Pray ye therefore this way: Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>May thy kingdom come. May thy will happen on the earth as also in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day the bread sufficient for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, because from thee is the kingdom and the power and the glory into the ages. Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>And when ye fast, become not like the gloomy looking hypocrites, for they make their faces unsightly, so that they may appear fasting to men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>so that thou may not appear fasting to men, but to thy Father in secret. And thy Father, who sees in secret, will reward thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye is sound, thy whole body will be bright.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Because of this I say to you, be not anxious about your life, what ye may eat, or what ye may drink, nor yet for your body, what ye may wear. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look to the birds of the sky, because they sow not, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not more valuable then they?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are ye anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, nor do they spin,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Be not therefore anxious, saying, What may we eat? or, What may we drink? or, What may we wear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that ye need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow will be anxious about things of itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you, that many will come from east and west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>Which indeed is smaller than all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so as for the birds of the sky to come and lodge in the branches of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>He spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes, and he did not speak to them independent of a parable,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of man will send forth his agents, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those doing lawlessness,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man having found, he hid. And from the joy of it, he goes and sells all, as many things as he has, and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>But of him not having to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all things, as many as he had, and payment to be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>The bondman therefore having fallen down, worshiped him, saying, Lord, be patient toward me and I will pay thee all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>And having felt compassion, the lord of that bondman released him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But after going out, that bondman found one of his fellow bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having grabbed him, he choked him, saying, Pay me if thou owe anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>So his fellow bondman having fallen down at his feet, besought him, saying, Be patience toward me, and I will pay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he would not, instead, having left him, he cast him into prison until he would pay that which was owed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>And when his fellow bondmen saw the things that happened, they were extremely sorry. And after coming, they reported to their lord all the things that happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord having summoned him, he says to him, Thou evil bondman, I forgave thee all that debt because thou besought me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Was it not necessary for thee also to be merciful to thy fellow bondman, as I also was merciful to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And having become angry, his lord delivered him to the tormentors until he would pay all that was due to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye do not forgive each man his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus knowing it, he said to them, Why do ye cause troubles to the woman? For she has wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For by pouring this ointment upon my body, she did it for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly I say to you, wherever this good-news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman did will also be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>he said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty silver pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought a favorable opportunity so that he might betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do thou want that we should prepare for thee to eat the Passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And he said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near. I keep the Passover with my disciples with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus arranged for them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>Now having become evening, he was sitting with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And being exceedingly sorrowful, they began, each of them, to say to him, Is it I, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And having answered, he said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, this man will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him if that man had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas (the man who betrayed him) having answered, he said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, Thou have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, having expressed thanks, broke in pieces, and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And having taken the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, saying, All ye drink of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed on behalf of many for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will, no, not drink of this fruit of the grapevine henceforth until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me in this night, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But having answered, Peter said to him, If all men will be caused to stumble by thee, I will never be caused to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, that in this night, before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter says to him, Even if I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And likewise also, said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until, after going, I may pray there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then Jesus says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, as far as of death. Remain ye here and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, may this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I want, but as thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, So ye could not watch with me one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Having gone again a second time, he prayed, saying, My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me, except I drink it, may thy will happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And having come again, he finds them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And when he left them, having gone away again, he prayed a third time, saying again the same statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he comes to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep what remains, and take rest...Behold, the hour has come near, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Awake, we go. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was still speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priest and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the man who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And straightaway having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are thou here. Then having come, they threw their hands on Jesus, and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus, having stretched out a hand, drew his sword, and when he struck the bondman of the high priest, he cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus says to him, Return thy sword into its place, for all those who take a sword will die by a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do thou think that I cannot now call my Father, and he will provide to me more than twelve legions of agents?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it is necessary to happen this way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Did ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has come to pass, so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, having forsook him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And those who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scholars and the elders were assembled together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him from afar, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And having entered inside, he sat with the subordinates to see the outcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the elders and the whole council sought FALSE testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and they did not find it. And although many FALSE witnesses came, they did not find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>But finally two FALSE witnesses having come, they said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it by three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest having stood up, he said to him, Answer thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And having responded, the high priest said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou are the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus says to him, Thou have said. Nevertheless I say to you, Henceforth ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed. What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What does it seem to you? Having answered, they said, He is deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face and struck him with a fist. And some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ. Who is he who struck thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant girl came to him, saying, Thou also were with Jesus the Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before them all, saying, I do not know what thou say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he was gone out into the porch, another woman saw him, and says to them there, This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little while those who stood, having approached, said to Peter, Surely thou also are of them, for thy accent even makes thee apparent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse vehemently and to swear, I do not know the man. And straightaway a cock sounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice. And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>But having become morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people held consultation against Jesus in order to condemn him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And having bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who betrayed him, after seeing that he was condemned, having repented, he brought back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, I sinned, having betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is it to us? See thou to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And having cast down the silver pieces in the temple, he departed, and after going away, he hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And after taking the silver pieces, the chief priests said, It is not permitted to put them into the treasury, since it is a price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And having held consultation, they bought the potter's field with them for burial for foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field was called the field of blood, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, which says, And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of him who was valued, whom they valued from the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter's field, as Lord appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate says to him, Do thou not hear how many things they testify against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he did not answer him, not even one word, so as for the governor to marvel greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now during a feast the governor had been accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do ye want I should release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they delivered him up because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, There is nothing for thee and that righteous man. For I suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>Now the governor having answered, he said to them, Which of the two do ye want I would release to you? And they said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, He should be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And the governor said, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, saying, He should be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather an uproar was developing, after taking water, he washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. See ye to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And having answered, all the people said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus he delivered him so that he would be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered the whole band to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And having stripped him, they put a scarlet robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And having woven a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And having knelt down before him, they ridiculed him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And having spat upon him, they took the reed and were striking him on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And after they ridiculed him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And while coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They drafted this man, so that he might take his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called, the place of a skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall. And having tasted it, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And as they sat, they keep watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two robbers are crucified with him, one at the right hand and one at the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, Thou who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>And likewise also the chief priests, ridiculing with the scholars, and elders, and Pharisees, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others, he cannot save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God, let him rescue him now, if he wants him, for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And also the robbers who were crucified with him reviled him the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour darkness developed over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And straightaway one of them, after running, and having taken a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the others said, Leave thou be. We might see if Elijah comes he will save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus, having cried out again in a great voice, yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks split,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the sanctified who have been asleep arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>And having come forth out of the sepulchers after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion, and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And many women were there watching from afar, who followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And having become evening, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man having come to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph having taken the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his own new sepulcher, which he hewed out in the rock. And having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the morrow, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was still alive, After three days I am raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples having come by night steal him away, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead. And the last error will be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, Ye have security. Go, make it as secure as ye know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>And having gone, they made the tomb secure, with the security having sealed the stone.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now late on the Sabbath day, being dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, a great earthquake occurred, for an agent of Lord, having descended from heaven, having come, he rolled the stone away from the door and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>And his appearance was as lightning and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And those watching over shook from fear of him, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And having responded, the agent said to the women, Fear ye not, for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he was raised as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And after going quickly, tell his disciples, He was raised from the dead, and lo, he goes before you into Galilee. There ye will see him. Behold, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And after coming out quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy, they ran to notify his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail. And having come, they held his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus says to them, Fear not. Go notify my brothers that they should depart into Galilee, and there they will see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the security having come into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things that happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And after assembling with the elders, and having taken consultation, they gave many silver pieces to the soldiers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>Say ye, His disciples, having come by night, stole him from us while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this should be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and will make you worry free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>And having taken the silver pieces, they did as they were instructed. And this saying was spread abroad among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went for Galilee to the mountain where Jesus arranged for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but men doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus having come, he spoke to them, saying, All authority in heaven and on earth was given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>After going, make ye disciples of all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all things, as many as I commanded you. And lo, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age. Truly.</verse>
