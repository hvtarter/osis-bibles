      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and he who holds the scepter from the house of Eden, and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon. And I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says lord LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pity. And his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>But I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces of it, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his rulers together, says LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth, and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will kill all the rulers of it with him, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have rejected the law of LORD, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, accord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus says LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have sold a righteous man for silver, and a needy man for a pair of shoes--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>those who pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek. And a man and his father go to the [same] maiden, to profane my holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge. And in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks, yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye sons of Israel? says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Do not Prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I will press [you] in your place, as a cart presses that is full of sheaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, nor shall the mighty deliver himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>Neither shall he stand who handles the bow. And he who is swift of foot shall not deliver [himself], nor shall he who rides the horse deliver himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>And he who is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this word that LORD has spoken against you, O sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only I have known of all the families of the earth. Therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Shall two walk together unless they have agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has taken nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no net is [set] for him? Shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall evil befall a city, and LORD has not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely lord LORD will do nothing unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion has roared, who will not fear? Lord LORD has spoken, who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are in it, and what oppressions are in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they do not know to do right, says LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore thus says lord LORD: An adversary [shall be], even round about the land, and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus says LORD: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, says lord LORD, the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will smite the winter house with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, says LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, ye cows of Bashan, who are in the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>Lord LORD has sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And ye shall go out at the breaches, each one straight before her, and ye shall cast [yourselves] into Harmon, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Bethel and transgress, to Gilgal [and] multiply transgression. And bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes every three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings, and publish them. For this pleases you, O ye sons of Israel, says lord LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet ye have not returned to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And I also have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest. And I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city. One piece was rained upon, and the piece upon which it</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied. Yet ye have not returned to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew. The multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees the palmer-worm has devoured. Yet ye have not returned to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent among you the pestilence according to the manner of Egypt. I have slain your young men with the sword, and have carried away your horses, and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils. Yet y</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown [cities] among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning. Yet ye have not returned to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus I will do to thee, O Israel, [and] because I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, lo, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, who makes the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth--LORD, the God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise. She is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says lord LORD: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus says LORD to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba. For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to naught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek LORD, and ye shall live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>[seek him] who makes the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night, who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth (LORD is his name),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>who brings sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Inasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions of wheat from him. Ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them. Ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins--ye who afflict the just man, who take a bribe, and who turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore he who is prudent shall keep silence in such a time, for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live, and so LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore thus says LORD, the God of hosts, LORD: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways. And they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And in all vineyards shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of thee, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to you who desire the day of LORD! Why would ye have the day of LORD? It is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him, or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Shall not the day of LORD be darkness, and not light, even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Did ye bring sacrifices and offerings to me in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan (LXX/NT), your images which ye made to yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass ye to Calneh, and see, and from there go ye to Hamath the great, then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms? Or is their border greater than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>Ye who put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>who lay upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>who sing idle songs to the sound of the viol, who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils, but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore they shall now go captive with the first who go captive, and the revelry of those who stretched themselves shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>Lord LORD has sworn by himself, says LORD, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces, therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And when a man's uncle shall take him up, even he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to him who is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No, then he sh</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, LORD commands, and the great house shall be smitten with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run upon the rock? Will [a man] plow [there] with oxen? That ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>ye who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, says LORD, the God of hosts, and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus lord LORD showed me: And, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth, and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O lord LORD, forgive, I beseech thee. How shall Jacob stand, for he is small?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>LORD relented concerning this. It shall not be, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus lord LORD showed me: And, behold, lord LORD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then I said, O lord LORD, cease, I beseech thee. How shall Jacob stand, for he is small?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>LORD relented concerning this. This also shall not be, says lord LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed me: And, behold, LORD stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And LORD said to me, Amos, what do thou see? And I said, A plumb-line. Then LORD said, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also Amaziah said to Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But do not prophesy again any more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, nor was I a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>And LORD took me from following the flock, and LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now therefore hear thou the word of LORD: Thou say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop [thy word] against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus says LORD: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line, and thou thyself shall die in a land that is unclean. And Israel shall</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>Thus lord LORD showed me: And, behold, a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And he said, Amos, what do thou see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then LORD said to me, The end has come upon my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, says lord LORD. The dead bodies shall be many. In every place they shall cast them forth with silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, O ye who would swallow up a needy man, and cause the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.6'>that we may buy the poor for silver, and a needy man for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</verse>
