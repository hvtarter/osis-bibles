      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the congregation of God that is at Corinth, with all the sanctified who are in the whole of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all encouragement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who encourages us in all our affliction, in order for us to be able to encourage those in every affliction, through the encouragement of which we ourselves are encouraged by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>Because, as the sufferings of the Christ abound to us, so also our encouragement abounds through the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But whether we are oppressed, it is for your encouragement and salvation, which works by endurance from the same sufferings that we also experience (and our hope for you is steadfast), or we are encouraged, it is for your encourage</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our affliction that happened to us in Asia, because we were extraordinarily weighed down, above strength, so as for us to despair even to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we should not be trusting in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who rescued us out of so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we have hoped that he will also still rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>And of you who help together by supplication for us (a gift for us from many persons, because of many), so that there may be gratitude about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our pride is this (the testimony from our conscience), that we behave in the world in the simplicity and purity of God, not by fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other thing to you, but rather what ye read or also acknowledge. And I hope ye will also acknowledge until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>as also ye did acknowledge us in part, because we are your boast, just as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, so that ye might have a second benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and to pass through you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be helped on the way toward Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore intending this, did I accordingly employ anything in lightness? Or what I decide, do I decide according to flesh, so that it would be with me the yes, yes and the no, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But God is faithful, because our word toward you became not, yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was proclaimed among you by us (by me and Silvanus and Timothy) became not, yes and no, but in him has become, yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For as many as be promises of God, in him is the Yes, and in him the Truly, for glory to God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who anointed us, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>He also is who put a seal on us, and who gave the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that I did not yet come to Corinth, sparing you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not because we lord over your faith, but are co-workmen of your joy, for by faith ye stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this in myself, not to come again to you in sadness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sad, who then is he who makes me glad except he who is made sad by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this same thing to you, so that when I came, I would not have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, having been confident toward you all, because my joy is of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much stress and dismay of heart, through many tears, I wrote to you, not that ye would be grieved, but that ye might know the love that I have so much more for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any man has caused sadness, he has not caused me sadness, but in part (that I may not bear down) you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment by the many,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that instead, for you rather to forgive and encourage, lest perhaps such a man would be swallowed up with too much sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I beseech you to affirm love for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For I also wrote for this, so that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>But to whom ye forgive anything, I too. For I also, whom I have forgiven (if anything), I have forgiven because of you in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>so that we may not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his methods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now having come to Troas for the good-news of the Christ, and a door having been opened to me in Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, my not finding Titus my brother. But having departed from them, I went forth into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>And thanks is to God who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and who makes manifest the aroma of the knowledge of him in every place, through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>Because we are a fragrance of Christ to God, in those being saved and in those perishing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to the one an odor of death for death, and to the other an aroma of life for life. And who is adequate for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as other men, huckstering the word of God, but as from purity. But we speak in Christ as from God in the sight of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Unless we need, as some men, commendatory letters to you or commendatory from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being seen that ye are a letter of Christ, administered by us, written not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, not in stony tablets, but in fleshly tablets, in hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And we have such confidence toward God through Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also made us qualified helpers of a new covenant, not of a document, but of a spirit, for the document kills but the spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the administration of death in writings engraved on stones occurred in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze upon the face of Moses because of the fading glory of his countenance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will the administration of the spirit not be more in glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the administration of condemnation has glory, the administration of righteousness excels much more in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For also that which has been glorified, has not been glorified in this regard, because of the glory that transcends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is abolished was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore such a hope we use great boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and are not as Moses. He put a veil over his face in order for the sons of Israel not to gaze on the end of the fading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old testament, not being uncovered, which thing is abolished in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But to this day when Moses is read, a veil lays upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But whenever it turns to Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with unveiled face seeing by reflection the glory of Lord, are transformed into the same likeness from glory to glory, just as from the Spirit of Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Because of this (having this ministry), in as much as we received mercy, we do not become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have renounced the covert things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor misrepresenting the word of God, but by the disclosure of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But even if our good-news is concealed, it is concealed in those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, in order for the light of the good-news of the glory of the Christ (who is a likeness of God) not to shine forth to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves are your bondmen through Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Because it is God who said, Out of darkness light is to shine, who shone in our hearts for an enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>restricted in everything, yet not confined, perplexed but not despairing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>Always carrying around in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So death indeed works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace, which has multiplied because of the thankfulness of the many, may abound for the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we are not discouraged, but even if the outer man of us is perishing, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our slight momentary affliction works for us an eternal weight of glory from extraordinariness to extraordinariness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we look not at things seen, but at things not seen. For things seen are temporal, but things not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if the earthly house of our tent were destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For also in this we groan, longing to clothe ourselves with our habitation from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed also having put it on we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For also those who are in the tent groan, being burdened, not in that we want to undress, but to clothe ourselves, so that the mortal may be swallowed up by the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he who wrought us for this same thing is God, who also gave us the pledge of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore always being confident, and knowing that while at home in the body we are absent from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>for we walk by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>And we are confident, and are pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be at home near the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore also we aspire, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of the Christ, so that each man may receive back about the things that he did through the body, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Having seen therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. But we have been manifested to God, and I hope also to have been manifested in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we are not commending ourselves again to you, but giving you an opportunity of boasting about us, so that ye may have for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For whether we are beside ourselves to God, or we are of normal mind, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ holds us together, having judge this, that if one died for all, then all died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And he died for all so that those who live would no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and was raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that henceforth we know no man according to flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>So then if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>How that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We are therefore, ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were calling through us. We plead on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For the man who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>And working jointly, we urge you also not to receive the grace of God in vain</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(for he says, At an acceptable time I heard thee, and in a day of salvation I helped thee. Behold, now is an acceptable time. Behold, now is a day of salvation),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>giving not one cause of stumbling in anything, so that the ministry may not be criticized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves as helpers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in necessities, in restrictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hungerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in Holy Spirit, in non-hypocritical love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in word of truth, in power of God, through the weapons of righteousness of the right hand and of the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and disrepute, through slander and commendation; as deceitful, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as grieving, but always rejoicing; as poor, but making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians, our mouth has been opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>Ye are not limited in us, but ye are limited in your bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>But I speak the same recompense as to children, be ye also enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what share have believers with non-believers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what mutual agreement has a temple of God with idols? For ye are a temple of the living God, just as God said, I will dwell in them, and will walk among them. And I will be their God, and they will be a people to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore, Come ye out from among them, and be ye separated, says Lord, And touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and will be for a Father to you, and ye will be for sons and daughters to me, says Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Make room for us. We wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we exploited no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not for condemnation, for I have said before that ye are in our hearts to die together and to live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my boldness toward you, great is my pride for you. I have been filled with encouragement. I over-abound with joy in all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had not one relief, but being oppressed in everything: battles outside, fears within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless God, who encourages the lowly, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>And not only by his presence, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you, reporting to us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Because even though I grieved you in the letter, I am not remorseful (even though I was remorseful), for I perceive that that letter grieved you, even though for an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved for repentance. For ye were grieved toward God, so that ye might suffer loss from us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For sorrow toward God works repentance for salvation without regret, but the sorrow of the world works death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold this same thing--your grieving toward God. How much eagerness it worked in you, even a defense, even indignation, even fear, even longing, even zeal, even vengeance! In everything ye demonstrated yourselves to be pure in</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>And so then although I wrote to you, it was not because of the man who did wrong, nor because of the man who was wronged, but in order to reveal to you your eagerness for us in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Because of this we have been encouraged. And from your encouragement, we rejoiced to a greater degree more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because, if I have boasted anything to him about you, I am not ashamed, but as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boast to Titus became truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his bowels are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>And, brothers, we declare to you the grace of God that has been given in the congregations of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy, even from the depth of their poverty, abounded for the wealth of their generosity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>so that according to their ability, I testify, and beyond their ability, willingly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>with much exhortation, begging of us the favor, even the fellowship of service for the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And it was not as we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>for us to urge Titus that, as he earlier began this kindness, so he would even finish it for you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, be that ye may also abound in this kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not from commandment, but because of the zeal of others, also examining the genuineness of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich he became poor for your sakes, so that by that man's poverty ye might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give judgment, for this is expedient for you who earlier began, from a year ago, not only the doing but also the intending.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>And now also finish the doing, so that just as was the willingness of the intending, so also to finish from the having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the willingness is present, it is acceptable to the extent if some man has, not to the extent he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For it is not, so that ease is for others and stress for you, but out of parity your abundance at the present time is for the need of those men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>So that the abundance of those men may also happen for your need, so that there may become equity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>as it is written, he of much did not abound, and he of little did not lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks to God who gives the same eagerness for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>Because he indeed accepted the exhortation, but his own will being more zealous, he went forth to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we sent along with him the brother whose praise in the good-news is throughout all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations, a traveling companion of us with this gift administered by us, for the glory of the same Lord and our willingness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>Arranging this lest any man may criticize us in this bounty administered by us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>providing things right, not only in the sight of Lord, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we sent along with them our brother whom we often proved being diligent in many things, but is now much more diligent (with much confidence toward you)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>whether on behalf of Titus my partner and co-workman for you, or our brothers, apostles of congregations, a glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show ye the proof of your love and our boast about you, for them in the face of the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For indeed it is superfluous for me to write to you about the service for the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your willingness, which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from a year ago. And your zeal provoked the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I sent the brothers so that our boast about you would not be empty in this regard. So that, as I said, ye may be prepared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>if somehow Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we might not say, ye) would be embarrassed in this confidence of boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go ahead to you, and arrange in advance your gift that was earlier announced, for this to be ready this way as a gift and not as an exaction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows in blessings will also reap in blessings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Each man as he purposes in his heart, not from regret or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to abound all grace for you, so that always in everything having all sufficiency, ye may abound for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>as it is written, He has scattered abroad. He has given to the poor. His righteousness endures into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>And he who supplies seed to the man who sows, and bread for eating, may he supply and multiply your seed, and may he increase the fruits of your righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>being enriched in everything for every generosity, which works gratitude to God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>Because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the sanctified, but also abounding through many thanksgivings to God</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>through the evidence of this service, glorifying God at the subjection of your confession toward the good-news of the Christ, and at the generosity of the participation, for them and for all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and by their supplication about you, yearning for you because of the transcending grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>And thanks to God for his indescribable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who indeed am lowly in presence among you, but am bold toward you when absent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I pray not to be bold when present with the confidence by which I consider to be valiant toward some who consider us as walking according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty in God for the demolition of strongholds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>casting down imaginations, and every high thing exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought captive into the obedience of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and having in readiness to avenge every disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do ye look at things according to appearance. If any man has convinced himself to be of Christ, let him consider this again of himself, that, as he is of Christ, so also are we of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I also should boast somewhat more abundantly about our authority (which the Lord gave us for building up, and not for tearing you down), I will not be shamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>so that I would not seem as if to terrify you by the letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>Because, The letters, he says, are indeed weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is disdained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a man think this, that such kind we are in word by letters when absent, we are also such kind when present in the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not classify or compare ourselves to some of those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast in things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the standard that God apportioned to us, of a measure to reach even as far as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For it is not as not reaching for you. We overextend ourselves. For we even reached as far as you in the good-news of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting in things immeasurable, in other men's labors, but having hope of your faith growing in you to be enlarged according to our measure for abundance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>in order to preach the good-news beyond you, not to boast in another measure, in things prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he who boasts should boast in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For he who commends himself, that man is not approved, but whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>O that ye tolerated a little of my foolishness, but tolerate me too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous for you with a jealousy of God. For I betrothed you to one husband, a pure virgin to present to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent enticed Eve by his craftiness, so your thoughts might be corrupted from the simplicity in the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For indeed if a man who comes, preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or ye receive another spirit that ye did not receive, or another good-news that ye did not accept, ye well tolerated it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I reckon to come short in nothing of those, superlative apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything made known in all things to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit a sin lowering myself so that ye might be lifted up, because I preached to you the good-news of God freely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other congregations, having taken a wage in order for your service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And being present with you, and when needy, I was a burden to no man. For the brothers who came from Macedonia, they supplied my need. And in everything I kept, and I will keep myself non-burdensome to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>The truth of Christ is in me that this pride in me will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, I also will do, so that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast, they might appear just as we also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such men are FALSE apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no marvel, for even Satan disguises himself into an agent of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore, it is no great thing if his helpers also disguise themselves as helpers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, let not any man think me to be foolish, but if otherwise--even if as foolish--accept me, so that I also may boast some a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I speak not according to Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of the boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For being wise, ye gladly tolerate the foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For ye tolerate it if some man enslaves you, if some man devours you, if some man seizes you, if some man lifts himself up, if some man strikes you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak as from shame, that we were so weak. Yet in whatever any man may be bold in foolishness, I say I too am bold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? I too. Are they Israelites? I too. Are they a seed of Abraham? I too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they helpers of Christ? (I speak as being mad) I more: in toils, more abundantly; in stripes, countless; in prisons, more frequently; in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>From the Jews five times I received forty save one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I was shipwrecked, I have done a night and a day in the depth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>in frequent journeys, in perils of flowing waters, in perils of bandits, in perils from my race, in perils from Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils at sea, in perils among FALSE brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in toil and hardship, in frequent sleeplessness, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fasts, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Besides the external things, crowding upon me daily is the care of all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I am not made fiery?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If it is necessary to boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed into the ages, knows that I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes wanting to apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>And I was lowered in a hamper through a window through the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>(Really, to me boasting is not helpful.) For I will come to visions and revelations of Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in body, I know not, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows) such a man was caught up as far as the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man (whether in body, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up into the paradise, and heard inexpressible sayings that are not permitted for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>For such a man I will boast, but for myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I should want to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain lest any man should reckon to me above what he sees of me or hears anything from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And so that I might not be over exalted by the extraordinariness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an agent of Satan so that he would buffet me, so that I would not be over exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>I besought the Lord thrice about this, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made fully perfect in weakness. More gladly therefore I will boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of the Christ may reside in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in restrictions, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become foolish, boasting. Ye compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I came short in nothing of those, superlative apostles, even though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Indeed the signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is there which ye were inferior to the other congregations? Except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, a third time I fare readily to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not the things of you, but you. For the children ought not lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I most gladly will spend, and will be spent for your souls. Even though more earnestly loving you, the worse I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But let it be. I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being clever, I caught you with bait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Any man of whom I have sent to you, did I exploit you through him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I encouraged Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in anything? Did we not walk in the same spirit, not in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do ye think that we are making defense to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear lest somehow, having come, I may find you not such as I want, and I may be found by you such as ye do not want, lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, wraths, selfish ambitions, slanderings, whisperings, puffings up, t</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest having come again my God will make me low toward you, and I will bewail many of those who have sinned previously, and who did not repent from the trash and fornication and licentiousness that they committed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two witnesses or three every saying will be confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have told you before, and I say in advance, as present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I come to it again, I will not spare,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since ye seek proof of the Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For even if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from the power of God. For we in him are also weak, but we will live with him from the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are test-failing something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I hope that ye will know that we are not test-failing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God, to do you nothing harmful, not that we would appear test-passing, but that ye would do right, even like we might be test-failing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we do not have any power against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, your full qualification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Because of this I write these things while absent, so that I may not act harshly when present, according to the authority that the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally brothers, farewell. Be thoroughly prepared, be encouraged, think the same way, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Salute each other by a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the sanctified salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, is with all of you. Truly.</verse>
