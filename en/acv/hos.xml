      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of LORD that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When LORD spoke at the first by Hosea, LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom, departing from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And [LORD] said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>And [LORD] said, Call his name Lo-ammi, for ye are not my people, and I will not be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said to them, Th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye to your brothers, Ammi, and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your mother. Contend, for she is not my wife, nor am I her husband. And let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>Yea, I will have no mercy upon her sons, for they are sons of whoredom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>for their mother has played the harlot. She who conceived them has done shamefully, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore I will take back my grain in the time of it, and my new wine in the season of it, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, to which she burned incense when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak soothingly to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be at that day, says LORD, that thou shall call me Ishi, and shall no more call me Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth thee to me forever. Yea, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness, and thou shall know LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, says LORD. I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her to me in the earth. And I will have mercy upon her who had not obtained mercy. And I will say to those who were not my people, Thou are my people, and they shall say, My God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And LORD said to me, Go again, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, and an adulteress, even as LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>And I said to her, Thou shall abide for me many days. Thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shall not be any man's wife. So I will also be toward thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the sons of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek LORD their God and David their king, and shall come with fear to LORD and to his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of LORD, ye sons of Israel, for LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>There is nothing but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery. They break out, and blood touches blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone who dwells in it shall languish with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens. Yea, the fishes of the sea shall also be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet, let no man strive, nor let any man reprove, for thy people are as those who strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>And thou shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night. And I will destroy thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because thou have rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee, that thou shall be no priest to me. Since thou have forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And it shall be, like people, like priest. And I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>And they shall eat, and not have enough. They shall play the harlot, and shall not increase, because they have left off taking heed to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them, for the spirit of whoredom has caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, [departing] from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow of it is good. Therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes. And the people who do not understand shall be ove</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend, and come not ye to Gilgal, nor go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. Now LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink has become sour. They play the harlot continually. Her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings, and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for to you pertains the judgment. For ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And the revolters have gone deep in making slaughter, but I am a rebuker of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me. For now, O Ephraim, thou have played the harlot; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God, for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they do not know LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah also shall stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek LORD, but they shall not find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against LORD, for they have borne strange sons. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven, behind thee, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke. I have made known that which shall surely be among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The rulers of Judah are like those who remove the landmark. I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed. He is crushed in judgment, because he was content to walk after [man's] command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore I am to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb. But he is not able to heal you, nor will he cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away, I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return to LORD, for he has torn, and he will heal us. He has smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>And let us know, let us follow on to know LORD. His going forth is sure as the morning, and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes away early.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore I have hewed them by the prophets. I have slain them by the words of my mouth. And thy judgments are [as] the light that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant. There they have dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem. Yea, they have committed iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. Whoredom is there in Ephraim; Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee when I bring back the captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria. For they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the troop of robbers ravages outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own doings have surrounded them; they are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the rulers with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers. They are as an oven heated by the baker. He ceases to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>On the day of our king the rulers made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He stretched out his hand with scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made their heart ready like an oven, while they lay in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings are fallen. There is none among those who call to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know. Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he does not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Yet they have not returned to LORD their God, nor sought him for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them. I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They rebel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they devise mischief against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not to [him] on high. They are like a deceitful bow. Their rulers shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>[Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle [he comes] against the house of LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They shall cry to me, My God, we, Israel know thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off that which is good. The enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me. They have made rulers, and I knew it not. They have made themselves idols of their silver and their gold, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>He has cast off thy calf, O Samaria. MY anger is kindled against them. How long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For even this is from Israel: the workman made it, and it is no God. Yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. He has no standing grain. The blade shall yield no meal. If so be it yields, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which no man delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria [like] a wild donkey alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yea, though they hire among the nations, I will now gather them, and they shall begin to be diminished because of the burden of the king of rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law, but they are counted as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it, but LORD does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. They shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his maker, and built palaces. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy like the peoples, for thou have played the harlot, [departing] from thy God. Thou have loved hire upon every grain-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in LORD's land, but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not pour out wine-offerings to LORD, nor shall they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners. All who eat of it shall be polluted, for their bread shall be for their appetite. It sha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, lo, they have gone away from destruction, [yet] Egypt shall gather them up. Memphis shall bury them. Their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them. Thorns shall be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation have come. The days of recompense have come. Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God. As for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will visit their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season. But they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that w</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird. There shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.12'>Though they bring up their sons, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.10.11'>And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loves to tread out [the grain]. But I have passed over upon her fair neck. I will set a rider on Ephraim. Judah shall plow. Jacob shall break his clods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.12'>Sow to yourselves in righteousness. Reap according to kindness. Break up your fallow ground, for it is time to seek LORD, till he comes and rains righteousness upon you.</verse>
