      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are indebted to thank God always about you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is increasing greatly, and the love of each one of you all toward each other abounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>So as for us ourselves to have pride in you in the congregations of God, for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the tribulations that ye endure,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>being evidence of the righteous judgment of God, for you to be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also ye suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>Since it is a righteous thing according to God to repay restriction to those who restrict you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and relief with us, to you who are restricted, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his agents of power</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>in a fire of flame rendering vengeance to those who have not known God, and to those not obeying the good-news of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>Men who will suffer punishment, a penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he comes to be glorified in his sanctified, and to be marveled in that day by all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>For which also we pray always about you, so that our God will make you worthy of the calling, and will fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we ask you, brothers, on behalf of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>for ye not to be quickly shaken from your mind, nor to be alarmed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by a letter as by us, as that the day of the Christ has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let not any man deceive you in any way, because if not, the defection may come first, and he may be revealed--the man of sin, the son of destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or an object of worship, so as for him to sit in the temple of God, as God, displaying himself that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do ye not remember that when I was yet with you I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now ye know that which restrains, for him to be revealed in his own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only he who restrains it until now will develop from the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the lawless will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth, and will neutralize at the appearance of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>Whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and marvels of deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and in all deception of unrighteousness in those who are perishing, in return for which, they did not accept the love of the truth in order for them to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And because of this God will send them the force of a delusion, for them to believe a lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>so that they might be condemned--all those who did not believe the truth, but who delighted in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are indebted to express thanks to God always about you, brothers, beloved by Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation, in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>for which he called you, through our good-news, for an acquired possession of glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that ye were taught, whether by word or by letter from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father who loved us and gave eternal encouragement and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brothers, pray about us, so that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as also with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from aberrant and wicked men, for the faith is not of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and will keep you from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we are persuaded in Lord toward you, that what we command you, ye both are doing and will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And may the Lord direct your hearts for the love of God, and for the steadfastness of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition, which they received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For ye yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us. Because we did not act disorderly among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat bread gratis from any man, but in labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we have no right, but that we might give ourselves an example to you, in order to imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you we commanded you this, that if any man will not work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but being busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now to such men we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with quietness, they should eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But ye, brothers, do not become weary doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace through everything in every way. The Lord is with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of Paul by my hand, which is a mark in every letter I write this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with all of you. Truly.</verse>
