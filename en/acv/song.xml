        <verse osisID='Song.1.2'>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>Thine oils have a good fragrance. Thy name is oil poured forth. Therefore the virgins love thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.4'>Draw me, we will run after thee. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will be glad and rejoice in thee. We will make mention of thy love more than of wine. Rightly do they love thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me. They made me keeper of the vineyards, [but] my own vineyard I have not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loves, where thou feed [thy flock], where thou make [it] to rest at noon. For why should I be as she who is veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.9'>I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.10'>Thy cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], thy neck with strings of jewels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.1'>I am a rose of Sharon. A lily of the valleys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.2'>As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.3'>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.4'>He brought me to the banquet house, and his banner over me was love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.5'>Sustain ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick from love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.6'>His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand embraces me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.7'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall. He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For, lo, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.12'>The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>The fig tree ripens her green figs, and the vines are in blossom. They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, who are in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance; let me hear thy voice. For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards. For our vineyards are in blossom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved is mine, and I am his. He feeds among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.1'>By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.2'>[I said], I will rise now, and go around the city. In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen who go about the city found me. [I said], Did ye see him whom my soul loves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>It was but a little that I passed from them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.6'>Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.7'>Behold, it is the litter of Solomon. Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>They all handle the sword, [and] are expert in war. Every man has his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seat thereof of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother has crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, thou are fair, my love, behold, thou are fair. Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that lay along the side of mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn, which have come up from the washing, of which every one has twins, and none is bereaved among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.5'>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>Thou are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>Thou have ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride. Thou have ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is thy love than wine, and the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Thy lips, O [my] bride, drop the honeycomb. Honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits, henna with spikenard plants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.15'>[Thou are] a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.16'>Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south, blow upon my garden, that the spices of it may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I have come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey. I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends. Drink, yea. Drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I was asleep, but my heart awoke. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. For my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands drops with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him. I called him, but he gave me no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen who go about the city found me. They smote me, they wounded me. The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him that I am sick from love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.9'>What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, that thou do so adjure us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.10'>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, banks of sweet herbs. His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands are rings of gold set with beryl. His body is ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.3'>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine. He feeds among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.4'>Thou are fair, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, sublime as an army with banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.5'>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that lay along the side of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.6'>Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing, of which every one has twins, and none is bereaved among them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove, my undefiled, is [but] one. She is the only one of her mother. She is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed, [yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is she who looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, sublime as an army with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, [and] the pomegranates were in flower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Before I was aware, my soul set me [among] the chariots of my princely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of two armies?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilful workman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Thy body is a round goblet, no mingled wine is wanting. Thy waist is a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Thy neck is like the tower of ivory. Thine eyes, the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple. The king is held captive in the tresses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of the branches of it. Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>and thy mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips and teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.12'>Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give thee my love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes give forth fragrance. And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>Oh that thou were as my brother, who sucked the breasts of my mother! [When] I should find thee outside, I would kiss thee. Yes, and none would despise me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead thee, [and] bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me. I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.3'>His left hand under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.4'>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.5'>Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awoke thee. There thy mother was in travail with thee. There she who brought thee forth was in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm. For love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as Sheol. The flashes of it are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.9'>If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.10'>I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers. Then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.11'>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon. He let out the vineyard to keepers. Every one for the fruit of it was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.12'>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand, and those who keep the fruit of it, two hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.13'>Thou who dwell in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice. Cause me to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.14'>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</verse>
