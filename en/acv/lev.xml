        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for LORD by thy estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it be from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it be a beast, of which men offer an oblation to LORD, all that any man gives of such to LORD shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad. As thou the priest values it, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to thy estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad. As the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man shall sanctify to LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing of it, the sowing of a homer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to LORD, as a field set apart; the possession of it shall be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if he sanctifies to LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation to the year of jubilee, and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to LORD, no man shall sanctify it, whether it be ox or sheep, it is LORD's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it, or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding, nothing set apart, that a man shall set apart to LORD of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is most holy to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>No one set apart, who shall be set apart from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is LORD's; it is holy to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel on mount Sinai.</verse>
