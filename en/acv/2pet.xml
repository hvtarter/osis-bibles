      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simon Peter, a bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>as all things of his divine power to us, things toward life and piety, which were granted through the knowledge of him who called us through glory and virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>Because of which, the precious and greatest promises have been given to us, so that through these ye might become companions of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>Now this same thing also, having applied all eagerness, furnish in your faith, virtue, and in virtue, knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and in knowledge, self-control, and in self-control, perseverance, and in perseverance, piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and in piety, brotherly affection, and in brotherly affection, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For these things existing in you and abounding, it leads to not being idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being near-sighted, having deliberately forgotten the purification of his former sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, instead be diligent to make your calling and selection sure, for doing these things, ye would, no, not ever stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For so the entrance will be furnished to you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I will not neglect to always remind you about these things, although having known them, and having been established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>But I think it right, inasmuch as I am in this tent, to arouse you in memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>Knowing that the putting off of my tent is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And also I will endeavor for you to always have, after my departure, the memory of these things to apply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we revealed to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, not men who followed in cunningly devised myths, but men who became eyewitnesses of the majesty of that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For having received from God the Father honor and glory from a voice of such kind brought to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And we heard this voice, which was brought out of heaven, being with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And we have the prophetic word sure, to which ye do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the daystar arises in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture comes to pass of a personal interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>For no prophecy was ever brought by a will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being led by Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But FALSE prophets also developed among the people, as FALSE teachers will also be among you, who will sneak in pernicious denominations, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their wantonness, because of whom the way of the truth will be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And they will exploit you in greed with fabricated words, whose judgment is not idle for long, and their destruction will not slumber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare heavenly agents who sinned, but delivered them up to chains of darkness, having been cast into hell being reserved for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, the eighth, a herald of righteousness, when he brought on a flood upon the world of the irreverent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, being reduced to ashes, having made an example of men who were going to be irreverent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and he rescued righteous Lot, being distressed by the conduct of the lawless in their licentiousness</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man dwelling among them day after day, in the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, it anguished his righteous soul),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>the Lord knows how to rescue the pious out of temptation, and to hold in reserve unrighteous men being cut off for a day of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>And especially those going rear of flesh in a degenerate lust, and who despise lordship. Reckless, self-willed men, they do not tremble when speaking evil of dignities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>Whereas heavenly agents, being greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these men, like irrational beasts of nature, having been born for capture and destruction, speaking evil at which things they do not understand, will be destroyed in their corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>getting back a wage of unrighteousness. Men who consider soft living in the daytime to be pleasure, spots and blemishes reveling in their deceitfulness, feasting together with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery, and unceasing sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, children of a curse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>having forsaked a straight path, they were led astray, men who followed the way of Balaam, son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>But he had a rebuke of his own lawbreaking. A mute donkey, uttering in a man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These men are waterless wells, and clouds driven by a fierce wind, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved into an age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For, uttering swollen things of vanity, they entice (to sensuality by lusts of flesh) those who actually escaped from those who live in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them freedom, while they themselves are bondmen of corruption, for by what any man has been overcome, of this he has also been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and, having been again entangled in these, they are overcome, the last things have become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But that of the TRUE proverb has happened to them, The dog returning to his own vomit, and the sow that washed to wallowing in mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>I write to you now this second letter, beloved, in which I arouse your sincere mind by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the sayings that were earlier spoken by the holy prophets, and of the command of your apostles of the Lord and Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>Knowing this first, that there will come at the end of the days, scoffers, proceeding according to their own desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from since the fathers became asleep, all things continue this way from the beginning of creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this is willfully ignored by them, that long ago there were heavens, and an earth that came together out of water and by water by the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which the world then perished, having been overflowed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But now the heavens and the earth, which have been stored up by the same word, are being preserved for fire in a day of judgment and destruction of irreverent men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But beloved, this one thing you should not ignore, that one day with Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not slack about his promise, as some regard slackness, but is patient toward us, not wanting any to perish, but all to go forward to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of Lord will come as a thief in the night, during which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, being intensely hot, will be disintegrated, and the earth and the works in it will be destroyed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Therefore, all these things being disintegrated, what kind ought ye to be in holy actions and pieties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>anticipating and hastening the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens, being made fiery hot, will be disintegrated, and the elements dissolve, being intensely hot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But we anticipate a new heavens and a new earth according to his promise, in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, anticipating these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, without spot and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And consider the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation, just as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Ye therefore, beloved, knowing in advance, keep watch, lest, having accommodated to the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him is the glory both now and into the day of the age. Truly.</verse>
