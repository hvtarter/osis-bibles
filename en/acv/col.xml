      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying about you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love toward all the sanctified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope being reserved for you in the heavens, which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the good-news</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>being present for you, just as also in all the world. And it is bearing fruit and increasing, just as also among you from the day that ye heard and recognized the grace of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>Just as also ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow bondman, who is a faithful helper of the Christ for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>the man who also made clear to us your love in Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>Because of this we also, from the day that we heard, cease not praying for you and making request that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>For you to walk worthily of the Lord for every desire to please, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing in the knowledge of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>being strengthened in every ability, according to the dominion of his glory, for all perseverance and longsuffering with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>Giving thanks to the Father who made us qualified for the share of the portion of the sanctified in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>Who rescued us out of the power of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is an image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>Because in him all things were created, things in the heavens and things upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or lordships or principal offices or positions of authority, all things have been created</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And he is before all, and in him all things hold together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might become preeminent in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>Because in him it was considered good for all the fullness dwell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross, through him whether things upon the earth or things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you, being formerly alienated and hostile in mind, in works, in things evil. But now he has reconciled</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblemished and unblameable before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>If ye truly continue in the faith, founded, and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good-news that ye heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I Paul became a helper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I now rejoice in sufferings for you, and make complete in my flesh things lacking of the afflictions of the Christ for his body, which is the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>Of which I became a helper according to the administration of God, which was given to me for you to fulfill the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the mystery that was hidden from the ages and from the generations, but has now been made known to his sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To whom God wanted to make known what is the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>Whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>For which also I labor, striving according to his working, which works in me with power.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have about you, and those at Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>So that their hearts may be encouraged, having been united together in love, and for all wealth of the full assurance of understanding, to knowledge of the mystery of the God and Father of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>And I say this so that not any man may delude you with persuasive speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For even though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your orderliness, and the steadfastness of your faith for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as ye were taught, abounding in it with thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Take heed lest there will be any man taking you captive through the love of wisdom and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>Because in him all the fullness of the divinity dwells bodily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And ye are men who have been made full in him, who is the head of every principal office and position of authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In whom also ye were circumcised a circumcision not made with hands, in the removal of the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>Having been buried with him in immersion, in which also ye were raised together through faith of the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you, being dead in transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you he made alive together with him, having forgiven us all the transgressions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having erased the handwriting against us in the regulations that were hostile to us, and he has taken it up from the midst, having nailed it to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>Having stripped the principal offices and the positions of authority, he exposed them openly, having triumphed over them by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let not any man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the things coming, but the body is Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no man umpire against you insisting on self-mortification, and worship of the heavenly agents, intruding in things that he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding to the head, from whom all the body, being supplied and held together through the connections and bonds, develops its growth from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why do ye submit to rules, as though living in the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>(which are all things for consumption by use), according to the commandments and teachings of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>Which having, are indeed a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and self-mortification, and austerity of the body--not in any value against indulgence of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If therefore ye were raised with the Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Think on the things above, not the things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For ye died, and your life has been hidden with the Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When the Christ, our life, is made known, then ye also will be made known with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death therefore your body-parts on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>Because of which the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which ye also once walked when ye lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now ye also, put off all these things: anger, wrath, wickedness, reviling, filthy speaking out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to each other, having stripped off the old man with his practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and having put on the new man, being renewed in knowledge according to an image of him who created him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman, but the all and in all, Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on therefore, as chosen men of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, longsuffering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>forbearing each other, and forgiving yourselves, if any man has a complaint against any, just as also the Christ forgave you, so also ye,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>and above all these things, love, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of God umpire in your hearts, for which also ye were called in one body, and become thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing by grace in your hearts to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And all things, anything whatever ye may do in word or in deed, do all in the name of Lord Jesus, expressing thanks to the God and Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be ye submissive to your own husbands as is proper in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love the wives and do not be made bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they may not be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Bondmen, obey in all things those masters according to flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And all things, anything whatever ye may do, work from soul as to the Lord and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from Lord ye will receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>And he who does wrong will be recompensed what he did wrong, and there is no partiality.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, present to the bondmen what is right and equitable, knowing that ye also have a Master in heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue in prayer, being vigilant in it with thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>Praying simultaneously about us also, so that God may open to us a door of the word, to speak the mystery of the Christ, because of which I have also been bound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>so that I may make it known as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward those outside, redeeming the time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>your speech always with grace seasoned with salt, to know how it is fitting for you to answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>Tychicus will make known to you all things about me, the beloved brother and faithful helper and fellow bondman in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>Whom I sent to you for this same thing, so that he may know the things about you, and may encourage your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother who is of you. They will make known to you all things here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom ye received orders, if he comes to you, welcome him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus who is called Justus, these being the only fellow workmen from the circumcision for the kingdom of God, men who became a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, the bondman of Christ from you, salutes you, always striving for you in prayers, so that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I testify about him, that he has much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Salute the brothers in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly associated with his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when the letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the congregation of Laodiceans, and that ye also read the one from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Watch the ministry that thou received in Lord so that thou may fulfill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation of Paul by my hand. Remember my bonds. Grace is with you. Truly.</verse>
