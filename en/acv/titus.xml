  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a bondman of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the knowledge of truth according to piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life, which the non-lying God promised before times eternal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but in his own times he made known his word by preaching, which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, a genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>I left thee behind in Crete on account of this: That thou should set in order the things lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not with an accusation of debauchery or insubordinate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God, not self-willed, not prone to angry, not a drunkard, not a fighter, not greedy of base gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but a lover of strangers, a lover of good, serious minded, just, devout, self-controlled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding firm the faithful word according to the teaching, so that he may also be able to exhort by the sound doctrine, and to correct those who contradict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are also many insubordinate men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those from circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>who must be muzzled, men who subvert whole houses, teaching things that they ought not, for sake of ugly profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>A certain man of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true, because of which reason, reprove them harshly, so that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish myths, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>Truly to the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but in their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and worthless for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak thou the things that are fitting for the sound doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>Aged men are to be without wine, noble, serious minded, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>Aged women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>so that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be serious-minded, pure, homemakers, good, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise exhort the younger men to be sober-minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>Concerning all things presenting thyself a pattern of good works in the doctrine: incorruption, dignity, incorruptibility,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech, irreproachable, so that the man of opposition may be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Bondmen are to be obedient to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in all things, not speaking contrary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not pilfering, but demonstrating all good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>disciplining us, so that, having denied irreverence and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and piously in the present age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Awaiting the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us, so that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a special people, a zealot of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak and exhort and rebuke with every command. Let no man disregard thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be submissive to principle offices and positions of authority, to be obedient, to be prepared for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to slander no man, to be noncontentious, meek, showing all mildness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we also were formerly foolish, disobedient, being led astray, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in evil and envy, hateful, hating each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Savior appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>he saved us, not of works in righteousness that we did, but according to his mercy through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>So that, having been made righteous by the grace of that man, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>Faithful is the saying. And I want thee to strongly insist about these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to manage good works. These things are good and beneficial to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questionings, and genealogies, and contentions, and legal fightings, for they are useless and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Shun a factious man after a first and second admonition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a man is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I will send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus. Be diligence to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way diligently, so that nothing may be lacking for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And also let our men learn to be in the lead of good works for the essential needs, so that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All those with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in faith. Grace is with all of you. Truly.</verse>
