        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>to know wisdom and instruction, to discern the words of understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness and justice and equity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb, and a figure, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of LORD is the beginning of knowledge. The foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shall be a garland of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us. Let us lay wait for blood. Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all precious substance. We shall fill our houses with spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Thou shall cast thy lot among us. We will all have one bag.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not thou in the way with them. Restrain thy foot from their path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>and these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain. It takes away the life of the owners of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the broad places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She cries in the chief place of concourse, at the entrance of the gates, in the city. She utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn back at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you. I will make my words known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>but ye have made all my counsel void, and want none of my reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when your fear comes as a storm, and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the backsliding of the simple shall kill them, and the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But he who hearkens to me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if thou will receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>so as to incline thine ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>yea, if thou cry after discernment, and lift up thy voice for understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>if thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then thou shall understand the fear of LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For LORD gives wisdom. Out of his mouth [is] knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright, a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then thou shall understand righteousness and justice and equity, [yea], every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>discretion shall watch over thee, understanding shall keep thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>to deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>to deliver thee from the interloping woman, even from the stranger who flatters with her words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the companion of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>(for her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>none who go to her return again, nor do they attain to the paths of life),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>that thou may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, do not forget my law, but let thy heart keep my commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days, and years of life, and peace, they will add to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee. Bind them about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>so thou shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in LORD with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>so thy barns shall be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of LORD, nor be weary of his reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom LORD loves he reproves, and he whips every son whom he receives (LXX/NT).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gain of it is better than the gain of silver, and the profit of it than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies, and none of the things thou can desire are to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand, in her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her. And happy is everyone who retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>LORD by wisdom founded the earth. By understanding he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>so they shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then thou shall walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When thou lay down, thou shall not be afraid. Yea, thou shall lay down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Do not say to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give, when thou have it by thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Do not devise evil against thy neighbor, since he dwells securely by thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done thee no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Do not envy thou the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse man is an abomination to LORD, but his friendship is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of LORD is in the house of a wicked man, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely the Lord is opposed to the arrogant (LXX/NT), but he gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you good doctrine. Forsake ye not my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was a son to my father, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>And he taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.7'>Wisdom [is] the principal thing. Get wisdom, yea, with all thy getting get understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.8'>Exalt her, and she will promote thee. She will bring thee to honor when thou embrace her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.9'>She will give to thy head a garland of grace, a crown of beauty she will deliver to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom. I have led thee in paths of uprightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.12'>When thou go, thy steps shall not be restricted. And if thou run, thou shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.13'>Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go. Keep her, for she is thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.14'>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it. Do not pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they do not sleep unless they do evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they cause to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is as darkness. They know not at what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, attend to my words. Incline thine ear to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep them in the midst of thy heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.23'>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.24'>Put away from thee a wayward mouth, and put perverse lips far from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.25'>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.26'>Make the path of thy feet level, and let all thy ways be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.27'>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. Remove thy foot from evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>that thou may preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of an interloping woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold on Sheol,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>so that she does not find the level path of life. Her ways are unstable, [and] she does not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove thy way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>lest thou give thine honor to others, and thy years to the cruel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labors [be] in the house of an alien,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>and thou mourn at thy latter end when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the assembly and congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, and streams of water in the streets?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.17'>Let them be for thyself alone, and not for strangers with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.18'>Let thy fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of thy youth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.19'>a loving hind and a pleasant doe. Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou ravished always with her love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.20'>For why should thou, my son, be ravished with an interloping woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For the ways of man are before the eyes of LORD, and he makes level all his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>His own iniquities shall take a wicked man, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>who winks with his eyes, who speaks with his feet, who makes signs with his fingers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who sows discord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly. Suddenly he shall be broken, and that without remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>There are six things which LORD hates, yea, seven which are an abomination to him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Do not lust after her beauty in thy heart, nor let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.26'>For the price of a harlot is as much as a piece of bread, but the adulteress hunts for the precious life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.27'>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.30.31'>the greyhound, also the he-goat, and the king against whom there is no rising up.</verse>
