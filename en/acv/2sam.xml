      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn, and earth upon his head. And so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground, and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him, From where did thou come? And he said to him, I escaped out of the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, How did the matter go? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man who told him, How do thou know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man who told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed close after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, Who are thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and kill me, for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen. And I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them, and likewise all the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man who told him, From where are thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said to him, Why were thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy LORD's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head, for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain LORD's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(and he bade them teach the sons of Judah [the song of] the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan, men who were loved and pleasant, undivided; comely in their lives, and undivided in their death; swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you delicately in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan. Very pleasant thou have been to me. Thy love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were those who buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of LORD, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now LORD show loving kindness and truth to you. And I also will reward you this kindness because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And each man caught his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And the battle was very severe that day. And Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me. Why should I smite thee to the ground? How then would I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him. And he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it came to pass, that as many</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner. And the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah that lays before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? Know thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before thou bid the people return from following their brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, As God lives unless thou had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every man from followed his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew the trumpet. And all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah, and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from following Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and sixty men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born to David in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite, and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith, and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Why have thou gone in to my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then Abner was very angry for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This day I show kindness to the house of Saul thy father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee i</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as LORD has sworn to David, I do not even so to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner another word because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? [And] saying, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Well! I will make a league with thee, but one thing I require of thee. That is, thou shall not see my face unless thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou come to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, Go, return, and he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then do it, for LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner also went to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou may reign over all that thy soul desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them, but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the army that was with him came, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have thou done? Behold, Abner came to thee. Why is it that thou have sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Thou know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David knew it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house. And let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the sons of iniquity, so did thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day, but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, till the sun is down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day weak, though anointed king, and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. LORD reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when [Ish-bosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And [Ish-bosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands. The name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for Beeroth also is reckoned to</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled. And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that h</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came there into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat, and they smote him in the body. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life. And LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of h</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when he who told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when evil men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou who led out and brought in Israel. And LORD said to thee, Thou shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shall be prince over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.5'>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse says, and the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The Spirit of LORD spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me. He who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>[he shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, [when] the tender grass [springs] out of the earth, through clear shining after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Truly my house is not so with God. Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire, though he does not make it to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But the worthless shall be as thorns to be thrust away, all of them, because they cannot be taken with the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear, and they shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And LORD wrought a great victory that day, and the people returned after him only to take spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines. And LORD wrought a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this, [to drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Was he not most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he did not attain to the [first] three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he killed an Egyptian, a good-looking man. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name among the three mighty men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And again the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>And the king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said to the king, Now LORD thy God add to the people, however many they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. And they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites. And they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone to and from through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to LORD, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done, but now, O LORD, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foo</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And when David rose up in the morning, the word of LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and speak to David, Thus says LORD, I offer thee three things. Choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? Or will thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. Let us fall now into the hand of LORD, for his mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
