        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who know the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth that abides in us, and will be with us into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father, and from Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoice exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but what we had from the beginning, that we would love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>Because many deceivers have gone forth into the world, those not acknowledging Jesus Christ coming in flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Watch yourselves, so that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Every man transgressing, and not abiding in the doctrine of the Christ, does not have God. The man abiding in the doctrine of the Christ, this man has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any man comes to you, and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into a house, and do not speak to him to rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he who speaks to him to rejoice, partakes of his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things, I did not want to write to you by paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, so that our joy may be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thy chosen sister salute thee. Truly.</verse>
