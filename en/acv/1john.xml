      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>(and the life was made known, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father, and was made known to us),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that ye also may have fellowship with us. Even also our fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And we write these things to you, so that our joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from every sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so that he will forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from every unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I write these things to you so that ye may not sin. And if any man does sin, we have an advocate with the Father--righteous Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And he is the atonement for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever keeps his word, truly in this man the love of God is fully perfected. By this we know that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who claims to abide in him he also ought so to walk just as that man walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment that ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that ye heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, a new commandment I write to you, which is TRUE in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the TRUE light now shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who claims to be in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and no cause of stumbling is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and he goes about in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you through his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome evil. I write to you, children, because ye know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I wrote to you, fathers, because ye have know him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>Because everything in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the arrogance of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world passes away, and the lust of it, but he who does the will of God abides into the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Children, it is the last hour. And as ye heard that the antichrist comes, and now many antichrists have developed, from which we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they were of us, they would have continued with us, but--so that they might be made known, that they are not all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>And ye have an anointing from the Holy, and ye know all the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I wrote to you not because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Every man who denies the Son, also does not have the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Therefore ye, let what ye heard from the beginning abide in you. If what ye heard from the beginning abides in you, ye also will abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise that he promised us: the eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I wrote these things to you concerning those who lead you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>And for you, the anointing that ye received from him abides in you, and ye have no need that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you about all things, and is TRUE and is no lie, and just as it taught you, ye will a</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is made known, we may have confidence, and not be shamed by him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every man doing righteousness has been begotten of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we may be called children of God. Because of this the world does not know you, because it did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet made known what we will be. But we know that whenever he is made known we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every man who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that man is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Every man doing sin also does lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And ye know that that man was made known so that he might take up our sins. And in him is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Every man abiding in him does not sin. Every man who is sinning has not seen him, nor has known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no man lead you astray. He who is doing righteousness is righteous, just as that man is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who is doing sin is of the devil, because the devil sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was made known for this, so that he might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Every man who has been begotten of God is not doing sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this the children of God are visible, and the children of the devil. Every man not doing righteousness is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>Because this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>Not as Cain. He was of the wicked, and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were wrong, and his brother's right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who is not loving the brother abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Every man hating his brother is a man-killer. And ye know that no man-killer has eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we know love, because that man laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoever has the world's living, and sees his brother having need, and closes his bowels from him, how does the love of God abide in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My Little children, we should not love in word, nor with the tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And by this we know that we are of the truth, and will assure our hearts before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>Because if our heart should condemn us, that God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart should not condemn us, we have confidence toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatever we may ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do things pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love each other, just as he gave command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, from the Spirit that he gave us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but examine the spirits, whether they are of God, because many FALSE prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ having come in flesh is of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ has come in flesh is not of God. And this is that of the antichrist, which ye have heard that it comes, and is now in the world already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>Ye are of God, little children, and ye have overcome them, because greater is he in you than he in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world. Because of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God. He who knows God hears us. He who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, we should love each other. Because love is of God, and every man who loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>By this the love of God was made known in us, because God sent his Son, the only begotten, into the world so that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, an atonement for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also are obligated to love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No man has ever seen God. If we love each other, God abides in us, and his love is in us, having been fully perfected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>In this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us from his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son, a Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And we know, and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>By this love has been fully perfected with us, so that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because just as that man is, we also are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>Fear is not in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear holds punishment, and he who is afraid has not been fully perfected in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love him, because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If any man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And we have this commandment from him, so that he who loves God will also love his brother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Every man who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten from God, and every man who loves him who begot, also loves him who has been begotten from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we may keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>Because everything that has been begotten from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>And who is he who overcomes the world, if not he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And it is the Spirit that testifies, because the Spirit is truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>Because those who testify are three:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. And the three are in one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Because this is the testimony of God that he has testified about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the testimony, that God gave eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I wrote these things to you, those who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any man may see his brother sinning a sin not toward death, he will ask, and he will give life to him, to those not sinning toward death. There is sin toward death. I do not say that he should make request about that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin. And there is sin not toward death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that every man who has been begotten from God does not sin, but he who was begotten from God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is set in the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>And we know that the Son of God comes, and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true. And we are in the true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the TRUE God, and the eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, guard yourselves from the idols. Truly.</verse>
