      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, a beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I have gratitude to God whom I serve from the forefathers in a pure conscience, as I have unceasing remembrance about thee in my supplications, night and day</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see thee, having remembered thy tears, so that I may be filled with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>taking memory of the non-hypocritical faith in thee, which first dwelt in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that is in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>Because of which reason I remind thee to rekindle the gift of God that is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner, but suffer together with the good-news according to the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>Who saved us and who called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But which has now been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who indeed abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the good-news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>for which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>Because of which reason I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to preserve my consignment for that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold the pattern of sound words that thou heard from me, in faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>Guard the good consignment through the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This thou know, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>But when he happened to be in Rome he sought me more diligently and found me</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>(may the Lord grant him to find mercy from Lord in that day), and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou know very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And what thou have heard from me through many witnesses, these things commit thou to faithful men who will be competent to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Thou therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man who serves in the military entangles himself in the affairs of life, so that he may please the man who enlisted the army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And also if any man competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The farmer who labors must be the first to partake of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say, for may the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good-news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>within which I suffer evil to the point of bonds as an evildoer, but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Because of this I endure all things because of the chosen, so that they also may experience salvation in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>Faithful is the saying, For if we die together, we will also live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we endure, we will also reign together. If we renounce him, that man will also renounce us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we are unfaithful, that man remains faithful. He cannot renounce himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind them of these things, solemnly testifying in the sight of the Lord, not to brawl verbally, to nothing useful, to the ruin of those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Be diligent to present thyself approved to God, an irreproachable workman, correctly traversing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But shun profane babblings, for they will advance to greater impiety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their word will have a feeding field like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>men who missed the mark about the truth, saying the resurrection happened already, and they overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Nevertheless the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, Lord knows those who are his, and, Let every man who names the name of Lord keep away from unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen, and some for esteem and some for disesteem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If therefore any man purges himself from these things, he will be a vessel for esteem, sanctified and useful to the master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>And flee juvenile impulses, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But shun foolish and uneducated questions, knowing that they breed quarrels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And a bondman of Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in mildness correcting those who oppose. Perhaps God may grant them repentance for recognition of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may sober up out of the snare of the devil, having been captured by him for his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, impious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>devoid of natural affection, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, no lovers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form of piety, but repudiating the power of it. Now turn away from these men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>for from these are those who creep into houses, and take captive petty women laden with sins, being led away by various impulses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>ever learning and never able to come to knowledge of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And by which way Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also do these oppose the truth. Men corrupted in mind, worthless about the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they will not advance in much more, for their folly will be evident to all men, as also that of those men came to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But thou have closely followed my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and the Lord rescued me out of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>And also all those who want to live devoutly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But continue thou in what thou learned and were convinced of, knowing from whom thou learned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that from a babe thou have known the sacred writings, which are able to make thee wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for instruction, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>so that the man of God may be qualified, having been completed for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I solemnly testify therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is going to judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word, stand ready in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For there will be time when they will not tolerate sound doctrine, but they will accumulate teachers to themselves according to their own desires, who tickle the ear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and will indeed turn the ear away from the truth, and will be turned aside to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But be thou sober in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, bring thy ministry to fullness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already poured out a libation, and the time of my dissolution is imminent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me in that day, and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Hurry to come to me quickly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas forsook me having loved the present age, and he went to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Having taken Mark, bring him with thee, for he is useful to me for service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>Bring the cloak that I left behind at Troas with Carpus when thou come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me. May the Lord repay him according to his works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom thou also beware, for he extremely opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defense no man came with me, but all forsook me. May it not be reckoned to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the sacred message might be brought to fullness, and all the Gentiles might hear. And I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will rescue me from every evil work, and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left being sick at Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Hurry to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ is with thy spirit. Grace is with you. Truly.</verse>
