      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>that in those days, when king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his rulers and his servants, the power of Persia and Media, the ranking men and rulers of the provinces, being before him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and eighty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble. The couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and white and yellow</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking was according to the law, none could compel. For so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains who ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to show the peoples and the rulers her beauty, for she was fair to look on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains. Therefore the king was very angry, and his fury burned in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law and judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shall we do to queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the rulers, Vashti the queen has not done wrong only to the king, but also to all the rulers, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes when it shall be reported, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she did not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>And this day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen will say [the like] to all the king's rulers. So [there will arise] much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and let the king gi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the saying pleased the king and the rulers, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the la</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keepe</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter. For she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful. And when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house to the custody of Heg</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. And he quickly gave her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were suitable to be given her out of the king's house. And he removed her</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to king Ahasuerus, after it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [namely], six months with</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>then the maiden came to the king in this way: Whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more unless the king delighted in h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appoint</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther above all the women. And she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great feast to all his rulers and his servants, even Esther's feast, and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her. For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it to Esther the queen, and Esther told the king [of it] in Mordecai's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when inquiry was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the rulers that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down, nor did him reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do thou transgress the king's commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not hearken to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down, nor did him reverence, then Haman was full of wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people, nor do they keep the king's</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed. And I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the [king's] business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then the king's scribes were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it. And there was written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the r</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little sons and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>A copy of the writing that the decree should be given out in every province was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And he came even before the king's gate, for none might enter inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it to her. And the queen was exceedingly grieved. And she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him, but he did not receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king to make supplication to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai [saying,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told Esther's words to Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai bade them return answer to Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if thou altogether keep quiet at this time, then relief and deliverance will arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish. And who knows whether thou have not come to the kingdom for such a</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther bade them return answer to Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast in like manner. And so I will go in to the king, which is not acc</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entran</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then the king said to her, What will thou, queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then Esther answered, and said, My petition and my request is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home, and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the rulers and servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it. Then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And t</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night the king could not sleep. And he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those who kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, There is nothing done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman came into the outward court of the king's house to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>And Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and on the head of which a royal crown is set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>And let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble rulers, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delights to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the</verse>

        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house, mourning and having his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom thou have begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shal</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>While they were yet talking with him, the king's chamberlains came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.</verse>
