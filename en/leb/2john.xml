        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I alone, but also all those who know the truth—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth that resides in us and will be with us ˻forever˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>˻I was very glad˼ because I found some of your children walking in the truth, just as ˻the Father commanded us˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I ask you, lady (not as if I were writing a new commandment to you, but one that we have had from the beginning), that we should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This person is the deceiver and the antichrist!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Watch yourselves that you do not lose what we have worked for, but receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Everyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in the teaching—this person has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not speak a greeting to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>because the one who speaks a greeting to him shares in his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so by means of paper and ink, but I hope to be with you and to speak ˻face to face˼, so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you.</verse>
