  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>Although God spoke long ago in many parts and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of his power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did he ever say,“You are my son,today I have fathered you,”and again,“I will be ˻his father˼,and he will be ˻my son˼”?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,“And let all the angels of God worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And concerning the angels he says,“The one who makes his angels winds,and his servants a flame of fire,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>but concerning the Son,“Your throne, O God, is˻forever and ever˼,and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;because of this God, your God, has anointed youwith the olive oil of joy more than your companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And,“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,and the heavens are the works of your hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>they will perish, but you continue,and they will all become old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like a robe you will roll them up,and like a garment they will be changed;but you are the same, and your years will not run out.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels has he ever said,“Sit down at my right hand,until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But someone testified somewhere, saying,“What is man, that you remember him,or the son of man, that you care for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him for a short time lower than the angels;you crowned him with glory and honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>you subjected all things under his feet.For in subjecting all things to him, he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he might taste death on behalf of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying,“I will proclaim your name to my brothers;in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again,“I will trust in him.”And again,“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that which he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all thingsis God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ was faithful as a son over his house, whose house we are, if indeed we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,“Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,in the day of testing in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers tested me by trialand saw my works</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>for forty years.Therefore I was angry with this generation,and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,and they do not know my ways.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>As I swore in my anger,‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, with the result that you fall away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But encourage one another ˻day by day˼, as long as it is called “today,” so that ˻none of you become hardened˼ by the deception of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our commitment steadfast until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>˻while it is said˼,“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For who, when they heard it, were disobedient? Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore let us fear, while there remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>˻For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us˼, just as those also did, but the message ˻they heard˼ did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who heard it in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed enter into that rest, just as he has said,“As I swore in my anger,‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this passage again, ‘˻They will never enter˼ into my rest.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before,“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God did from his own works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom ˻we must give our account˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins ˻for himself also, as well as for the people˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,“You are my Son, today I have fathered you,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>just as also in another place he says,“You are a priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning this ˻we have much to say and it is difficult to explain˼, since you have become sluggish in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For indeed, although you ought to be teachers ˻by this time˼, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and ˻you have need of˼ milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, to renew them again to repentence, because they have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people˻for whose sake˼it is also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to a curse, whose end is for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and belonging to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name by having served the saints, and continuing to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying,“Surely ˻I will greatly bless˼ you, and ˻I will greatly multiply˼ you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, by persevering, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For people swear by what is greater than themselves, and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In the same way God, because he wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed it with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, because he became a high priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything—in the first place, his name is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But see how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although ˻they are descended from Abraham˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And, ˻so to speak˼, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is testified,“You are a priest ˻forever˼ according to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And by as much as this was not without an oath (for these on the one hand ˻have become priests˼ without an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>but he with an oath by the one who said to him,“The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,‘You are a priest ˻forever˼’ ”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And indeed many ˻have become˼ priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because he continues ˻forever˼, holds the priesthood permanently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted above the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not ˻need every day˼ like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, appoints a Son, who is made perfect ˻forever˼.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now this is the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was necessary for this one also to have something that he offers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are those who offer the gifts according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first covenant had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For in finding fault with them he says,“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israeland with the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not like the covenant which I made with their fatherson the day I took hold of them by my handto lead them out of the land of Egypt,because they did not continue in my covenantand I disregarded them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israelafter those days, says the Lord:I am putting my laws in their mindsand I will write them on their hearts,and I will be ˻their˼ Godand they will be ˻my˼ people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they will not teach each one his fellow citizenand each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’because they will all know me,from the least of them to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings,and I will not remember their sins any longer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In calling it new, he has declared the former to be old. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is near to disappearing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now possible to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent ˻continually˼as they accomplish their service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, while the first tent was still in existence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>concerning instead only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying,“This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary ˻year by year˼ with blood not his own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And ˻just as˼ it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, possessing a shadow of the good things that are about to come, not the form of things itself, is never able ˻year by year˼ by means of the same sacrifices which they offer without interruption to make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in them there is a reminder of sins ˻year by year˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, when he came into the world, he said,“Sacrifice and offering you did not want,but a body you prepared for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—in the roll of the book it is written about me—to do your will, O God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>When he says above,“Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sinyou did not want, nor did you delight in,”which are offered according to the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then he has said,“Behold, I have come to do your will.”He takes away the first in order to establish the second,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this one, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>“This is the covenant that I will decree for themafter those days, says the Lord:I am putting my laws on their hearts,and I will write them on their minds.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>He also says,“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence for the entrance into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us approach with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us think about ˻how to stir one another up to love˼ and good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not abandoning ˻our meeting together˼, as is the habit of some, but encouraging each other, and by so much more as you see the day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know the one who said,“Vengeance is mine, I will repay,”and again,“The Lord will judge his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But remember the former days in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you both sympathized with the prisoners and put up with the seizure of your belongings with joy because you knew that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of endurance, in order that after you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet“a very, very little while,and the one who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But my righteous one will live by faith,and if he shrinks back, my soul is not well pleased with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but among those who have faith to the preservation of our souls.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the realization of what is hoped for, the proof of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by this the people of old were approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain, by which he was approved that he was righteous, because God approved him for his gifts, and through it he still speaks, although he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was taken up, so that he did not experience death, and he was not found, because God took him up. For before his removal, he had been approved ˻as having been pleasing˼ to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren, he received ˻the ability to procreate˼ even ˻past the normal age˼, because he regarded the one who had promised to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>And therefore these were fathered from one man, and he being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those who say such things make clear that they are seeking a homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And if they had been remembering that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things that were going to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, as he was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw the child was handsome, and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>considering ˻reproach endured for the sake of Christ˼ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king, for he persevered as if he saw the invisible one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; the Egyptians, ˻when they made the attempt˼, were drowned.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received back their dead by resurrection. But others were tortured, not accepting release, in order that they might gain a better resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>because God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting aside every weight and ˻the sin that so easily ensnares us˼, let us run with patient endurance the race that has been set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'>For consider the one who endured such hostility against himself by sinners, so that you will not grow weary in your souls and give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.4'>You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood as you struggle against sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons?“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline,or give up when you are corrected by him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>Furthermore, we have had ˻our earthly fathers˼ who disciplined us, and we respected them. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>For they disciplined us for a few days according to what seemed appropriate to them, but he does so for our benefit, in order that we can have a share in his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For here we do not have a permanent city, but we seek the city that is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise ˻continually˼ to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>And do not neglect doing good and generosity, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, and want to conduct ourselves commendably in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>And I especially urge you to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>equip you with every good thing to do his will, carrying out in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>Now I urge you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for indeed I have written to you ˻briefly˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you, if he comes quickly enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace be with all of you.</verse>
