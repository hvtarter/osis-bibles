  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in my every prayer for all of you, making the prayer with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>convinced of this same thing, that the one who began a good work in you will finish it until the day of Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray: that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>so that you may approve what is superior, in order that you may be sincere and blameless in the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Now I want you to know, brothers, that ˻my circumstances˼ have happened instead for the progress of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium and to all the rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare even more to speak the word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ, but some also because of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The latter do so from love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>˻What is the result?˼ Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. But also I will rejoice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if it is to live in the flesh, this is fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>But I am hard pressed ˻between the two options˼, having the desire to depart and to be with Christ, ˻for this is very much better˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But to stay on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And because I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>so that what you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear ˻your circumstances˼, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>complete my joy, so that ˻you are in agreement˼, having the same love, united in spirit, ˻having one purpose˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>each one of you not looking out for ˻his own interests˼, but also each of you looking out for˻the interests˼ of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Think this in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, existing in the form of God,did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himselfby taking the form of a slave,by becoming in the likeness of people.And being found in appearance like a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>he humbled himselfby becoming obedient to the point of death,that is, death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore also God exalted himand graciously granted him the name above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>so that at the name of Jesusevery knee should bow,of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue confessthat Jesus Christ is Lord,to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without grumbling and disputing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>And in the same way also you rejoice and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged when I know ˻your circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like-minded who will sincerely be concerned about ˻your circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For they all seek ˻their own interests˼, not those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see ˻my circumstances˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and servant of my need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but also on me, so that I would not have grief upon grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I am sending him with special urgency, in order that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such people highly honored,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death, risking his life in order that ˻he might make up for your inability to serve me˼.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, but is a safeguard for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not put confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>although I could have confidence even in the flesh.If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>˻circumcised on the eighth day˼, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>˻More than that˼, I even consider all things to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and consider them dung, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and may be found in him, not having my righteousness which is from the law, but which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already received this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it. But I do one thing, forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore as many as are perfect, ˻let us hold this opinion˼, and if you think anything differently, God will reveal this also to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us as an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose God is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our humble body to be conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche ˻to be in agreement˼ in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I ask also you, true yokefellow, help them, who struggled along with me in the gospel with both Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are pleasing, whatever things are commendable, if there is any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>And the things which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last ˻you have renewed your concern for me˼, for whom also you were thinking, but you had no opportunity to express it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how both ˻to make do with little˼ and I know how˻to have an abundance˼. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both ˻to have an abundance˼ and to go without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I am able to do all things by the one who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless you have done well by sharing with me in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>because even in Thessalonica ˻on more than one occasion˼ you sent for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek for the profit that increases to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; ˻I am well supplied˼because I received from Epaphroditus ˻what you had sent˼, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will fulfill your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be the glory ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar’s household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
